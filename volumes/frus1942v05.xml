                        >Foreign Relations</hi> are stated in Department of State Regulation 045 of
                    December 5, 1960, a revision of the order approved on March 26, 1925, by Mr.
                    Frank B. Kellogg, then Secretary of State. The text of the current regulation is
                    printed below:</p>

                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States,
                        Diplomatic Papers</hi>, constitutes the official record of the foreign
                    policy of the United States. These volumes include, subject to necessary
                    security considerations, all documents needed to give a comprehensive record of
                    the major foreign policy decisions within the range of the Department of State’s
                    responsibilities, together with appropriate materials concerning the facts which
                    contributed to the formulation of policies. When further material is needed to
                    supplement the documentation in the Department’s files for a proper
                    understanding of the relevant policies of the United States, such papers should
                    be obtained from other Government agencies.</p>

                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record to be printed in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations of the United States, Diplomatic Papers</hi>, shall be
                    edited by the Historical Office, Bureau of Public Affairs. The editing of the
                    record shall be guided by the principles of historical objectivity. There shall
                    be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in the text
                    the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision. Nothing shall be omitted for the purpose of concealing or
                    glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of policy. However,
                    certain omissions of documents or parts of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list>

                                the American Republics, signed at Habana July 30, 1940; Department

                        <p>The Convention on the Provisional Administration of European Colonies and
                            Possessions in the Americas<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">Signed at Habana,
                                July 30, 1940; for text, see Department of State Treaty Series No.
                                977, or 56 Stat. (pt. 2) 1273.</note> became effective on January 8,
                            1942, when two thirds of the American republics had deposited their
                            respective instruments of ratification. The question arises as to
                            whether the members of the “Emergency Committee” shall constitute the
                            “Inter-American Commission for Territorial Administration” as
                            established by the convention. Neither the convention nor the Act of
                            Habana is clear on this point, although the Act of Habana does state
                            that “as soon as the convention comes into effect, the authority and
                            functions exercised by the committee (Emergency) shall be transferred to
                            the Inter-American Commission for Territorial Administration”. The
                            governments appointed their respective members on the Emergency
                            Committee and no appointments have been made specifically to the
                            Commission under the convention. I think there can <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="pg_2" facs="0014"/>be no question but that it was the
                            general intention to have the Emergency Committee merge into the
                            Commission when the convention became effective, although no definite
                            provision is made for that transfer.</p>
                        <p>All of the governments which have ratified, except Argentina and
                            Colombia, have already designated their representatives on the Emergency
                            Committee. Bolivia, Cuba, Mexico, and Nicaragua have designated members
                            on the Emergency Committee but have not yet ratified the convention.
                            (There is attached herewith a list of the members of the Emergency
                            Committee and also a list of the ratifications of the convention.)<note

                        <p>Under the circumstances it would seem advisable for the Governing Board
                            of the Pan American Union to take cognizance of this situation and at
                            its meeting next week take action which will make definitive the
                            establishment of the Inter-American Commission for Territorial
                            Administration. Dr. Manger<note n="6" xml:id="d1fn6">William Manger,
                                Counselor of the Pan American Union.</note> and I have discussed the
                            procedure, and the most feasible solution would seem to be the Governing
                            Board to adopt a resolution calling upon each member government which
                            has ratified the convention to inform the Pan American Union prior to a
                            definite date (in the near future) of its representative in case it
                            wished to designate a representative on the Commission who is other than
                            its representative on the Emergency Committee. This action has the
                            advantage of not endeavoring to interpret the terms of the convention or
                            to commit any government, since it is doubtful whether the Governing
                            Board has the authority to do either of these things. It would have the
                            advantage, however, of establishing definitively the membership of the
                            Commission by placing the responsibility upon each government to take
                            positive action prior to a certain date. I have discussed this procedure
                            with Mr. Barnes<note n="7" xml:id="d1fn7">Charles M. Barnes, Chief of
                                the Treaty Division.</note> of TD, who agrees.</p>
                        <p>If you agree, Dr. Rowe<note n="8" xml:id="d1fn8">Leo S. Rowe, Director

                            convention and the act were adopted at Habana. I shall be glad to have
                            your views on the proposed solution as soon as possible so that the Pan
                            American Union may be informed accordingly.</p>

                        <p>The passage in the Convention of Habana which provides for the creation
                            of the Commission reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“A commission to be known as the ‘Inter-American Commission for
                                    Territorial Administration’ is hereby established, to be
                                    composed of a representative from each one of the States which
                                    ratifies this convention; it shall be the international
                                    organization to which this convention refers. Once this
                                    convention has become effective, any country which ratifies it
                                    may convoke the first meeting proposing the city in which it is
                                    to be held. The Commission shall elect its chairman, complete
                                    its organization and fix its definitive seat.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The question of whether it would be desirable to convoke a meeting of the
                            Commission appears to depend largely on the status of relations with the
                            Vichy Government.</p>

                            <p>The Second Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the
                                American Republics held at Habana in July 1940 adopted the “Act of
                                Habana” concerning the Provisional Administration of European
                                Colonies and Possessions in the Americas. At the same time there was
                                signed the “Convention on the Provisional Administration of European
                                Colonies and Possessions in the Americas”, to come into effect when
                                two-thirds of the American Republics should have deposited their
                                respective instruments of ratification.</p>
                            <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0017"/>
                            <p>The Act of Havana created an Emergency Committee, composed of one
                                representative of each of the American Republics. It was further
                                stipulated that the powers and functions of this Emergency Committee
                                should be transferred to the “Inter-American Commission for
                                Territorial Administration” as soon as the Convention should come
                                into effect.</p>
                            <p>The Convention has been ratified and the respective instruments of
                                ratification deposited by fourteen, or two-thirds of the signatory
                                Governments and consequently has become effective. While it is clear
                                that the authority and functions of the Emergency Committee, set up
                                under the Act of Habana, shall be transferred to the Inter-American
                                Commission for Territorial Administration provided for in the
                                Convention, it is not clear whether the members appointed to serve
                                on the Emergency Committee also shall be considered as members of
                                the Commission for Territorial Administration.</p>
                            <p>With a view to clarifying the question thus presented it is
                                recommended that the following interpretation and resolution be
                                adopted by the Governing Board: <list>

                                        created by the Act of Habana shall be considered to be a

                                        Commission for Territorial Administration pending

                            Governments of the American Republics he may wish to defer taking any
                            position with respect to them, at least in a definitive way, prior to
                            the convening of the conference and until an opportunity has been
                            afforded of learning fully there the views of all the other

                        <p>849. For the Under Secretary.… He [Rossetti] asked again that you see him
                            before opening session to give him the opportunity to give you the
                            Chilean outlook. He hopes that no resolutions, to which all the American
                            nations cannot agree for reasons peculiar to their own situations, will
                            be introduced since this might indicate to the public a divergence that
                            would be unfortunate. He referred to the Central <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8"

                                xml:id="d8fn15">The Dominican delegation sponsored a proposal for a
                                joint declaration of war. The reaction of the Central American
                                nations seemed to be favorable but the South American countries were
                                not inclined to support the proposal.</note> I gave him the
                            impression that you are counting heavily on Aranha and himself which
                            pleased him. I think that is what he wants and I hope you will see him
                            and give him time to describe the Chilean situation since I feel
                            positive that he is most eager to please us in every way at Rio.</p>

                                paragraph. He says I misunderstood him and that he did not request
                                our reaction as he knew what it must be, and that he delayed his
                                answer to the Japanese Minister pending the restoration to the banks

                                country. In this connection he says Chile’s Minister in Tokyo is
                                practically a prisoner and held incommunicado as are all the
                                American diplomats, and that he is sending for the Japanese Minister

                                is determined to accord similar treatment to him and his staff. He
                                says the relations of Chile with Japan are at the breaking

                                any successor would find it painfully embarrassing to deviate from

                            for the convoying of merchant vessels of the American Republics and for
                            the setting up of inter-American defense machinery. It is in accordance
                            with one of the suggestions advanced by the Chilean Government for
                            inclusion in the agenda for the Conference. I shall cable you the text

                            will be of the greatest value in achieving results beneficial to the
                            cause of inter-American solidarity in these critical times.</p>
                        <p>Please tell him also that as always this Government desires to work in
                            the closest cooperation with the Government of Uruguay at the
                            approaching meeting. To this Government, the main issue presented to the
                            American Republics in the emergency now existing, and in view of the
                            fact that 10 of the 21 republics have declared war upon the Axis powers
                            and 3 others have severed all relations with those powers, is whether
                            the practical solidarity for which Uruguay and the United States have
                            worked so hard during these past 9 years is to be a reality or not.</p>
                        <p>In the opinion of this Government the continued functioning of the Axis
                            diplomatic and consular establishments in the Western Hemisphere creates
                            under present conditions the gravest danger to the security of all of
                            the republics and to the ability of the American governments to take
                            necessary and adequate measures of defense. It is well known that Axis
                            consular officials are reporting continuously on the movements of ships
                            and on defense preparations. It is likewise notorious that the Axis
                            diplomatic missions are engaging in every type of subversive activity
                            and are intervening in the most blatant manner in the purely internal
                            and domestic concerns of the countries where they are stationed in order
                            to foment internal discord and to promote the existence of conditions
                            which are in the highest degree prejudicial to the security of us all.
                            With that in mind, this Government has under consideration the urgent
                            need for the adoption of a resolution couched more or less in the

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Resolves</hi>: First. The American Republics
                                    declare that they regard these acts of aggression against one of
                                    the American Republics as acts of aggression against all of them
                                    and as an immediate threat to the liberty and independence of
                                    the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                                <p>Second. The American Republics reaffirm their complete unity and
                                    their determination to cooperate closely for their mutual
                                    protection until the existing menace has been totally
                                    destroyed.</p>
                                <p>Third. They have determined that those non-American states at war
                                    with nations in the Western Hemisphere have forfeited all right
                                    to treatment as nations with which friendly relations can be

                                <p>Fourth. Consequently, they announce that by reason of their
                                    solidarity and for the purpose of protecting and preserving the
                                    freedom and integrity of the twenty-one Republics of the
                                    Americas, relations, whether political, commercial, or
                                    financial, can no longer be maintained by any of them with
                                    Germany, Italy, and Japan, and they likewise declare that, with
                                    full respect for their respective sovereignty, they will
                                    individually or collectively take such further steps for the
                                    defense of the New World as may in each instance seem to them
                                    desirable and practicable.”</p>

                        <p>Please ask Dr. Guani to regard this draft as confidential and as
                            preliminary and say that I shall be most grateful if he would let me

                        <p>3. Both the British Embassy and ourselves are of the opinion that
                            measures taken by Argentine port authorities to prevent acts of sabotage
                            leave much to be desired due largely to inadequate number of
                            surveillance personnel, the authorities themselves stating that funds
                            appropriated by the Congress for this purpose are insufficient. It is
                            our belief that this situation might be corrected if action could be
                            taken at the Rio de Janeiro Conference to ensure adoption of adequate
                            anti-sabotage measures by all of the American Republics.<note n="26"

                            Axis powers which this Government hopes will be unanimously adopted at
                            the Rio de Janeiro Conference. The Ambassador has informed me that his
                            Government will of course be wholly in accord with this resolution.</p>
                        <p>It is my further belief that this resolution will be supported, in
                            addition to the 10 Republics which have declared war and the 3 Republics
                            which have already broken all relations, by the Governments of Brazil,
                            Uruguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru. It is my further belief that
                            Paraguay will support any position which may be taken by Brazil.</p>
                        <p>I am as yet uncertain of the position which will be taken by Chile and it
                            is my understanding that the Chilean Government, being fearful of its
                            long and relatively unprotected coastline, may hesitate against taking
                            any action against the Axis powers unless all of the other American
                            Republics insist that such action as that above indicated be unanimously
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the position of Argentina, I am as yet uncertain. As you
                            know, the Argentine people in their vast majority seem to be strongly
                            opposed to the hesitant course so far followed by their Government. I am
                            inclined to believe however that Argentina will not permit herself to be
                            placed in a minority of one at the meeting, even on an issue of this
                            fundamental character.</p>
                        <p>It may be wiser for you to speak directly with President Santos with
                            regard to the above than with the Foreign Minister.<note n="30"

                        <p>7. For the Under Secretary. Minister of Foreign Affairs tells me that his
                            reports indicate Argentine resistance to strong action at Rio de Janeiro
                            Conference and increasing Chilean uneasiness about going the whole way.
                            He asserts, however, that he will cooperate with the United States
                            thoroughly at the meeting and will support <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15"
                                facs="0027"/>any decisions which the bulk of the American Republics
                            may reach. While Bolivian cooperation has been so far purely lip
                            service, I feel that if Rio de Janeiro meeting defines situation we can
                            by tactful pressure probably secure action particularly in controlling
                            German interests in Bolivia.</p>

                            a concise resolution by all the Republics to break relations. He added
                            that the Colombian delegation would wish to help us in every way at

                            of Italy in order to use it at Rio as an estoppel to her agreeing to

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to submit the following
                            observations with regard to the general attitude and position which the
                            Argentine Delegation may be expected to take at the Rio de Janeiro
                            Conference. These observations are based upon conversations with various
                            Argentines, in and out of the Government, as well as officers of the
                            Army and Navy and certain of my diplomatic colleagues.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Political</hi></p>
                        <p>Unless some important event should occur in the meantime to change the
                            international situation, it appears virtually certain that the Argentine
                            Government will not agree at Rio de Janeiro to consider declaring war on
                            the Axis Powers. The suggestion to that effect already communicated to
                            the Government here by the Dominican Republic has not been favorably
                            considered and while so far as can be learned no official reply has been
                            given, from talks with the Foreign Minister and other officials it seems
                            clear that the Government is not disposed to go to such lengths. This
                            was made clear to the Brazilian Ambassador, Dr. Rodrigues Alves, in a
                            talk he had with the Foreign Minister just before the former left for
                            Rio de Janeiro to take over his duties as Secretary General of the
                            Conference (see Embassy’s telegram No. 1573, of December 28 [<hi

                            probably apply so far as the breaking off of diplomatic relations with
                            the Axis Powers although being a less drastic step, this is not so
                            certain. The fact that the recall of the German Ambassador<note n="39"
                                xml:id="d21fn39">Baron Edmund von Thermann.</note> by his Government
                            has been definitely announced as well as the withdrawal of the Argentine
                            Ambassador in Berlin,<note n="40" xml:id="d21fn40">Ricardo
                                Olivera.</note> and the efforts which will be made by influential
                            Argentines <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0029"/>to prevent successors
                            to the above being appointed might possibly result in a situation
                            somewhat similar to that in our own relations with Germany prior to the
                            state of war, with Chargés d’ Affaires in charge of both missions, but
                            for the present at least, it seems doubtful whether the Government here
                            would permit matters to proceed beyond this point. In considering both
                            the question of declaration of war and severance of diplomatic
                            relations, it is necessary to remember that so far as Argentina is
                            concerned, a distinction must be drawn between the three principal Axis
                            Powers. A declaration of war against Japan would be far easier to
                            envisage than against Germany, and particularly Italy. As the Under
                            Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Gache, remarked cynically in a burst
                            of frankness, when I expressed some concern that Dr. Ruiz Guiñazú seemed
                            more hesitant in agreeing to the decree declaring the United States
                            would not be regarded as a belligerent following the declaration of war
                            by Germany and Italy than he had been in the case of Japan: “You must
                            remember that there are virtually no Japanese in the country; but there
                            are many Germans and more Italians: that, to a politician, is
                            important.”</p>
                        <p>The clearest and most objective presentation of Argentina’s position that
                            I have yet had came from Rear Admiral Gonzalo D. Bustamante, at present
                            in command of the River Squadron, in a recent talk when we discussed the
                            coming conference at Rio de Janeiro. His thesis was roughly as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>First and most important of all, it must be remembered that the vital
                            interests of our country call for the closest cooperation with the
                            United States. That is the point from which any discussion of our
                            foreign policy must begin. Aside from commitments formally taken,
                            ideologically, geographically, economically and from the naval and
                            military standpoint, we are bound to the United States. No other
                            position is conceivable. Admitting this, as all serious Argentines must,
                            let us consider our position at Rio de Janeiro. I do not believe that it
                            is to your or to our interest that Argentina should declare war against
                            the Axis Powers. We are not, certainly, at this time, in a position to
                            defend ourselves if attacked. Should Brazil and Argentina declare war,
                            the Axis Powers might well attempt to make an example of us. In such a
                            case, could we count on assistance from the United States and Great
                            Britain? If you attempted to help us, as we feel sure you would, it
                            would mean further extension of your lines. Also do not forget that one
                            fifth of our population is of “Totalitarian” origin, principally
                            Italian. While many of the Italians are at present not Fascists,
                            declared war against the country of their origin or of their parents
                            would present them with a clear cut issue. Sabotage in many industries
                            and fields of production <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0030"
                            />essential to the United States might well take place. Argentina’s best
                            role for the present, I feel, is to patrol its coastal waters, to
                            prevent enemy activities from gaining foothold on our coasts or
                            operation within our waters; clean house within the country by putting
                            an end to fifth column and subversive activities and cooperate fully
                            with you in making available all supplies you need, repairing your ships
                            if damaged on convoy or in enemy engagements, etc.</p>
                        <p>“What about breaking off diplomatic relations,” I asked. “This would
                            eliminate the heads of subversive movements and stop communications now
                            made possible through diplomatic immunity?”</p>
                        <p>“We must weigh the advantages against the disadvantages,” he replied. “I
                            still feel that the advantages to be gained by such a step would not
                            compensate for the disadvantages I have mentioned.”</p>
                        <p>I asked him about convoy: whether it was not logical that, with our
                            country making every effort to keep Argentina supplied with necessities,
                            even at a sacrifice to our own people, they should at least assume part
                            of the burden of convoy, should this step be found necessary. He
                            hesitated. “For the moment” he said, “let us use our ships for patrol
                            purposes. Convoy is the first step to war, and again I do not feel we
                            are ready.”</p>
                        <p>Admiral Bustamante, who has spent much time in the United States and is
                            married to an American, represents the element in the navy more
                            favorably disposed to the United States. Our Naval Attaché<note n="41"
                                xml:id="d21fn41">Capt. William D. Brereton, Jr.</note> informs me
                            that he is generally considered to have the best mind among the higher
                            naval officers. With Admirals Guisasola, Stewart, Zar, and certain
                            others, Bustamante can, I feel, be considered to favor cooperation with
                            us within the limits set forth.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, Dr. Gancedo,<note n="42" xml:id="d21fn42">Deputy from
                                the Province of Santiago del Estero in the Argentine Chamber of

                            us, informs me that he has had frank talks with the Acting
                                President,<note n="43" xml:id="d21fn43">Ramón S. Castillo.</note>
                            with General Justo,<note n="44" xml:id="d21fn44">Gen. Agustin P. Justo,
                                former President and Minister of War.</note> and with the Foreign
                            Minister, and that the Government is prepared to convoy its own vessels.
                            Furthermore he thinks that, if pressed, they might agree to participate
                            in convoying United States ships carrying Argentine goods as far as
                            Brazilian territorial waters, where Brazilian ships could then take up
                            the escort. While he avoided the question of declaration of war or
                            official severance of diplomatic relations, he believes that in all
                            other matters we can count on Argentina’s support at Rio de Janeiro. He
                            assures me that in all his talks he has insisted that at the forthcoming
                            conference at Rio Argentina must take the <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19"
                                facs="0031"/>lead in declaring full solidarity with the United
                            States. He it was who told me he hopes with Justo’s support to prevent
                            the appointment of a successor to Olivera, recently recalled from
                            Berlin, and who is slated for another post. He is also working to the
                            end that a successor to von Thermann shall not be accepted by the
                            Argentine Government. Dr. Gancedo also informed me that Candioti<note

                            post of Ambassador in Japan will be left unfilled. He … is planning to
                            be in Buenos Aires during the conference and assures me that should the
                            Argentine delegation at Rio not be disposed to cooperate he will be glad
                            to use his influence with the Acting President, which is considerable,
                            and with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Rothe, his closest
                            friend in the cabinet.</p>
                        <p>So far as concerns Argentina’s part in continental defense measures, it
                            is presumed that the plan taken to Washington by the Argentine
                            Military-Naval Mission<note n="46" xml:id="d21fn46">See correspondence
                                between the United States and Argentina concerning defense, <ref
                                    target="#pg_371">pp. 371</ref> ff.</note> is now known to the
                            Department. While I am not myself familiar with the plan, the Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs intimated that it is very comprehensive and
                            envisages cooperation particularly as regards naval defense, with the
                            east coast republics, particularly Brazil and Uruguay, as well as with
                            Chile in defense of the Straits. (The Argentine plan was drawn up
                            presumably prior to the initiating by Chile of negotiations to amend the
                            treaty of 1881<note n="47" xml:id="d21fn47">For English version of

                            fortification of the Straits for the duration of the war.) The fact that
                            our delegation does not include Naval or Military experts presumably
                            indicates that we do not envisage at Rio discussions regarding the
                            technical aspects of defense against external aggression.</p>
                        <p>So far as concerns measures to curb alien activities within the country,
                            this is certainly a point on which a clear understanding with Argentina
                            will have to be reached. Under declarations VI and VII of Habana,<note

                                    >Bulletin</hi>, August 24, 1940, p. 132.</note> Argentina is
                            committed to take the necessary steps to prevent such activities. This,
                            as the Department is aware, the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, through
                            its Investigating Committee, has attempted to do, and so far as the work
                            of the Committee itself was concerned, it performed a very satisfactory
                            and thorough job.</p>
                        <p>From the outset, however, it received no assistance or cooperation from
                            the Government. On the contrary, the Committee found itself continually
                            blocked and hampered in its efforts, particularly by the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs. Without discussing the reasons for this, which lie
                            largely in the personality of the Foreign Minister and <pb n="20"

                            clear understanding is reached in Rio de Janeiro, the Government here
                            will adopt the same attitude and obstructionist tactics in the future.
                            As the Embassy has reported, the “State of Siege” widely heralded as
                            designed to implement Argentina’s commitments taken at Habana,
                            particularly as regards not considering the United States as a
                            belligerent, has thus far had little effect other than to prevent the 95
                            percent pro-democratic press and public from presenting or making known
                            their viewpoint without, so far as can be seen, seriously hampering the
                            subversive activities and insidious propaganda of the Axis Powers. It
                            would seem clearly indicated that the declarations of Habana dealing
                            with subversive activities<note n="49" xml:id="d21fn49">Resolutions VI
                                and VII.</note> should be re-discussed and interpreted so clearly
                            and unequivocally as to leave no possible room for doubt as to what are
                            the duties assumed by each of the Republics in this respect. (The
                            negligent attitude of the Argentine Government in permitting the escape

                            commitments taken at Habana, the Argentine Government’s responsibilities
                            under Neutrality required the internment or close supervision of these

                            allies of American belligerents) of their aims in the war, this might be
                            a means of preventing the continuance of the present state of affairs in

                            compiled from the data contained in the Department’s telegram No. 1148

                            given to Raúl Prebisch, General Manager of the Central Bank.</p>
                        <p>The only action which the Argentine Government or the Central Bank has
                            thus far taken to curb financial transactions for the benefit of the
                            Axis countries has consisted of two circulars issued by the Central Bank
                            and dated December 11 and 22 (Nos. 262 and 264), respectively. The first
                            of these, which was issued at the direction of the Ministry of Finance,
                            provides for an embargo on transfers of funds to and from Japan and
                            “freezes” accounts of funds and securities in Argentina of persons or
                            firms domiciled in Japan (as well as prohibits deposits in such
                            accounts), although operations may be conducted if expressly authorized
                            by the Central Bank. The circular of December 22 purports to render more
                            difficult the extensive practice of making transfers to certain
                            countries of Europe and the Far East through Switzerland and other third
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>A factor in this entire situation, of course, is that before the United
                            States entered the war, the Central Bank had already been given a
                            substantial control over transfers of payment to Europe and the Far
                            East. The measures providing such control, as well as the circulars of
                            December 11 and 22, were reported in the Embassy’s despatches nos. 3744
                            of December 24, 1941 and 3752 of December 26, 1941.<note n="54"

                        <p>How much further the Argentine authorities will be disposed to go in
                            curbing economic and financial activities of the Axis countries is
                            difficult to say. An impression prevails that the Central Bank and
                            perhaps certain persons within the Government would be willing to go at
                            least some distance further in meeting our desiderata but that Dr. Ruiz
                            Guiñazú is the retarding influence. It is to be recognized, however,
                            that the large number of Italian and German nationals in Argentina
                            present real difficulties in the formulation of <pb n="22"
                                xml:id="pg_22" facs="0034"/>any measures that would pertain to
                            internal transactions of those nationals and their business
                            enterprises.</p>
                        <p>As to external transactions, the Embassy has continuously emphasized in
                            conversations on the subject with the Argentine authorities that even
                            though the Central Bank already has considerable control over such
                            transactions, a clear-cut measure at this time that would apply
                            specifically to Germany and Italy (as the measure of December 11 refers
                            specifically to Japan) would have a good psychological effect, and has
                            implied that the absence of such a measure is having a correspondingly
                            bad effect.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has also emphasized in these conversations that the prompt
                            adoption of a measure of this kind could be calculated to produce a
                            better impression abroad than would be the case if no such steps were
                            taken before the taking of collective action at the conference at Rio de
                            Janeiro.</p>
                        <p>As of possible interest to the Department, I am enclosing a
                                memorandum<note n="55" xml:id="d21fn55">Not printed.</note> based on

                        <p>23. From the Under Secretary. The prime objective of this Government at
                            the Rio Conference would be to obtain a joint declaration of all the
                            American Republics that they feel it necessary to sever all relations
                            with the Axis powers.</p>
                        <p>It seems inconceivable in view of existing inter-American agreements, in
                            view of the pledges of solidarity recently given and in view of the fact
                            that 10 American Republics are now at war because of acts of aggression
                            committed against one of them, that the territory of other American
                            republics can continue to be used by agents diplomatic and consular of
                            the Axis powers when the prime purpose of these agents is to instigate
                            subversive movements, to report to their governments upon the defense
                            measures and preparations of all of the American republics, to report
                            upon the movements of American or Allied ships so that these may be sunk
                            at sea, and to create a never ending threat to the security of the
                            nations engaged in war. It seems therefore in simple terms that the
                            action proposed would be the minimum required on the part of the
                            Republics which have not broken relations if the term solidarity is to
                            be anything other than an empty phrase.</p>
                        <p>For your strictly confidential and personal information I have received
                            assurances so far from all of the Republics except Chile and Argentina
                            that they will support the United States in this objective.</p>
                        <p>I have received word this morning from Aranha that he has come to the
                            conclusion that it would be expedient for this Government to submit the
                            following draft resolution to the Argentine Foreign Minister through you
                            for the latter’s information.</p>

                        <p>24. From the Under Secretary. Espil yesterday called upon me by
                            instruction of his Government and gave me the oral message from his
                            Foreign Minister which follows.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">

                            <p>We have learned of the signing in Washington of the pact of alliance
                                of twenty-six countries of all continents to fight against the

                                nations who, without previous consultation, had already individually
                                declared war and which now are entering into an alliance with
                                non-continental nations which would not seem to be in accord with
                                existing commitments, in particular the Declaration of Lima of 1938
                                and other inter-American peace agreements.</p>
                            <p>This omission exceeds any regional concept and approaches an almost
                                universal position and in fact raises doubts as to the utility of
                                any consultation in Rio de Janeiro. There is a certain contradiction
                                in inviting us to participate in the study and adoption of measures
                                of common defense at the same time that nine countries proceed
                                without prior exchange of views in defining in absolute form their
                                double position, intracontinental and extracontinental, with the
                                consequent risks and responsibilities of a state of war.</p>
                            <p>The Argentine Foreign Office could not keep silent with regard to
                                this impression since it is its intention to join in loyal
                                application of the consultative system. It believes that a
                                reservation is imperative in view of that decision, all the more
                                because the pact of alliance remains open for the adherence of other
                                countries, [not?] necessarily American. For any nation jealous of
                                its sovereignty, the procedure which has been observed is
                                objectionable in as much as consultation is undertaken subsequent to
                                the resolution adopted. The system of consultation has as its object
                                the seeking of directives <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0037"/>by
                                means of the coordination of wills. In the international order,
                                every state retains its sovereign power and international solidarity
                                can only be admitted through free determination contemplating the
                                gravity of existing facts and their consequences within the unity of
                                views regarding continental defense.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, this situation is complicated in view of Article 20 of the
                                new Regulations for the Consultative Meeting,<note n="60"

                                pact of alliance, thus changing completely the exclusively American
                                concept of solidarity.</p>

                                apprehension with which this Government views this deviation from

                                original agreements of Buenos Aires.</p>
                            <p>In taking this step, the Argentine Government desires to insure, free
                                from any erroneous interpretations, the conception with which it
                                will accord the Consultative Meeting at Rio de Janeiro in accordance
                                with the continental commitments which it has undertaken and whose
                                application, through the system of consultation, it desires to see
                                duly discussed and agreed upon in Rio de Janeiro.”</p>

                        <p>8. I had interviews yesterday, among others, with the Ministers for
                            Foreign Affairs of Peru, Paraguay and Bolivia. All three delegations
                            will support a declaration for the rupture of relations with the
                                Axis<note n="62" xml:id="d26fn62">In his address at the opening
                                session of the Conference, Under Secretary of State Welles
                                emphasized the danger to the American Republics which lay in the
                                ability of Axis Embassies and Consulates to communicate war
                                information to their home offices. For text of address, see

                            obviously lacking in enthusiasm.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Ministers of all of the Caribbean, Central American and
                            northern South American Republics are vehemently of the opinion that the
                            destiny of the hemisphere should not be determined by the veto power
                            which the Argentine Government apparently desires to exercise. This
                            tendency, of which you personally saw so much at the Lima Conference, is
                            stronger today and is I think uncontrollable.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean, Uruguayan and Argentine Foreign Ministers arrived this
                            morning. Aranha is still of the opinion that Argentina can be brought
                            into line but from the public statements already made by Dr. Ruiz
                            Guiñazú and from the intemperate declarations he has made to the
                            Peruvian and Paraguayan Foreign Ministers, of which they informed me
                            yesterday, I am decidedly less optimistic in this regard than
                            Aranha.</p>
                        <p>Aranha is making every effort to force an immediate agreement for the
                            settlement of the Peru-Ecuador boundary dispute.<note n="63"
                                xml:id="d26fn63">Concerning this dispute, see bracketed note, <ref

                            he and I met yesterday with the Peruvian Foreign Minister, the latter
                            indicated that his Government was now willing to agree to a far more
                            equitable and generous settlement than Peru had up to now given any
                            indication that she would be willing to accept. The Ecuadoran delegation
                            has informed me that it will not attend the sessions of the conference
                            unless an agreement, at least in principle, is found before the opening
                            session tomorrow.</p>

                            <p>For Under Secretary Welles. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                has made it clear to me that the Argentine Government will not agree
                                to break relations with any of the Axis Powers, using the same old
                                arguments—their lack of military and naval defense which makes it
                                impossible to take what he described as “any pre-belligerent action”
                                that might subject them to attack by the Axis Powers. (The Acting
                                President made the same statement to my deputy friend, adding
                                confidentially that both army and navy are opposed to a break.) With
                                this exception Rothe insists that they are prepared to follow the
                                United States and other American Republics in all measures of a
                                political and economic nature including prevention of Axis
                                propaganda and subversive activities, furnishing us with essential
                                materials and facilities of their port for our naval vessels,
                                repairs, fueling, et cetera.</p>
                            <p>I assume it is still our prime objective at the Conference to obtain
                                a joint declaration of all American Republics severing relations. In
                                this case, I believe the strongest argument we could use with
                                Argentina would be that any country which refused to join in the
                                resolution cannot expect the same assistance from United States in
                                essential defense material and other necessary products as those who
                                have broken relations and consequently, according to Argentina’s own
                                thesis, subjected themselves to danger of attack.</p>
                            <p>I am informed that Castillo feels reasonably certain that Argentina
                                can count on one or more countries siding with them in refusing to
                                join in resolution. If they find all other countries support
                                resolution this will have telling effect since, no matter what they
                                say, they genuinely fear isolation and its inevitable consequences
                                for them externally and internally.</p>

                        <p>15. The situation remains approximately the same as indicated in my last
                            telegram.</p>
                        <p>As you know, I completely share your own feeling that every effort should
                            be made to preserve unanimity, but that if the Argentine Government is
                            unwilling to join in a continental declaration for a severance of
                            relations with the Axis Powers, Argentina should be allowed to proceed
                            alone.</p>

                        <p>I had a very frank talk yesterday morning with Dr. Ruiz Guiñazú. I found
                            him wavering and vacillating, and obviously very much under the
                            impression of the strong line taken by the other delegations and by the
                            general state of public opinion in Brazil. Without making any
                            commitment, he gave me to understand that he was inclined to go along
                            with a declaration for the severance of relations, but he stated he
                            would first have to cable President Castillo and get new
                            instructions.</p>
                        <p>President Vargas<note n="64" xml:id="d28fn64">Getulio Vargas, President
                                of Brazil.</note> told me yesterday afternoon that the Argentines
                            would come along and that he himself had personally made it absolutely
                            clear to Ruiz Guiñazú that Brazil would support the United States 100%;
                            that the final decision of Brazil in this regard had been reached, and
                            that he, Vargas, had the support of practically every citizen of Brazil
                            in following this policy.</p>

                                Colombia,<note n="67" xml:id="d28fn67">Gabriel Turbay.</note> are
                            today jointly presenting to the committee a project for the severance of
                            relations with the Axis Powers. They have been to see Ruiz Guiñazú, and
                            have shown him the project. They have told him that they will not agree
                            to a compromise and that they will under no conditions recede from the
                            position they have taken, and that in this position they have the
                            support of every nation of the hemisphere, except Chile and
                            Argentina.</p>
                        <p>The speech made yesterday by Dr. Guani was decidedly helpful as an
                            indication to the rest of the Continent that Argentina’s assumed control
                            over the smaller republics of South America is nonexistent.</p>
                        <p>The general atmosphere of the Conference could not be more favorable from
                            our standpoint. I am now beginning to believe that the Argentine
                            Government may decide to come along largely because of the firm attitude
                            taken by President Vargas and Aranha. … Aranha feels and I agree,
                            however, that if Argentina is brought into line Chile will be forced
                            without question to adhere to any joint declaration.</p>

                        <p>27. I have now had three very long conversations with the Argentine
                            Foreign Minister. I have made all of the obvious arguments in favor of
                            unity but I have likewise made it clear that my Government like almost
                            every other government of the American Republics believes that the
                            continued presence of Axis representatives on the territory of the
                            American Republics is a fundamental danger to the security of those
                            republics which are at war and to the capacity of the other American
                            Republics for effective self-defense. I made it very clear that in my
                            judgment the issue is one regarding which no compromise can be found
                            although, of course, I as well as the other chiefs of delegations will
                            make every effort to find some phraseology acceptable to all, provided
                            the necessary principles are maintained intact.</p>
                        <p>In a conversation which I had with Dr. Ruiz Guiñazú the night before last
                            he maintained that Argentina would be willing to break relations with
                            the Axis Powers in April but that because of the fact that congressional
                            elections are scheduled to take place in Argentina in March the raising
                            of this issue at the present moment in Argentina would create
                            insuperable political difficulties for the Government which intends in
                            any way that may be necessary to see that the outcome of these elections
                            is satisfactory to it from the political standpoint.</p>
                        <p>He has raised the same issue in his conversations with President
                            Vargas.</p>
                        <p>Until yesterday he was alleging that Peru, Chile and Paraguay would
                            support the Argentine position of opposition to a joint declaration
                            breaking relations. I had arrangements made, however, to have him
                            informed by a source in which he has confidence that the President of
                                Peru<note n="72" xml:id="d30fn72">Manuel Prado Ugarteche.</note>
                            only yesterday gave categorical instructions to his delegation to
                            support our position and that the Paraguayan Foreign Minister had
                            received final instructions to support Brazil and the United States. At
                            the same time the Chilean Foreign Minister came to see me and told me
                            that notwithstanding instructions he <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31"
                                facs="0043"/>had originally received against the severance of
                            relations, he was now personally convinced that the step should be taken
                            and he had sent the most urgent messages to Santiago requesting full
                            authority to join in the proposed declaration. At midnight last night he
                            told me that he expected to receive satisfactory instructions today.</p>
                        <p>All of these facts have created a state of panic in the mind of Dr. Ruiz
                            Guiñazú. He now sees Argentina completely isolated but whether, as he
                            tells me, he has urged Acting President Castillo to change the orders or
                            not, the position taken by the Acting President of Argentina appears to
                            be consistently obstinate with regard to the issue of the severance of
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>After his interview with President Vargas last night Dr. Ruiz Guiñazú
                            came unannounced to see me to tell me that the Argentine Government was
                            willing to take the following steps: <list>

                                    which felt it impossible to take the action contemplated by the
                                    proposed joint declaration immediately would be able later to
                                    adhere thereto. In this way he said Argentina could take the

                        <p>I have told Dr. Ruiz Guiñazú that I responded sincerely to his desire to
                            adopt a course which would promote unity and avoid the tragic impression
                            at this time that the unity of the hemisphere had been broken. I said,
                            however, that I did not see that the steps which he contemplated
                            provided any solution. I said that the mere fact that Argentina would
                            refrain from signing the proposed declaration for the severance of
                            relations with the Axis Powers could only be interpreted as
                            demonstrating Argentina’s unwillingness to join in measures believed
                            essential for the defense of the hemisphere by the other 20 American
                            Republics. With regard to the specific project which he had handed me
                            and which he emphasized should be regarded as supplementary to the
                            proposed declaration for the severance of relations I said I would give
                            the matter the most attentive study and discuss it with other chiefs of
                            delegation but that it was my firm belief that it constituted a
                            retrogression and was highly unsatisfactory.</p>

                        <p>I have studiously avoided in my conversations with him any syllable which
                            could be used by him as a complaint that the United States was bringing
                            economic or financial pressure upon Argentina. I have, however, asked
                            some of the advisers in the delegation in talking with Prebisch and
                                Irgoyen<note n="73" xml:id="d30fn73">Presumably Alonzo Irigoyen,
                                Argentine Under Secretary of Finance.</note> to continue to make it
                            clear as from me that at a time like this the economic and financial
                            assistance which the United States can give the other American Republics
                            will necessarily be given only to those nations which are
                            whole-heartedly and effectively cooperating with us in the defense of
                            the hemisphere. All of the necessary effect in this regard has
                            consequently undoubtedly already been created.</p>

                        <p>41. As the Department has undoubtedly been informed by Ambassador Armour
                            the Acting President of Argentina this morning refused to approve the
                            agreement reached with his Foreign Minister <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34"
                                facs="0046"/>last night upon the text of a joint declaration for the
                            breaking of relations.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Ruiz Guiñazú informed all of us yesterday evening that he was fully
                            authorized to reach this agreement. He is now disauthorized by his own
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>He has this afternoon communicated by telephone with Buenos Aires urging
                            approval by Castillo of a slightly modified text for article III of the
                            proposed joint declaration.</p>
                        <p>The Acting President of Chile has informed Aranha that the Chilean
                            Foreign Minister has received precise instructions permitting him to
                            sign the joint declaration.</p>
                        <p>A decision was reached this afternoon by all of the other Foreign
                            Ministers that a plenary session would be held tomorrow afternoon at
                            which all of the Foreign Ministers would sign the joint declaration for
                            the breaking of relations. If Argentina is not prepared to go along the
                            others at that time will go along without her.</p>
                        <p>The very definite conclusion has been reached by all of the Foreign
                            Ministers with whom I have spoken that some influence of an extra
                            continental character is responsible for the decision reached by Dr.
                            Castillo. The entire Argentine delegation now without exception is
                            vehemently of the opinion that the Argentine Government should support
                            the joint declaration as agreed upon last night.</p>

                        <p>45. After an all day debate in committee in which feelings ran
                            exceedingly high and in the course of which I stated that I felt that
                                <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0047"/>unless a satisfactory
                            agreement on the rupture of relations could be reached today the meeting
                            of Foreign Ministers must publicly confess its complete incapacity to
                            confront the vital issues of the moment a draft formula was agreed upon
                            late this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>The text transmitted to the Department in my telegram no. 39, January 22,
                            9 a.m., is retained insofar as articles 1, 2, and 4 are concerned,
                            except that in article 2 the word “mutual” is replaced with the word
                            “reciprocal” and in article 4 the final phrase reads “may have a
                            solidary character” instead of the explanation “collective and
                            solidary”.</p>
                        <p>Article 3 which, of course, has been the crux of the debate in its
                            present form reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The American Republics consequently, following the procedure
                                    established by their own laws within the position and
                                    circumstances of each country in the actual continental
                                    conflict, recommend the rupture of their diplomatic relations
                                    with Japan, Germany, and Italy, since the first of these states
                                    has attacked and the other two have declared war upon an
                                    American country.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The interpretation to be given to the phrase “within the position and
                            circumstances of each country in the actual continental conflict” refers
                            to whether a country is ready [<hi rend="italic">already</hi>] at war or
                            has already broken relations.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as Argentina by means of this official declaration now joins
                            with Chile and the other American Republics recommending that all of
                            them break diplomatic relations with the Axis Powers the concrete effect
                            is exactly the same as that which would have resulted in the text agreed
                            upon on January 21.</p>
                        <p>At a formal session of the Political Committee this evening all of the 21
                            Foreign Ministers publicly voted for the project in the form now
                            communicated to the Department.</p>
                        <p>The Uruguayan Foreign Minister publicly stated at this session of the
                            Committee that he expected to be able to inform the conference tomorrow
                            that Uruguay had already broken relations with the Axis Powers. The
                            Peruvian Foreign Minister has informed me that his Government will
                            likewise take action immediately and so have the Bolivian and Paraguayan
                            Foreign Ministers.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean Foreign Minister came to see me this afternoon to inform me
                            that he himself would break relations with the Axis Powers before the
                            expiration of the term of office of the present Government. I have
                            already fully reported the attitude of Brazil in this regard.</p>

                        <p>47. I told the press this morning for guidance that our objectives here
                            were twofold, namely, to obtain the breaking off diplomatic relations
                            and to prevent the breaking of hemisphere unity. I explained that if
                            Argentina and Chile had gone their separate ways, Germany could have
                            called it a great victory. This also would have put Brazil in a
                            difficult position because two of her largest neighbors would have
                            become centers for Axis activities. Obviously, some compromise was
                            necessary. Under the resolution approved yesterday Argentina and Chile
                            have recommended to themselves that relations be broken and they have
                            for the first time admitted that there is a continental conflict. The
                            phraseology of any resolution is meaningless unless its spirit is
                            fulfilled. Several of the countries have already stated that they would
                            immediately break relations including Uruguay, Peru and Brazil.
                            Furthermore, the very strong resolution on the breaking of financial and
                            commercial relations which it is expected will be adopted this morning
                            with a minor reservation by Argentina will be a further practical
                            implementation of yesterday’s recommendation to break diplomatic
                            relations.</p>

                            American Republics which had not yet taken such action, and likewise the
                            making of every effort to prevent the breakdown of the unity of the
                            hemisphere for the creation of which your own Administration is solely
                            responsible.</p>
                        <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0049"/>
                        <p>During the nearly 2 weeks that I have been here I have worked night and
                            day to attain these objectives. As you remember, an agreement was
                            reached with the Argentine Foreign Minister on January 21 upon the text
                            of a joint declaration for the breaking of relations which contained
                            four articles. The full text as then agreed upon reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows text of draft resolution quoted in telegram No. 39, January
                            22, 9 a.m., from Mr. Welles, <ref target="#pg_32">page 32</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>As a result of the unwillingness of the Acting President of Argentina to
                            confirm the agreement previously reached by the Argentine Foreign
                            Minister on January 21 and which agreement the latter had informed us
                            all he was fully authorized to make, the Conference was thrown into a
                            state verging upon chaos on January 22 and 23.</p>
                        <p>During that period both President Vargas and Aranha told me of their
                            tremendous concern at the possibility of a rupture between Brazil and
                            Argentina in view of the fact that Brazil’s traditional friendship with
                            Chile, as a counterpoise to Argentina, had practically vanished as a
                            result of the dubious character of the present Government of Chile. They
                            reaffirmed their decision to go one hundred percent with the United
                            States, but they urged that if possible Brazil should not be forced to
                            take an open attitude of antagonism to Argentina. Exactly the same pleas
                            were made to me by the Uruguayan and Bolivian Foreign Ministers. The
                            joint opinion of all of them was that if Argentina and Chile now broke
                            with the other American Republics, it would be primarily Brazil, Uruguay
                            and Bolivia that would suffer. If a rupture took place in the American
                            family of nations, Argentina and Chile would become the <hi
                                rend="italic">foci</hi> of Axis agents and of subversive activities
                            directed primarily against neighboring countries with the very great
                            probability that the Brazilian Army would view such a situation with the
                            utmost alarm and probable unrest on account of its belief that the
                            Argentine Army is dominated to a considerable extent by German
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>It seemed to me, therefore, in the highest interest of our own country,
                            that I should make every effort to preserve unity and yet at the same
                            time achieve the objectives upon which you and I agreed.</p>
                        <p>In my telegram No. 45, January 23, 11 p.m., I reported to the Secretary
                            of State the events of yesterday and the exact text of the agreement for
                            the rupture of relations as finally approved unanimously by all of the
                            Foreign Ministers. You will see from this telegram that articles 1, 2,
                            and 4 are practically left unchanged except for a slight strengthening
                            of the phraseology employed in article 2.</p>
                        <p>The only other remaining article, No. 3 reads as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The American Republics consequently, following the procedure

                                    conflict, recommend the <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0050"
                                    />rupture of their diplomatic relations with Japan, Germany and
                                    Italy since the first of these states has attacked and the other
                                    two have declared war upon an American country.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In this article for the first time, notwithstanding recent earlier
                            official declarations to the contrary by the Acting President of
                            Argentina and by the Chilean Government, both Argentina and Chile
                            publicly go on record as recommending to all of the American Republics,
                            including themselves, the breaking of diplomatic relations with the Axis
                            Powers. In addition to that, the reason for such action is specifically
                            declared to be the attack upon the United States, and finally, the
                            conflict involving the Americas has now for the first time officially
                            been declared to be “continental.” In the considered judgment of Aranha,
                            of the Foreign Minister of Mexico, of the Foreign Minister of Peru, of
                            the Foreign Minister of Venezuela, and of the chiefs of delegation of
                            Colombia, Cuba, and Bolivia, this text is stronger, more satisfactory,
                            and has less reservations and weasel words than the text agreed upon on
                            January 21.</p>
                        <p>This fundamental issue has consequently been raised: would it have been
                            better for 19 Republics, including the United States, to announce that
                            the American Republics “should not continue” diplomatic relations with
                            the Axis Powers, in the full knowledge that the united American front
                            would thereby be broken and that Argentina and Chile would in all
                            likelihood become hotbeds for Axis activities; or for the United States
                            in conjunction with every other American Republic to agree upon the text
                            set forth above by which all of the American Republics jointly recommend
                            the severance of their diplomatic relations with the Axis Powers.</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian press, which is not today controlled, has unanimously
                            proclaimed the agreement reached as a triumph. Every delegate and
                            Foreign Minister with whom I have spoken last night and this morning
                            likewise shares this point of view. If the United States had taken the
                            opposite course and Argentina and Chile had finally been forced out of
                            the united line-up, before this Conference had terminated the United
                            States would have been attacked from one end of the continent to the
                            other for having broken the united American front and for having through
                            undue pressure tried to force its own views upon Argentina and Chile in
                            order to save American skins. I think you will likewise agree that
                            nothing would have given greater satisfaction to the Axis Powers
                            themselves than to be able to announce to the rest of the world that
                            they had succeeded in breaking up the solidarity of the American
                            Republics.</p>
                        <p>I fully share the point of view you yourself expressed to me last night
                            and that is that immediate implementation in the sense of action is
                            required in order to counteract the alleged mistaken press comments
                            which have been reported, Aranha has authorized me <pb n="39"
                                xml:id="pg_39" facs="0051"/>specifically to state to you by
                            authorization of President Vargas that at the close of the session of
                            the Conference on the afternoon of Monday, January 26, he will announce
                            in the name of the Government of Brazil the severance of relations
                            between Brazil and the Axis Powers. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of
                            Uruguay who had intended to make that announcement today has decided
                            likewise to withhold the announcement of Uruguayan rupture of relations
                            until the closing session of the Conference because of the increased
                            effect that such an announcement would have there.</p>
                        <p>[The representative from] Paraguay has just informed me he has requested
                            similar instructions. Both Ecuador and Bolivia with full authorization
                            have given me assurances to the same effect.</p>
                        <p>May I say to you again how deeply grateful I am for what you said last
                                night.<note n="76" xml:id="d38fn76">According to Secretary Hull’s
                                account in his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>, the President
                                interrupted the conversation between the Secretary and the Under
                                Secretary to state that a decision had been made, and that, with the
                                Conference in the act of adjourning, reconsideration was not
                                feasible.</note> In full accord with the policy you approved, what
                            we have achieved, in my personal judgment, is a result which is the
                            safest for the interests of our own country. I have kept the Secretary
                            of State fully informed as a review of the telegrams I have sent him
                            since my arrival in Rio will demonstrate. It has been manifestly
                            impossible for me in the kind of constant turmoil and continuous
                            conferences which a meeting of this kind inevitably implies, to request
                            prior authorization for agreeing to every word. I took it for granted
                            that so long as the desired objectives were attained and so long as the
                            policy you and the Secretary of State had approved was carried out, I
                            was entitled to have sufficient confidence from the Secretary of State
                            to make it possible for me within those bounds to agree upon texts.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I am glad to add that at this morning’s session the text of
                            the resolution for the severance of commercial and financial relations

                            save for colorless reservations by Argentina and Chile. This unanimous

                        <p>52. The Chilean Foreign Minister announced at the Plenary Session last
                            night that “without the slightest shadow of a doubt, Japan immediately
                            is going to attack Chile”.</p>

                                <p>“Meeting together, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile, Don
                                    Juan B. Rossetti, and the Under Secretary of State of the United
                                    States of America, Mr. Sumner Welles, have considered the
                                    situation created by the conflict in the Pacific with regard to
                                    continental defense measures and in particular the defense
                                    requirements of Chile whose coasts are notoriously open to
                                    attack. In view of the circumstances set forth by Minister
                                    Rossetti, the Under Secretary of State, Mr. Welles, declared
                                    that the United States would take precautionary defense measures
                                    in the waters of the Pacific adjacent to South America and that
                                    should some emergency occur, Chile could count upon effective
                                    military assistance from the United States and that technical
                                    details of such assistance would be agreed upon in the immediate

                            relations with the Axis Powers. He alleges that he has requested
                            authorization to make an announcement of an actual rupture of relations
                            at the closing session of the Conference on Tuesday.<note n="77"

                                    Juan B. Rossetti, and the Under Secretary of State of the United
                                    States of America, Mr. Sumner Welles, have considered the

                                    requirements of Chile to defend its long coastline in view of
                                    the situation created by the fact that the United States has
                                    been the victim of an aggression <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42"
                                        facs="0054"/>by a non-American state, that ten of the
                                    American Republics are at war with the Axis powers, and that the
                                    Meeting of Foreign Ministers at Rio de Janeiro has agreed to a
                                    resolution recommending that all the American Republics sever
                                    their relations with the Axis.</p>
                                <p>In view of the circumstances set forth by Minister Rossetti, the
                                    Under Secretary of State, Mr. Welles, declared that, in accord
                                    with unequivocal assurances to go to the assistance of any
                                    Nation of the Western Hemisphere which has been the victim of
                                    non-American aggression, the United States in the event of an
                                    attack by a non-American country against Chile will take
                                    immediate steps to send naval, air and land forces to repulse
                                    this aggression. In the meantime precautionary defense measures
                                    have been taken to render as unlikely as possible attack upon
                                    the coastline of Chile. The War and Navy Departments would
                                    welcome further opportunity to discuss amplification and
                                    implementation of the conversations previously held with the
                                    appropriate officers of the Chilean Government.”</p>

                        <p>The President, who was consulted with respect to your telegram, thought
                            that you should point out to Rossetti that the United States has
                            undertaken and expects to carry forward with the assistance of the other
                            American Republics concerned the defense of a seaboard on the Pacific of
                            10,000 miles; that since we do not have enough ships to locate them for
                            patrol duty immediately off the coast of each country, they are being
                            located in such areas as to derive the maximum utility; and that in the
                            execution of our assurances of support, which have been made to all
                            countries on the same basis, due account will of course be given to the
                            special geographical situation, the importance of the country as a
                            source of the production of strategic materials, and any other special
                            factors.</p>
                        <p>The President has made it very clear, however, that Chile cannot
                            anticipate any preference over any other American Republic in the
                            protection we can afford which as stated above will take into account
                            all pertinent considerations.</p>
                        <p>The Navy Department suggests that you should also further remind the
                            Chilean Foreign Minister that this Government expects Chile will make
                            all possible military efforts herself to defend her territory and
                            off-shore waters and will protect friendly shipping near the Chilean
                            coast.</p>
                        <p>As Rossetti undoubtedly understands, until Chile signs a Lend-Lease
                            agreement, no deliveries of war materials can be made.</p>

                            the Minister said he will present resolutions of Rio to Congress next
                            week and go before that body to insist on speedy ratification. He is
                            confident he will succeed. This is undoubtedly the program since Mendez
                            has instructed along this line. Rossetti said we may be sure that within
                            a month the Axis Missions will have departed.<note n="79"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Welles</hi>: Rossetti gave a full
                            exposition of the Rio Conference to the Council of Ministers yesterday
                            and was warmly congratulated by his colleagues and by Mendez, who said
                            that he had acted precisely in conformity with the instructions of the
                            Government. I have heard much talk against Rossetti at Rio, and since it
                            is evident that much of this is based on a lack of understanding both of
                            his position and his power, I want to go on record on it.</p>

                                Congress. In other words there would have been no agreement on this

                                make before Congress. Remember that neither Ortega, Saenz, Mora,
                                Bianchi or Alamos<note n="81" xml:id="d44fn81">Chilean Ministers for

                                enterprize to get a ratification for the agreements of Peru, Panama
                                and Habana, and that, Rossetti went to Congress, made the fight,
                                spoke and fought for four hours and got them all ratified. He is a
                                powerful man in debate and very effective and I hope he succeeds in
                                getting the Rio ratification promptly. He thinks he will. As a
                                result of Rio sentiment is changing here; fears are dissipating
                                because of the feeling now that we will help protect the Coast; and
                                there is a general conviction that Chile cannot afford to stand
                                aloof.</item>

                        <p>Juan Antonio Rios, the new President, attended the cocktail of the
                            Chile-American Society for the visiting American journalists. I talked
                            with him briefly. He is a tall, slender, fine looking man with iron grey
                            hair and a fine eye, looking the President. However, he is not a genius
                            or brilliant but he had good sound sense and is conservative in the
                            better sense. He has not been favorable to breaking relations in the
                            past, but since the Rio Conference he has taken no real position. Were
                            he to intervene in Congress he could do much harm but I have a feeling
                            that since action will be taken before he takes power he will stand
                            aloof. I hope so.</p>

                                printed.</note> In your capacity as delegate to the Inter-American
                            Conference on Coordination of Police and Judicial Measures you should be
                            guided by the following instructions: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <list>
                                    <item>“1. The Department is extremely doubtful of the
                                        advisability of entering at this time into any agreement
                                        which might be reached at Buenos Aires for the establishment
                                        of any system of exchange of information with regard to
                                        subversive activities which might entail obligations, real
                                        or implied, for this Government to furnish such information
                                        on demand of any other American republic. The present
                                        attitude of the Argentine Government with respect to full
                                        and unreserved cooperation for defense of the continent is
                                        too well known to require comment. Moreover, there is
                                        serious doubt in the minds of policy officers of this
                                        Department whether any information which might be
                                        transmitted to a central exchange might not find its way
                                        through one means or another into Axis hands.</item>
                                    <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0061"/>
                                    <item>2. For this reason, while desirous of strengthening in
                                        every way consistent with the broad interests of this
                                        Government the general structure of inter-American
                                        machinery, the Department’s attitude towards the conference
                                        in Buenos Aires has necessarily been conditioned by the
                                        attendance at the Conference of certain officials harboring
                                        doubtful sympathy toward this Government.</item>
                                    <item>3. Accordingly, while the American delegate should take
                                        every opportunity to show his willingness to cooperate with
                                        the delegates from the other American republics, he should
                                        avoid making any commitment for an information center on
                                        subversive activities of the type described in numbered
                                        paragraph 1 above, as well as any other commitments for the
                                        exchange of intelligence information without prior reference
                                        to the Department and definite approval of those projects by
                                        Washington.</item>
                                    <item>4. The Department feels, however, that the conference at
                                        Buenos Aires will afford a useful opportunity for the
                                        members of our delegation to get in touch and to establish
                                        friendly relations with representatives of the
                                        law-enforcement agencies of the other American republics who
                                        are concerned with subversive activities and other matters
                                        affecting the political defense of the continent.</item>
                                    <item>5. Upon your arrival in Buenos Aires you will doubtless
                                        want to discuss the conference and its possible aims and
                                        political implications with Ambassador Armour so as to
                                        obtain the benefit of any suggestions which he may desire to
                                        communicate to you.</item>
                                    <item>6. The Department does not intend to present any draft
                                        resolutions for consideration by the conference.”</item>

                        <p>The most important resolutions which have been submitted to the
                            Conference, and the resolutions in which the delegates have indicated
                            the greatest interest are the following: The proposal of Honduras for an
                            inter-American registry of police and judicial records, the proposal of
                            Peru for an inter-American police union, the proposal of Argentina for
                            an interchange of information under the police convention of 1920, and
                            the proposal of Bolivia for a uniform system of identification of
                            criminals.</p>
                        <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0062"/>
                        <p>(Section 2). In order to avoid the recommendation of more than one new
                            inter-American organization and in order to comply with the spirit of
                            the Department’s cable 284 to Montevideo, the American delegates have
                            supported two principal propositions: First, that the several
                            recommendations which propose new inter-American organizations should be
                            included in a single statute of limitation [<hi rend="italic">or
                                convention?</hi>] which will propose a single organization with
                            several functions. Second, that the single project should be submitted
                            to the Pan American Union as a possible basis for an inter-American
                            convention with the provision that the Union will solicit suggestions
                            from the Governments and from the committee at Montevideo,<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d48fn4">For correspondence concerning the Emergency Advisory

                                    74</ref> ff.</note> and that on the basis of the suggestions
                            thus received the Union will prepare a revised draft of convention which
                            may be submitted to a later conference or, in the alternative, may be
                            opened for signature at the Union.</p>
                        <p>(Section 3). In its present form as described in part II of this cable,
                            the single project leaves much to be desired but because the proposed
                            convention is in fact being submitted to the Pan American Union for
                            study, it is recommended that I be authorized to accept it in its
                            present form.</p>
                        <p>Part II. The single project of convention which would be submitted to the
                            Pan American Union for study would create an inter-American police union
                            with the following characteristics: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>(1) Each participating country would send one police or judicial

                                    advisory in character.</p>
                                <p>The police union would compile statutes and regulations dealing

                                    methods used in crimes against the states and its fundamental

                            <p>“The Police Conference terminated in an atmosphere of open hostility
                                toward the Argentines, even Chile deserting Argentina by abstaining
                                from voting on the resolution that became the determining factor in
                                the conversations of the last 2 days of the Conference. This
                                resolution was number 4 Argentina’s proposal for certain amendments
                                in the penal codes of the American countries. As you will recall the
                                first few days of the Conference dragged along without much being
                                accomplished when suddenly on Sunday Dr. Spaeth cleared the air by a
                                few words and extricated the delegates from a morass of technical
                                and philosophical considerations. At once all pretense of
                                continental solidarity, maintained in previous inter-American
                                conferences was abandoned and various delegates (exclusive of our
                                own) ‘went after’ the Argentine delegation. It was plainly intimated
                                that, had Argentina since Rio shown the slightest indication of
                                being disposed to fulfill the promises made at the Conference of
                                Foreign Ministers by men like Prebisch<note n="7" xml:id="d50fn7"

                                    Argentina.</note> that short of breaking relations the
                                Government was disposed to take all necessary steps to join in
                                hemisphere defense, the Conference would probably have accepted
                                Argentina’s proposal. As it was the lack of any such action could be
                                interpreted only as bad faith and thus the delegates did interpret
                                it. In addition the delegates of Brazil and I believe Mexico said to
                                    Frias’<note n="8" xml:id="d50fn8">Jorge H. Frias, Chairman,

                                keep saying its neutrality policy is dictated by realistic and
                                practical considerations because they felt it is dictated by
                                fear—fear of losing a few pesos of foreign trade, fear of attack, et
                                cetera—and frankly in these days something more is expected of a
                                nation that thinks itself important than that fear should govern its
                                foreign policy.</p>

                        <p>Four of the proposals were combined in a single instrument of draft
                            convention which is referred for study to the Pan American Union. The
                            “proyectos” thus combined were submitted by Honduras (1),
                            Nicaragua-Bolivia (3), Argentina (6), Peru (10). (See <pb n="55"
                                xml:id="pg_55" facs="0067"/>Annex “C”) The Argentine proposal on the
                            establishment of national records of habitual criminals on the basis of
                            the Vucetich system of identification (resolution 8, Annex “C”) was
                            considered indirectly, in the draft convention on the Inter-American
                            Police Union, but no specific mention was made in the text of the
                            resolution for the reason that the question of the use of the Vucetich
                            system had been rejected by implication when the Nicaraguan-Bolivian
                            proposal for the use of that system internationally was modified in the
                            sense that the Conference merely recommended the study of an
                            inter-American system of identification.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine proposal for the unification of penal law (No. 4 of Annex
                            “C”) was rejected completely and was replaced by Resolution No. 6 of the
                            Final Act requesting the Committee at Montevideo to undertake the study
                            of a uniform penal law.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine proposal relative to associations (No. 5 of Annex “C”) was
                            modified so as to include direct reference to the members of the
                            Tripartite Pact and states subservient to them.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine proposal relative to expulsion of aliens (No. 7 of Annex
                            “C”) was referred to the Committee at Montevideo for study.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine proposal relative to extradition (No. 9 of Annex “C”) was
                            rejected and in its place it was recommended that the governments study
                            the Convention of Montevideo of 1940.</p>
                        <p>The Venezuelan proposal (No. 13 of Annex “C”) relative to the vigorous
                            enforcement of existing laws, was combined with the Bolivian proposal
                            (No. 16 of Annex “C”) relative to the creation of national police units
                            to combat subversive activities.</p>

                                taken by the several delegations:</hi></p>
                        <p>As I have indicated in my preliminary report, it was the almost unanimous
                            view that the Conference should recognize specifically by direct
                            reference to the Axis Powers that its principal purpose was to recommend
                            measures relative to subversive activities arising out of the present
                            emergency; that it was not the function of the Conference to formulate
                            preventive penal legislation which would anticipate criminal action
                            arising from any source whatsoever. The general formula proposed by
                            Argentina (see a reservation of Argentina at Page 15 of Annex “D”) was
                            recognized as inadequate because (1) it implied an attitude of
                            antagonism towards Russia, (2) it was so flexible that it could be used
                            by any Government to persecute its own nationals for political
                            reasons.</p>
                        <p>It is certain that the breach between Argentina and the other republics
                            would have been more serious and more obvious had it not been for the
                            efforts of the Secretary General, Raúl C. Migone, a member of the
                            Argentine Foreign Office, who was successful in persuading <pb n="56"
                                xml:id="pg_56" facs="0068"/>the Argentine Government not to raise
                            the Communist issue by specific reference to that party in their
                            resolutions. Dr. Jorge H. Frías, the principal Argentine delegate,
                            strongly urged his own Government, and in conversations outside of the
                            committee meetings, urged delegates from the other republics to include
                            specific reference to the Communist menace. The principal Argentine
                            technical assistant, Dr. Eusebio Gómez, had been described as a staunch
                            democrat, but he took the extreme Argentine position throughout the
                            Conference.…</p>
                        <p>The delegate from Chile took every opportunity to avoid an express
                            commitment on controversial issues. He frequently abstained from voting,
                            and near the end of the Conference advised the American delegate
                            confidentially that he had received instructions from his Government to
                            abstain from voting rather than to vote against the United States.</p>
                        <p>The best qualified delegates, both from a technical viewpoint and from
                            the viewpoint of the basic political issues, were those from Brazil,
                            Uruguay and Bolivia. This was due to the fact that the countries named
                            had appointed special delegates to the Conference and had not contented
                            themselves, in the manner of so many other countries, with naming their
                            diplomatic representatives in Buenos Aires.</p>
                        <p>The position taken by the delegate appointed by Haiti deserves special
                            mention and it is possible that the Department may wish to pursue the
                            matter with the Haitian Government. The Haitian delegate, Dr. José
                            Manuel Alvarez Aránguiz, a citizen of Chile, has lived in Argentina for
                            almost 20 years. In several of the subcommittee meetings he voted with
                            Argentina and on no occasion ventured beyond the middle-of-the-road
                            position taken by Chile. He avoided taking a position at the final vote
                            in the plenary session by leaving the meeting immediately before the
                            vote.</p>

                        <p>This topic is treated in my preliminary report, Annex “E”. In brief, the
                            Conference clearly accentuated the position of isolation from the rest
                            of the Hemisphere now occupied by Argentina. This accentuation can be
                            attributed principally to the fact that Argentina was required to take
                            the initiative in the presentation of resolutions. In taking this
                            initiative she presented her usual case for non-discrimination <pb
                                n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0069"/>among non-American belligerents.
                            Because this position was recognized as antithetical to the program of
                            Rio, the Argentine resolutions were rejected, for all practical
                            purposes, completely.</p>
                        <p>The other principal result of the Conference is the additional strength
                            given by its resolutions to the Committee for Political Defense at
                            Montevideo.</p>
                        <p>The resolution which requires careful follow-up consideration by the
                            United States is the measure which recommends that the governments study
                            the project of convention for an Inter-American Police Union, a union
                            which offers the basis for continued cooperation among the police and
                            judicial authorities. The project for the Police Union is to be studied
                            by the Committee for Political Defense and the American citizen member
                            of the committee will submit the results of his study of the union to
                            this Government at an early date.</p>

                            in each mission who are responsible for the work on freezing, alien
                            property controls, and the Proclaimed List will familiarize themselves
                            with the contents of this document. Each Resolution should be carefully
                            studied in connection with the subject matter on the particular topic in
                            the handbook.</p>
                        <p>This Government regards the Conference as having been very successful,
                            bearing in mind the limited role which any conference of this nature can
                            play in contributing to the ultimate objectives. The work done both at
                            the formal sessions of the Conference and at the numerous informal
                            meetings with the representatives of the other governments has, it is
                            believed, clarified for all concerned what should be the ultimate
                            objectives of any successful program. The steps which this Government
                            has taken to carry out these objectives have been fully presented, and
                            many of the problems which the other governments are facing have been
                            fully discussed. If the Resolutions which were adopted at the Conference
                            are actually carried out in the same spirit in which they were, at least
                            from all outward appearance, adopted at the Conference, this phase of
                            our program of economic warfare can be regarded as being highly
                            successful. It is fully realized however that the work done at the
                            Conference is, from a broad point of view, only the beginning and that
                            the biggest part of the job lies ahead. The effective carrying out of
                            these Resolutions by the governments of the American Republics is the
                            step which really counts. In this connection the importance of the role
                            which the officers in the field, who are working on these matters in our
                            diplomatic and consular missions, can play cannot be overemphasized.
                            These officers should keep in close contact with the local freezing
                            control authorities of the respective Republic concerned, consulting
                            with them on the various problems which will arise and furnishing them
                            with ideas as to the steps to take. Except where special circumstances
                            dictate otherwise, those phases of the program envisaged by the
                            Resolutions, which the respective Republic concerned has not effectively
                            carried out, should be called to the attention of the local authorities;
                            and the Department should be kept currently informed as to the progress
                            being made in this connection.</p>

                        <p>This Resolution is aimed at completely cutting off all financial and
                            commercial transactions between the nations of the Western Hemisphere
                            and the Axis and Axis dominated countries. The Resolution provides for
                            the effective immobilization of all funds, securities, and any property
                            of any nature whatsoever which is now held or is subsequently acquired
                            in an American Republic for the account of a person or firm residing or
                            situated in the Axis or Axis dominated countries. Provision is made for
                            complete cessation of trade between the American Republics and the Axis
                            and Axis dominated countries.</p>
                        <p>An individual or firm resident or situated within an American Republic
                            cannot initiate instructions or orders for putting through financial or
                            commercial transactions in Axis or Axis dominated countries. Financial
                            and commercial transactions cannot be effected in one of the American
                            Republics pursuant to instructions given directly or indirectly by a
                            person within the Axis or Axis dominated countries. Thus, instructions
                            or orders given by a person in the Axis or Axis dominated countries
                            relative to use or disposition of his property or funds cannot be
                            carried out in the American Republic where such property or funds are
                            situated. Similarly, the execution of the orders or instructions of a
                            person within an American Republic acting under a power of attorney from
                            a person or firm in the Axis or Axis dominated countries, concerning the
                            use or disposition of any property whatsoever belonging to the donor of
                            the power is contrary to the provisions of Resolution I.</p>
                        <p>However, for your information this Government has not construed
                            Resolution I in such a way as to prevent attorneys-in-fact from
                            effecting transactions under powers of attorney in accordance with
                            certain general licenses when such powers were received in this country
                            prior to the effective date of blocking of the country of the donor and

                            or Axis dominated countries is involved. For example, pursuant to

                        <p>Two types of remittances are excepted from the prohibitions of the
                            Resolution. The first of the excepted remittances is one by the
                            government of an American Republic to an Axis or Axis dominated country
                            for such purposes as (1) living expenses of the citizens of such
                            American Republic who may be in Axis territory, or (2) the expenses of
                            representing the governmental interests of such American Republic in the
                            Axis or Axis dominated countries, such as the care and safeguarding of
                            the property of the government of the American Republic in the Axis
                            territory. Such remittance must be made directly by the Government of
                            the American Republic involved, or, as in most cases where diplomatic
                            relations have been severed, it may be made through the government
                            representing the interests of the respective American Republic in the
                            Axis or Axis dominated country.</p>
                        <p>A second type of excepted remittance is one which the governments of each
                            of the American Republics may authorize (1) for living expenses of the
                            citizens of Axis or Axis dominated nations residing within such American
                            Republic or (2) for expenses of representing the governmental interests
                            of the Axis or Axis dominated nations in the American Republic involved,
                            such as the care and safeguarding of property belonging to such
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Attention is directed to the provision that none of the excepted
                            remittances from the Axis or Axis dominated countries may be made from
                            blocked funds except in those cases where there is an effective
                            reciprocal agreement between the American Republic involved and the Axis
                            or Axis dominated countries. Thus, if the Government of Japan has
                            blocked funds in Peru, (or in any other American Republic), those funds
                            cannot be used for living expenses of Japanese citizens in Peru.
                            However, if Peru has blocked funds in Japan and Japan agrees and does
                            permit the use of such funds for living expenses of Peruvian citizens in
                            Japan, Peru could, consistent with the Resolution, agree to permit the
                            use of a similar amount of the blocked funds of the Japanese Government
                            for necessary living expenses of Japanese citizens in Peru.</p>

                            financial relations with the Axis and Axis dominated countries is one
                            which is very clearly defined both in Resolution V<note n="6"

                        <p>This Resolution relates to financial and commercial transactions with
                            neutral countries outside the Western Hemisphere. The Resolution
                            requires the other American Republics to supervise “adequately” property
                            and funds within their boundaries belonging to countries outside the
                            Western Hemisphere, and their nationals, which have not severed
                            commercial and financial relations with the Axis. The latter of course
                            excludes nations at war with the Axis. Under this provision each of the
                            American Republics should take steps to locate and identify such
                            property and prevent its use in any way that would benefit the Axis. The
                            governments of the other American Republics should take action to assure
                            that persons and firms within their boundaries do not engage in
                            financial and commercial transactions for the benefit of the Axis
                            nations with persons and firms in neutral nations. This prevents all
                            exportations to and importations from the neutral countries as well as
                            remittances to or from such countries if any of these transactions are
                            of benefit directly or indirectly to the Axis or Axis dominated
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, in fulfillment of the Resolution the governments of the
                            American Republics are to prevent all financial and commercial
                            transactions with persons or firms in the neutral countries who are
                            known to be engaged in activities inimical to the security of the
                            hemisphere. In this connection, you might discreetly point out to the
                            local freezing control authorities that the Proclaimed List for the
                            countries outside the Western Hemisphere is one means of determining
                            those persons known to be engaged in inimical activities. However, in
                            carrying out this provision, the other American Republics should use all
                            other information available to them.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the requirements of the subject Resolution, you should
                            carefully study the measures which this Government is taking, vis-à-vis,
                            the various areas outside the Western Hemisphere as described in the
                            above-mentioned handbook on page 9 and following.</p>
                        <p>This Government through freezing control and export control has exercised
                            great caution to determine that the neutral nations outside the Western
                            Hemisphere are not used as channels for Axis trade, financing and
                            communications. In addition to the supervision of trade and commercial
                            transactions with the four European neutral countries through general
                            licenses based upon assurances by those <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63"
                                facs="0075"/>governments that transactions effected pursuant to such
                            general licenses will not benefit the Axis directly or indirectly, this
                            Government has used export control and the Proclaimed List of Certain
                            Blocked Nationals to determine that individuals who are known to be
                            acting for the benefit of the Axis countries have no commercial or
                            financial relations with persons and firms residing or situated in the
                            United States. In general the criteria which this Government has used in
                            determining whether specific export trade transactions will be permitted
                            are the following: (1) that goods or merchandise exported to the neutral
                            involved will not be re-exported to the Axis or Axis dominated
                            countries; (2) that goods or merchandise exported to the neutral
                            involved is not a substitute for goods or merchandise in the neutral
                            country which can be exported to the Axis or Axis dominated countries;
                            (3) that the goods or merchandise exported does not benefit that phase
                            of the economy of the neutral involved which is being used for the
                            benefit of the Axis war effort. While it may be argued that all export
                            trade to the European neutrals benefits the Axis countries, this
                            Government is not prepared to take such a position at this time and does
                            not wish to press that position with the other American Republics in
                            connection with the subject Resolution.</p>
                        <p>Through freezing control and export control this Government has stopped
                            all trade with unoccupied France, and financial transactions are
                            permitted only when it is clear that the Axis will not benefit in any
                            way. This Government through export control supervises trade
                            transactions with those neutral countries outside Europe and the Western
                            Hemisphere, and freezing control licenses are required for financial and
                            commercial transactions with those countries when there is an interest
                            of a blocked national or a person whose name appears on the Proclaimed
                            List of Certain Blocked Nationals.</p>
                        <p>The steps which this Government has taken should not necessarily be
                            construed as meaning that such steps are regarded as compliance with
                            Resolution II. It may be that more drastic steps will be required as
                            events develop. It is hoped that as a minimum the other American
                            Republics as soon as possible will take the necessary steps designed to
                            achieve the results which have been achieved by this Government. Some of
                            those governments may be in a position to take more drastic steps even
                            at this time, and as time passes, it is probable that pursuant to the
                            broad scope of the subject Resolution all of the American Republics may
                            have to take more drastic steps to curtail the benefits which the Axis
                            and Axis dominated countries may derive through trade between the
                            neutral countries outside the Western Hemisphere and the American
                            Republics.</p>
                        <p>Your attention is directed to the phrase “endeavoring not to cause
                            unnecessary damage to neutral nations” appearing in the first paragraph
                                <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0076"/>of the recommendation. That
                            phrase was inserted at the suggestion of the delegation from Chile to
                            cover essential transactions with Spain. It is the hope of this
                            Government that the phrase will not be interpreted in such a manner as
                            to prevent effective action being taken.</p>

                                Republics</hi></p>
                        <p>Paragraph (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) provides for the establishment of an
                            interchange of information with respect to financial and commercial
                            transactions carried on between two different American Republics and in
                            which persons engaged in activity inimical to the security of the
                            hemisphere are involved, or in which one of the persons involved in the
                            transaction is acting for a person outside the Western Hemisphere, in
                            order that each American Republic can prevent such transactions within
                            its jurisdiction. This provision contemplates that the American
                            Republics will effectuate policies similar to the one followed by this
                            Government in connection with the Proclaimed List and it is hoped that
                            the other American Republics will use our Proclaimed List as one means
                            of preventing such international transactions. Thus the program is made
                            more effective by having an international control to prevent such
                            transactions in addition to local controls and in establishing a means
                            of detecting such transactions where one person within the American
                            Republics is acting as a cloak for an individual or firm outside the
                            Western Hemisphere. As illustrations, if A who is residing in Chile and
                            who is not engaged in any sort of inimical activity seeks to remit funds
                            to B in Brazil who is known to be engaged in inimical activity through a
                            bank in Uruguay, Uruguay in fulfillment of the Resolution, as well as
                            Chile, is obligated to prevent the transaction. Similarly, if A in Chile
                            should seek to remit to B in Brazil who is acting for a person outside
                            the Western Hemisphere and this fact is known to Brazil, Brazil is
                            obligated to prevent the transaction. Of course in either case the local
                            controls of Brazil should be sufficient. However, by the international
                            controls the entire program is strengthened and the laxity of controls
                            in any particular country is guarded against by the international
                            controls.</p>
                        <p>The efficacy of this Resolution depends upon the extent to which each
                            mission pursues the policy of interchanging information with the local
                            government concerned. The importance of this Resolution and of the
                            interchange of information provisions cannot be overemphasized. Pursuant
                            to this Resolution we may eventually be able through such interchange of
                            information to ascertain the true ownership of assets held in this
                            country by firms in the other American Republics as cloaks for
                            principals outside the Western Hemisphere and the true ownership of the
                            assets of Panamanian holding companies, <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65"
                                facs="0077"/>etc. The Axis Powers in preparing for their attempt at
                            world conquest have cloaked their funds and property in the names of
                            individuals and firms located in the Western Hemisphere and have planned
                            to carry on financial and commercial transactions to further the Axis
                            war effort through these cloaks. They have done their work well and the
                            problem of ascertaining the true ownership of assets is a difficult one.
                            However, if the wholehearted cooperation of the government to which you
                            are accredited can be obtained in the free exchange of information
                            concerning cloaking activities and the ownership of assets, such can be
                            uncovered and stopped. However, if the United States and the other
                            American Republics are left to determine this matter by acting
                            independently, the prevention of cloaking and the discovery of the true
                            ownership of certain assets is most difficult if not impossible in many
                            cases.</p>
                        <p>If the spirit and provisions of paragraph (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) are
                            carried out, transactions involving the monetary unit of an American
                            Republic undertaken by persons or firms in countries outside the Western
                            Hemisphere which have not severed financial and commercial relations
                            with the Axis can only be effected through the controls of the American
                            Republic whose monetary unit is involved. Thus, the other American
                            Republics are required to prevent transactions in dollars undertaken by
                            persons or firms located in such nations outside the Western Hemisphere
                            unless that transaction is undertaken through a bank in the United
                            States. Effecting such transactions through the branch of a United
                            States bank located in one of the other American Republics is not a
                            compliance with the Resolution.</p>
                        <p>The following examples show some of the transactions comprehended by the
                            Resolution: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) An Argentine bank is holding
                            dollars in New York in an account in its name but actually for the
                            account of a firm in Switzerland; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) A Brazilian
                            bank has a dollar account on its books in Brazil for a firm in France;
                                (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) An Argentine bank has an obligation to a
                            French firm, which although not expressed directly in dollars is linked
                            in one form or the other to the dollar (and probably covered by dollar
                            deposits in a New York bank in the name of the Argentine bank). If the
                            spirit and provisions of Resolution III are carried out, transactions in
                            the dollar accounts in (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>) could only be effected pursuant to the United States
                            freezing control since they would have to be effected through a United
                            States bank and such bank is to be furnished with a report sufficient to
                            establish the nature of the transaction. Example (<hi rend="italic"
                                >c</hi>) goes a step further and probably should not be pressed with
                            the local authorities at this time. However, such transactions coming to
                            your attention should promptly be reported to the Department.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) includes the all important category
                            of cases in which a person in an American Republic seeks to avoid the
                            local <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0078"/>controls by using the
                            financial and commercial facilities of another American Republic whose
                            controls are not as strict as those of his own country to effect a
                            financial or commercial transaction with a person or firm residing or
                            situated in a country outside the Western Hemisphere which has not
                            severed commercial and financial relations with the Axis. For the
                            purpose of illustration, assume that Argentina has not taken adequate
                            measures to effectuate Resolution II or that the Argentine controls
                            effectuating that Resolution are not as strict as those of Brazil. X,
                            who resides in Brazil, intends to remit funds to Y in Switzerland.
                            Brazil refuses to license the transaction, whereupon X transfers his
                            funds to an Argentine bank and seeks to remit such funds to Y in
                            Switzerland. Notwithstanding that Argentina might permit persons
                            resident in Argentina to effect such a remittance, it is obligated under
                            this Resolution to prevent the remittance unless the Brazilian
                            authorities expressly give their consent. Likewise if A in Switzerland
                            remits to B in Argentina who has instructions to remit to C in Bolivia,
                            notwithstanding the policy of Argentina concerning such transaction, if
                            Resolution III is fulfilled, Argentina is obligated to prevent the
                            transaction unless the Bolivian authorities expressly give their
                            consent. The same is true of trade transactions. Thus paragraph (<hi
                                rend="italic">c</hi>) of Resolution III, if fulfilled, prevents
                            persons within the American Republics avoiding their local controls by
                            using the commercial and financial facilities of the American Republic
                            whose controls are weakest.</p>
                        <p>Another type of case included within the provisions of paragraph (<hi
                                rend="italic">c</hi>) is a transaction in which a firm in the United
                            States is involved with a Brazilian concern. With the knowledge of the
                            Brazilian concern and the Brazilian authorities, but without the
                            knowledge of the United States firm, a French firm is also interested in
                            the transaction. Brazil should prevent the transaction unless the United
                            States freezing control authorities, with full knowledge of the facts,
                            give their approval.</p>

                        <p>This Resolution is directed toward preventing transactions in securities
                            in the American Republics which may benefit the Axis. As you know, the
                            Nazis obtained considerable quantities of securities from the invaded
                            countries and have attempted to use these looted securities to obtain
                            exchange for the purpose of furthering their war effort. To guard
                            against this, all securities imported into the American Republics from
                            points outside the Western Hemisphere are to be blocked until it is
                            definitely established that the Axis, Axis dominated countries, or
                            individuals or firms within such countries have <pb n="67"
                                xml:id="pg_67" facs="0079"/>not had an interest in such securities
                            since the beginning of the present emergency, i. e., September 1,
                            1939.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) refers to securities which are being
                            imported and the phrase “directly or indirectly” would make the
                            provision applicable to securities imported into Colombia from Venezuela
                            if those securities had been imported into Venezuela from nations
                            outside the Western Hemisphere since September 1, 1939. Except for such
                            situations, the Resolution does not obligate the American Republics to
                            take measures to subject securities which have been imported in the past
                            to precautionary blocking except that non-bearer securities imported
                            after September 1, 1939, may, in the discretion of the government
                            involved, be subjected to such precautionary blocking. The Resolution
                            recommends that necessary supervisory measures be taken in order to
                            prevent transactions of any nature relating to securities located
                            outside the Western Hemisphere, if such transaction will benefit a
                            person within Axis or Axis dominated countries. Unless this provision is
                            rigidly enforced, a way is left open for the Axis to acquire badly
                            needed foreign exchange for its war effort. The Axis could sell looted
                            securities located in Switzerland to a person in Argentina and thus
                            acquire free Argentine pesos which it could convert into whatever
                            currency was most needed at the time to obtain materials for the Axis
                            war machine. It is known that the neutrals are being used in this
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) recommends that the American
                            Republics take the measures necessary to determine whether the Axis or
                            Axis dominated countries, or persons resident therein, have any interest
                            in securities issued or payable in any of the American Republics. This
                            paragraph was inserted at the suggestion of the Mexican delegation. As
                            originally drafted the Mexican delegation intended that each American
                            Republic should require a registration with its diplomatic and consular
                            offices of all securities issued or payable in such American Republic,
                            together with the presentation of evidence to prove that no individual
                            or firm within the Axis or Axis dominated countries had any interest in
                            such securities. In view of the enormous amounts of securities issued or
                            payable in the United States, this would have placed an impossible
                            administrative task on this Government. Accordingly, the phrase “or
                            adopt any other appropriate measures” was added and the paragraph
                            otherwise changed to its present form.</p>
                        <p>As originally drafted this Resolution covered other situations, such as
                            the effective blocking of securities in which individuals or firms in
                            the Axis and Axis dominated countries had an interest; the prevention of
                            transactions effected within the American Republics in securities, such
                            as sale, hypothecation, etc., pursuant to instructions <pb n="68"
                                xml:id="pg_68" facs="0080"/>from Axis or Axis dominated territory;
                            and provisions preventing persons within the Axis or Axis dominated
                            countries from exercising any rights in connection with securities
                            issued or payable within any American Republic (including that of voting
                            at meetings). The Resolution was passed in its present form and without
                            certain of the provisions contained in the original draft on the theory
                            that such provisions were covered by Resolutions I, II and VI.
                            Accordingly, you should bear in mind such Resolutions in addition to the
                            subject Resolution in so far as transactions in securities, security
                            interests, dividends, coupons, etc. are concerned.</p>

                                Financial and Economic Controls Within the American
                            Republics</hi></p>
                        <p>The Resolution recommends that the economic and financial controls have
                            as one objective the control of property and transactions of all persons
                            within the American Republics who are known to be engaged in activity
                            inimical to the security of the hemisphere. Many of the American
                            Republics which have adopted controls have applied those controls upon
                            the basis of nationality. It is well known that many of the persons in
                            the Western Hemisphere, who are engaged in activity on behalf of the
                            Axis nations, have acquired the citizenship of one of the American
                            Republics. Furthermore, there are many persons in the American Republics
                            who are citizens of the Axis countries but whose loyalty to the country
                            in which they reside is unquestioned. Accordingly, it is highly
                            desirable that the financial and property controls be directed against
                            the individuals and firms who are known to be engaged in inimical
                            activity rather than to attempt to control the activities of individuals
                            and firms on the basis of nationality when there is nothing to indicate
                            that many of them are engaged in inimical activity.</p>
                        <p>The Resolution provides that when the controls are directed against those
                            who are known to be engaged in inimical activity, the object of the
                            controls shall be the elimination of the undesirable activity and
                            influence of such individuals and firms from the economic life of the
                            country involved. In this connection, it is pointed out that, while such
                            controls will not have as their express objective the permanent
                            elimination of such individuals and firms from the economic life of
                            these countries, the measures which are required to eliminate their
                            undesirable influence from the economic life of the American Republics
                            during the time of the present emergency will, in many cases,
                            necessarily be such as to eliminate them permanently.</p>
                        <p>No specific reference was made to the “Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked
                            Nationals” in any of the Resolutions. It was felt that any <pb n="69"
                                xml:id="pg_69" facs="0081"/>reference to the Proclaimed List in such
                            Resolutions might open the way for attack on that list and for requests
                            for deletions on the basis that local controls had been instituted. The
                            Department and the Treasury Department were of opinion that any problems
                            relating to the Proclaimed List could best be settled by bilateral
                            rather than multilateral discussion. It is possible, however, that as
                            the other Republics institute controls and subject firms appearing on
                            the Proclaimed List to such controls, requests will be made by the
                            governments involved for the deletion of the controlled firms from the
                            list. Such requests should promptly be transmitted to the Department,
                            together with your recommendation and the facts necessary to make a
                            determination as to the effectiveness of the local control in each
                            particular case. In this connection your attention is directed to the
                            relevant discussion herein concerning Resolution VII.</p>
                        <p rend="center">VI</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Standards of Effective
                            Blocking</hi></p>
                        <p>Obviously, control measures are meaningless if they do nothing more than
                            block certain funds and release those funds at the request of the owners
                            or allow the use of such funds to the benefit of the owners.
                            Accordingly, it is most important that this Resolution be carried out in
                            all respects. The blocking measures will necessarily include all cash,
                            securities, income or other assets of any other kind.</p>
                        <p>Your attention is directed to the fact that the proceeds of sale or
                            liquidation of undesirable firms must be effectively blocked. In the
                            absence of such controls, little if anything will be accomplished in
                            this area.</p>
                        <p>Under paragraph 3 of such Resolution the American Republics are in
                            agreement that blocked assets may not be disposed of without the
                            authorization of the government involved and any attempt to dispose of
                            them or to transfer them without such authorization is null and void.
                            One of the purposes of this provision is to prevent blocked individuals
                            from selling their blocked assets to a person who is willing to take the
                            chance of their eventually being unblocked and paying free funds to the
                            blocked person for such assets. Also, this provision is an effective
                            measure for the enforcement of financial and property control laws and
                            decrees.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph 4 provides that all blocked cash or securities are to be
                            deposited in the central bank, approved banks or appropriate
                            organizations designated by the government involved. The purpose of this
                            provision is to tighten the blocking controls and have certain
                            designated institutions carrying the blocked accounts rather than having
                            every individual or firm carrying blocked accounts on its books or
                            otherwise for blocked individuals.</p>
                        <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0082"/>
                        <p>Careful examination should be made to determine the manner in which the
                            government to which you are accredited allows the withdrawal of blocked
                            assets. No withdrawal should be permitted under the terms of the
                            recommendation if it would benefit the Axis either directly or
                            indirectly in any way. Obviously, blocking does not mean that there may
                            be no withdrawals or that individuals subjected to such control measures
                            may not be allowed funds for minimum living expenses. However, pursuant
                            to the recommendation, they may receive for this purpose only such funds
                            as are <hi rend="italic">essential to the subsistence</hi> of the
                            blocked individual and that of his family. The recommendation
                            contemplates that the governments of each of the American Republics will
                            set maximum periodical amounts and that no authorizations for living
                            expenses will exceed such amounts.</p>

                        <p>This Resolution is directed at the business enterprises which are acting
                            against the political and economic independence or security of the
                            American Republics. The business enterprises which fall in this category
                            are to be determined by the government of the American Republic
                            involved. However, as provided in Resolution VIII, it is contemplated
                            that there will be a free exchange of information on this and other
                            matters. Thus, if you have facts that a business enterprise is engaged
                            in inimical activity, such facts should be made available to the
                            appropriate local authorities. Likewise, if this Government through
                            censorship, reports from other missions, etc., obtains information
                            indicating that a firm resident or situated in the country to which you
                            are accredited is engaged in some sort of inimical activity, that
                            information will be forwarded to you in order that you may bring it to
                            the attention of the appropriate authorities. In such cases, you will,
                            of course, follow the situation and keep the Department fully
                            informed.</p>
                        <p>The Resolution provides that business enterprises which are acting
                            against the political and economic independence or security of the
                            American Republics shall be the object of forced transfer or total
                            liquidation or if, in the opinion of the government concerned, this is
                            not convenient, then the purposes of the Resolution are to be carried
                            out through means of blocking, occupation or intervention. The term
                            “forced transfer” includes vesting, i. e., transfer to the
                            government.</p>
                        <p>The delegations of the United States and of certain other countries would
                            have preferred a Resolution requiring: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the
                            vesting of all businesses essential to the economy of the particular
                            country which act in the interests of the Axis; (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>) the liquidation of all non-essential <pb n="71"
                                xml:id="pg_71" facs="0083"/>firms which so act; and (<hi
                                rend="italic">c</hi>) the reorganization, through intervention or
                            otherwise, of firms which are only partially bad or which have been
                            subjected to control for trading reasons, etc. However, some of the
                            other delegations took the position that in view of the fact that forced
                            sales of Axis properties are cited in Resolution V adopted at the Third
                            Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, as one alternative method
                            of procedure with respect to essential enterprises, the recommendations
                            in the subject Resolution for the handling of such firms must also be
                            stated in the alternative. However, in the actual drafting of the
                            Resolution, it was possible to obtain agreement on emphasizing the
                            methods of liquidation and vesting which are set forth as the general
                            rule to be followed. In deciding upon the desirability of intervening in
                            the management of Axis controlled firms instead of subjecting them to
                            the forced transfer procedure, it should be borne in mind that in cases
                            of firms owned or controlled from enemy territory and firms owned by
                            persons engaged in inimical activity, wherever resident, this Government
                            is not in general prepared to accept intervention as a basis for their
                            deletion from the Proclaimed List. In such cases, the device of forced
                            transfer, including vesting (or liquidation) would therefore be more
                            desirable to all parties concerned.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) of the subject Resolution provides
                            for the removal of undesirable employees from firms which are engaged in
                            inimical activities. Under the law of some of the American Republics,
                            persons so removed would be entitled to severance payments. Pursuant to
                            the terms of the Resolution, such payments would be blocked. It is
                            possible that there will be cases where undesirable employees cannot be
                            replaced immediately, in which case it will be necessary that they be
                            kept in the employ of the firms subjected to the measures outlined
                            above. However, it is emphasized that such retention should only be of a
                            temporary character. In such cases, salaries and other remuneration of
                            those so <hi rend="italic">temporarily</hi> employed shall be supervised
                            in such a manner as to comply with the terms of this Resolution. It is
                            felt that such salaries and other remuneration can only be adequately
                            supervised by blocking according to Resolution VI.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) provides that contracts contrary to
                            the purposes of the Resolution, (such as patent agreements, etc. with
                            German firms like I. G. Farben) entered into by individuals and firms
                            comprehended within the Resolution shall be rescinded and such of those
                            firms holding contracts or concessions for the exploitation of natural
                            resources, public services, such as lands, mines, water rights,
                            transportation and such, may also be rescinded. This provision might be
                            construed so as to require the American Republics to protect firms and
                            individuals who refuse to comply with contracts entered into with firms
                            subsequently <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0084"/>found to be engaged
                            in inimical activity and thus subjected to control.</p>
                        <p>Many of the firms comprehended by the provisions of this Resolution will
                            no doubt be subjected to forced sale. The proceeds accruing from such
                            sale are to be blocked according to Resolution VI, and the same is true
                            in connection with income accruing from intervened or supervised
                            businesses. Of course where a firm is subjected to total liquidation,
                            the proceeds of the liquidation will be subjected to blocking as set
                            forth in Resolution VI.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) provides that properties
                            comprehended in the terms of this Resolution can only be sold or
                            transferred to nationals of the country involved or to juridical persons
                            formed by them. It is important to note that under the terms of this
                            paragraph a person, real or juridical, whose property is subject to the
                            provisions of this Resolution and the transfer of which is forced,
                            cannot have any direct or indirect participation in the transaction,
                            such as in the selection of buyers, etc. Accordingly, it is important
                            that each mission investigate each such transaction and where it appears
                            that the buyers of the properties comprehended in the terms of the
                            Resolution are such as are likely to be friendly, now or later, with the
                            Axis interests or those individuals whose interests have been taken
                            over, such facts should be brought to the attention of the appropriate
                            local authorities and promptly reported to the Department.</p>
                        <p>It is probable that some of the other American Republics may need
                            financial assistance in the form of loans from this Government to the
                            government of the American Republic involved in order to carry out an
                            effective program along the lines of the subject Resolution. For your
                            confidential information, it is expected that this Government will be
                            able to render such assistance where necessary.</p>

                        <p>This Resolution provides for reciprocal cooperation among the American
                            Republics in carrying out Resolutions V and VI adopted by the Third
                            Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics,
                            the recommendations adopted at the Inter-American Conference on Systems
                            of Economic and Financial Control, and measures which have been or may
                            be taken by the governments of the American Republics. Pursuant to this
                            recommendation, it is envisaged that there will be close cooperation
                            between this Government and each of the other American Republics, and
                            among the other American Republics concerning the actions which each has
                            taken to implement its financial and property controls as stated above.

                            to the local authorities that, in the event that they are in possession
                            of information which would be of benefit to this Government in enforcing
                            its financial and property controls, such information should be given

                        <p>It is suggested that each mission promptly communicate to the Department

                            are not clarified by the subject instruction in order that circular

                            with Guani late morning. Conference indicated Guani’s personal interest
                            in work of commission. Inaugural session 5:30 this afternoon opened by
                            Guani who was followed by each of the members. All speeches stressed
                            need for unity combating subversive activities. Summaries being sent by
                            air mail. Very little done to date to establish organization and
                            secretariat. My impression is that both in organization [of] the
                            committee and in development of its work chief responsibility will fall
                            on American member which points up need for adequate briefing within
                            Department. Guani elected chairman. Following is official list of the
                            delegates: Argentina: Miguel Angel Chiappe; Brazil: Mario de Pimental
                            Brandão; Chile: Joaquin Fernández Fernández; Mexico: Carlos Darioojeda;
                            Venezuela: Eduardo Arroyo Lameda; Uruguay: Alberto Guani. Ambassador and
                            staff have been most helpful in getting us established. [Spaeth.]</p>

                            subservient to them, as well as organizations of all kinds controlled by
                            such nationals, to file periodic reports as a condition precedent to
                            receiving a certificate of good conduct. The required reports would
                            include statements as to whether the Axis national or organization has
                            contributed funds or property in the interest of the Tripartite Pact,
                            participated <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0088"/>in any manner in any
                            activity on behalf of the Tripartite Pact, or had knowledge of such
                            activity on the part of others. Substantial fines or imprisonment would
                            be imposed for failure to report, for falsification of the reports, and
                            for any repetition of pro-Axis activities actually disclosed. The
                            proposal is not only designed to put additional pressure upon enemy
                            groups, but would afford nationals of the Tripartite Pact who are
                            friendly to the democracies, an opportunity to establish their loyalty
                            and by so doing, to free themselves from prejudice or discrimination
                            under local laws. In addition, the proposal seems to have the merit of
                            hitting directly at a basic problem pending the preparation of more
                            comprehensive recommendations on the subject of registration and

                            7, April 29. The proposal of the Brazilian member for reports by Axis
                            nationals received a full discussion on the merits in Monday’s meeting.
                            The Argentine member, who was clearly acting on instructions, declared
                            that he would support the recommendation only if it were submitted to
                            the Conference of Police and Judicial Authorities.<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d57fn7">See <ref target="#pg_48">pp. 48</ref> ff.</note>
                            Argentina based its argument on the untenable jurisdictional point that
                            the Committee’s powers are subordinate to the powers of the Conference.
                            Chilean member who was also acting on instructions said that he would
                            have to abstain from voting because Chile has already adopted
                            registration laws. The registration law of Chile is general in character
                            and of course is not aimed directly at Axis nationals in the manner of
                            the Brazilian proposal.</p>
                        <p>All of the other members (who are apparently authorized to vote without
                            reference back to their respective Governments) supported the Brazilian
                            proposal on its merits and vigorously opposed the narrow jurisdictional
                            point raised by Argentina. The discussion emphasized that the system of
                            reporting would afford friendly enemy aliens an opportunity to establish
                            their word in addition to inducing disclosure by unfriendly groups.</p>
                        <p>Because of the sharp fundamental difference of opinion thus developed it
                            is probable that I shall be required to participate in a <pb n="77"
                                xml:id="pg_77" facs="0089"/>[apparent omission] on the matter prior
                            to the Department’s receipt of the full text of the Brazilian proposal.
                            Because I believe that the proposal is fundamentally sound, and because
                            it would be extremely unwise to give an impression of doubt with regard
                            to the first serious disagreement on a matter of principle, I intend to
                            vote affirmatively. If it is possible to do so with apparent good cause,
                            I shall try to defer the vote. [Spaeth.]</p>

                        <p>250. Embassy’s 341, May 5, 1 p.m. For the Ambassador and Mr. Spaeth.
                            Although it is not entirely clear whether the Chilean and Argentine
                            members stated that their actions with regard to the proposal introduced
                            by the Brazilian member were in response to specific instruction from
                            their Governments, the Department feels that the situation thus created
                            poses a basic issue which if allowed to become a precedent would
                            adversely affect the whole future of the Committee for Political
                            Defense. The Department believes therefore that provided you both
                            perceive no objection the Ambassador acting on behalf of this
                            Government, but accompanied by Mr. Spaeth, in order to indicate the
                            gravity with which we view the situation, should present orally to Guani
                            as President of the Committee the views of this Government somewhat
                            along the following lines: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Government of the United States has been informed by its
                                    Ambassador in Montevideo that there appears to be some

                                    for Political Defense with respect to the character of their
                                    functions and those of the Committee.</p>
                                <p>It is the understanding of the Government of the United States

                                    American Union that the idea in creating a committee of 7 rather
                                    than 21 members appointed by individual American republics was
                                    that the Committee and the members thereof would represent the
                                    21 American republics as a whole and not the individual
                                    Governments who appointed the 7 members. This Government
                                    considers it not only proper but necessary that individual
                                    governments supply such information as may be called for by the
                                    Committee as well as any useful background information which may
                                    serve as a guide for the individual members of the Committee
                                    with respect to the attitudes and policies of the several
                                    American republics. It does not, however, believe that it would
                                    be either just or conducive to the utility of the Committee were
                                    7 Governments to claim for themselves the <pb n="78"
                                        xml:id="pg_78" facs="0090"/>privilege of attempting to speak
                                    for all 21 American republics by controlling the action of the
                                    members. It would appear that since the resolutions of the
                                    Committee are merely advisory in character, each American
                                    government is amply protected in its liberty of action in
                                    determining whether part or all of any recommendation which may
                                    be submitted to it can be accepted and put into effect.
                                    Moreover, it is only to be expected that certain
                                    recommendations, however well founded in principle, may not be
                                    susceptible of adoption by certain Governments because of
                                    constitutional or political impediments. Also the fact that a
                                    country may have adopted legislation or taken action along
                                    pertinent lines in advance of the receipt of a recommendation
                                    from the Committee should not affect the desirability of
                                    addressing such recommendations to all of the Governments, nor
                                    does it affect the collective responsibility of any member of
                                    the Committee in acting for all the Governments.”</p>

                        <p>In discussing the matter with Guani you may suggest that as President of
                            the Committee he might discuss the matter with the individual members,
                            or that he may wish, as Foreign Minister of Uruguay, to take up the
                            matter through appropriate diplomatic channels. Finally, Mr. Spaeth may
                            wish to observe that the record clearly shows that the Committee for
                            Political Defense was organized without any reference to or necessary
                            connection with the forthcoming Police and Judicial Conference in Buenos
                            Aires.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have today transmitted
                            my Report No. 3 to the Department.<note n="11" xml:id="d60fn11">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0092"/>
                        <p>I particularly wish to draw your attention to the thoughts which I
                            express in the first two or three pages thereof. In essence, those
                            thoughts are a reiteration of what you recognized in your first
                            statement to me about the work of the Committee: that the Committee will
                            be no more than what our Government is able to make of it. You will
                            recall that we also recognized that the task was threefold: first,
                            thorough preparation in Washington; second, negotiation in Montevideo;
                            and, third, follow-through by tactful representations to the several
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>As my reports indicate, notwithstanding the difficulties caused by the
                            member from Argentina, I have full confidence in the potentialities of
                            the Committee. I believe, however, that the Committee can be of
                            substantial assistance in working toward our basic objectives only if I
                            am adequately briefed by the Departments in Washington. I wish to
                            emphasize that by “briefing” I do not mean the presentation of formal
                            recommendations from our Government which might be construed as binding
                            upon it once affirmative Committee action is taken. I have in mind,
                            rather, the information about problems and the informal suggestions with
                            regard to their solution which will enable me as a representative of all
                            of the Republics to give effective guidance to Committee
                            discussions.</p>
                        <p>In the short time that I have been privileged to work with you I have
                            been impressed above all by your desire to strengthen the organizations
                            which have been established on an inter-American basis. I believe, as I
                            am certain you do, that there could be nothing worse for the long term
                            Hemisphere program than failure by inter-American bodies in the
                            realization of the purposes for which they were established. The impact
                            upon international morale of the failure of the League of Nations and
                            some of its subordinate organizations constitutes a warning for those
                            who are endeavoring to strengthen the spirit of cooperation among the
                            American republics. Under the impetus of the emergency we have an
                            extraordinary opportunity to establish the proposition that
                            inter-American bodies such as the Committee for Political Defense can be
                            made to function effectively. The sincerity and strength of my feeling
                            in this matter explain my insistence that persons working on the
                            problems of the Committee in Washington appreciate the seriousness of
                            their responsibility to brief (in the sense expressed above) the
                            Committee thoroughly on all aspects of Resolution XVII.</p>
                        <p>With best regards,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Carl</hi>: Thank you for your letter of May 8.
                            I hope you will continue to write me in complete frankness with regard
                            to developments in connection with the Committee on Political
                            Defense.</p>
                        <p>First let me assure you, as I said prior to your departure from
                            Washington, that we in the Department attribute great importance to the
                            Committee and its work. In our opinion the potentialities which lie
                            ahead of the Committee are far reaching, not merely as an instrument for
                            the prosecution of political warfare today, although that alone is
                            considerable, but also as a stabilizing element of the greatest value in
                            the inter-American machinery. It seems probable that either this
                            Committee or some other inter-American instrumentality will have to
                            continue to function in the unsettled post-war period.</p>
                        <p>We cannot therefore afford to let the Committee fall short of its
                            purpose. For this reason we are building up as rapidly as possible the
                            promised organization within the Department which I feel sure will
                            provide you with the “briefing” which you have requested for your work.
                            As you know, the permanent Departments of the Government do not have the
                            same freedom in budgetary matters as do the emergency agencies, but I am
                            glad to say that the Bureau of the Budget has just approved the
                            establishment of a special section in the Division of the American
                            Republics which is already being recruited.</p>
                        <p>I have said above that no one can foresee the future of the Committee but
                            I would like to make certain observations with regard to its possible
                            growth. The prestige of the Committee depends, as you have observed, on
                            these first few months of its existence. If it is to be the permanent or
                            semi-permanent organ of inter-American action which we hope it will be,
                            it is important both that it not die of inanition and that it not become
                            so active that it run against opposition which might stunt its growth.
                            In other words, it would be advisable that the Committee, during the
                            first months of its existence, should put roots down and become firmly
                            embedded before attempting to weather the storm that might blow up if a
                            subject of too serious disagreement on the part of the members appointed
                            by Argentina and Chile is broached. Both Argentina and Chile must be
                            continually reminded of their commitments and stimulated to take action,
                            but it would definitely not be desirable to risk a show-down at this
                            juncture, particularly since there are signs that Chile is reconsidering
                            its policy. <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0094"/>I repeat, the CPD
                            should not wreck itself on an issue in international politics which it
                            now lacks power to handle. Meanwhile, the Department’s bilateral action
                            bears the brunt of this situation. There are grounds for hope that it
                            will improve.</p>
                        <p>Once the prestige and semi-permanent character of the Committee is
                            established, particularly if one of the states which has not carried out
                            the recommendations of Resolution 1<note n="12" xml:id="d61fn12">For
                                text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                                February 7, 1942, p. 118.</note> of the Rio Meeting should be
                            brought back into the fold, the Committee would be in a position to
                            expand the field of its action and to make stronger recommendations with
                            good prospects of success. It might even reach the point where its moral
                            influence would have great effect directed at a non-cooperative
                            state.</p>
                        <p>Although it is probable that this Government, particularly the
                            intelligence agencies thereof, would not have any objection to the
                            establishment of an information center along the lines laid down in
                            Annex B of your report no. 4 of May 15<note n="13" xml:id="d61fn13">Not
                                printed.</note> as modified by your telegram no. 10 of May 23, 1
                            p.m. to Chapin,<note n="14" xml:id="d61fn14">Not printed; it was
                                transmitted as No. 411 from Montevideo.</note> we feel very
                            definitely that an exchange of information with regard to persons
                            engaged in subversive activities should be limited to persons either
                            under indictment or who have been convicted. This would seem to be as
                            far as we can go on information with regard to individuals which we
                            “must” transmit to such an organization. It is possible, however, that
                            on a voluntary basis we might wish to make use of such a center for
                            distribution of information with regard to dangerous suspects engaged in
                            espionage, sabotage or dissemination of totalitarian propaganda whom we
                            had reason to believe were at large in the American republics. For
                            obvious reasons, however, we would not wish to be in the position of
                            having to supply this information on demand. As you know the process of
                            tracking down subversive groups must necessarily proceed in its initial
                            stages in complete secrecy lest the individuals concerned become alarmed
                            and take cover.</p>
                        <p>The preparation of background material with regard to control of aliens
                            and similar related problems is being continued in conjunction with the
                            Department of Justice. Likewise it is my understanding that some work is
                            being done in connection with measures for the protection of shipping
                            and port facilities looking to the submission of tentative suggestions
                            on this subject.</p>
                        <p>In paragraph II F of Annex B of your report under reference there is a
                            reference to the proposed Inter-American Information Center on
                            Subversive Activities serving as a depository for samples of
                            totalitarian propaganda material of all kinds. We have given <pb n="83"
                                xml:id="pg_83" facs="0095"/>considerable thought to this problem and
                            believe that the Committee on Political Defense could serve a most
                            important role in combatting totalitarian propaganda. While our ideas
                            have not crystallized we have in mind the possibility that the Committee
                            might engage in propaganda analysis with a view to the issuance of
                            regular bulletins to the Governments and the press of the American
                            republics pointing out the major lines followed by Axis propaganda in
                            all media.</p>
                        <p>With this in mind you may wish to consider as a temporary measure pending
                            consideration of the recommendation for the establishment of the
                            information center, suggesting that the Committee call upon the American
                            Governments to submit samples of totalitarian propaganda circulating in
                            their countries together with any analyses of content and media as may
                            have been undertaken. It would seem necessary that this step be taken
                            not only so that the collection can be complete, but so that this
                            Government could appear to respond to request rather than to force the
                            Committee to undertake the additional burden.</p>
                        <p>This, I realize, is a very large order and would, at first blush, require
                            a considerable organization to undertake properly in Montevideo.
                            Fortunately we have such an organization now functioning very
                            efficiently under Professor Doob in the Office of the Coordinator of
                            Inter-American Affairs. We therefore propose some arrangement whereby
                            the bulk of the analysis could be done in Doob’s office with the results
                            forwarded to you promptly by air mail. These results could be checked in
                            Montevideo with the observations of the Committee. Eventually after the
                            ground work had been laid and propaganda analyzed and typed on a
                            systematic basis it might be possible to speed up the process by weekly
                            cable reports.</p>
                        <p>It is our feeling that giving widespread publicity to a dispassionate
                            analysis of enemy propaganda would do as much to defeat the value of the
                            campaign as would any amount of counter propaganda which we might
                            produce, since counter propaganda itself is bound to be labeled as
                            prejudiced no matter how true or how striking be the presentation.</p>
                        <p>I should be glad to have your reactions to the proposal whose broad lines
                            have merely been sketched here. Chapin, who is discussing the matter
                            with Harrison and Doob of the C. I. A. A. will write you further details
                            shortly.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I am sure you will understand me when I make the suggestion that
                            it might be well in the future to clear with the Department any
                            proposals which you yourself submit to the Committee for discussion as
                            possible recommendations. Although I am sure we are in full agreement
                            that the official attitude of the member appointed by the United States
                            should be that he represents the twenty-one <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84"
                                facs="0096"/>republics and not merely this Government, unavoidably
                            there attaches a certain moral obligation to proposals which may have
                            been submitted by that member. It would be embarrassing both to you and
                            to us were the Committee to transmit officially some recommendation
                            based on one of your proposals which we were not in a position to adopt,
                            unless we could prove that we were arriving at the same result through
                            another way. I believe that on normal occasions it should be possible to
                            clear any proposals by air mail pouch but in cases where urgent action
                            seemed essential, you could cable us the essential points of your
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>With all kindest regards and best wishes for your continued success in
                            the Committee, believe me,</p>
                        <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                            transmitting the text of a resolution which we hope will be introduced
                            either by you or if he is agreeable by the Mexican member of the
                            Committee, substantially in its present form.</p>
                        <p>The resolution is intended to open the way for propaganda analysis and
                            regular reports thereon by the Committee to the various governments. A
                            preliminary agreement has been reached with the Coordinator of
                            Inter-American Affairs for the assignment of personnel for this work
                            both in Montevideo and in Washington. We are therefore anxious to secure
                            material from the other American republics as rapidly as possible so
                            that the program may get under way.</p>
                        <p>It is also requested that you advise by cable of the work undertaken by
                            the Committee since the police conference as well as its projected
                            program for the next few weeks. [Spaeth.]</p>

                            preferable in many respects but I do not believe he will oppose its
                            revision. The recommendation on protection of shipping will be
                            resubmitted to Committee this afternoon by special Subcommittee on

                            will probably go to Governments next week. The recommendation on the
                            Inter-American office is now discarded in view of Resolution XIII<note

                            that draft uniform penal law is now one of major assignments of
                            Committee for next period. It is important that we be prepared to deal
                            with this problem on your return.</p>
                        <p>Pimentel, Arroyo and other members of the Committee are determined to put
                            full pressure behind the work of the Committee, particularly in
                            connection with the assignments of the Conference of Buenos Aires. The
                            subcommittees are meeting every day and the full Committee will continue
                            to meet twice a week. Pimentel is talking of holding a public session of
                            the Committee to awaken interest in the right of the Committee. He and
                                Bouza<note n="19a" xml:id="d64fn19a">Luis A. Bouza, delegate from
                                Uruguay.</note> also are convinced that the Committee should have a
                            special intelligence service at its disposal. I am arguing against both
                            of these suggestions and do not believe anything will come of them. I
                            believe Pimentel’s attitude arises in part out of an increasing concern
                            over developments in Africa and about implications for Brazil of
                            complete Axis control in that region.</p>

                        <p>In view of your indication that we may expect personnel in Montevideo to
                            deal with propaganda analysis, I assume you want us to make definite
                            arrangements for securing the apartment next door. Please advise. Guani,
                            Chouhy Terra and I will have a meeting next week to discuss the budget
                            of the Committee. [Sanders.]</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Pursuant to your
                            suggestion, immediately upon my arrival I arranged to see Guani relative
                            to the problems presented by Argentina’s membership on the Committee. My
                            interview was arranged for Saturday, and I went to see Guani at his
                            apartment where he has been kept for ten days by illness. I had not been
                            with him more than ten minutes when the President<note n="19b"
                                xml:id="d65fn19b">Alfredo Baldomir, President of Uruguay.</note> was
                            announced. After he and Guani had had about a quarter of an hour alone,
                            I had the good fortune to spend well over an hour with the two of
                            them.</p>
                        <p>I was greatly impressed by Baldomir. He has a direct and simple manner,
                            gets down to the essentials of a problem very quickly, and seems to know
                            the detailed facts of the important questions facing his country. He has
                            a realistic appreciation of the tremendous fight that lies ahead for the
                            United Nations, and is nevertheless not pessimistic about the ultimate
                            outcome. With regard to the most discussed question of the day (both
                            here and in Argentina)—that of a second front—he stated that he did not
                            see how the Allies could possibly be ready to undertake the job until
                            1943. He is, of course, much concerned about the economic situation of
                            this country, and stated that there were now twenty thousand unemployed,
                            principally in the Montevideo area, and that unemployment will certainly
                            continue to increase. He recognized that we are doing our best to keep
                            Uruguay supplied with essential materials.</p>
                        <p>After a general discussion of economic and military questions, the
                            President gave me an opportunity to speak to the point about which I had
                            come to see Guani by asking me about the work of the Committee and the
                            attitude of our government toward its future. I told him that it is our
                            opinion that the Committee can make a substantial contribution to the
                            political defense of the Hemisphere, but that it will be handicapped
                            considerably so long as Argentina is represented <pb n="88"
                                xml:id="pg_88" facs="0100"/>and pursues its present foreign policy.
                            I stated that this was your view and that you had asked me to discuss
                            the question with Guani. I added that there seemed to be two
                            alternatives, the one less drastic than the other; the appointment by
                            Argentina of a member sympathetic to the cause of the United Nations,
                            or, more drastically, a reorganization of the Committee by the Governing
                            Board of the Union to eliminate Argentina. Without any hesitation, the
                            President stated that the more drastic step seemed necessary, and
                            expressed the opinion that, because of the nature of the subject matter,
                            the membership of the Committee should be limited to republics which
                            have broken relations with the Axis. When I indicated that it is our
                            hope that Chile will soon swing over, the President stated that he held
                            the same opinion, but he maintained that effective Committee work in the
                            control of subversive Axis elements requires a break in relations by the
                            countries which nominate members to the Committee. Guani stated his
                            complete agreement with the President’s position, and authorized me to
                            advise you accordingly. As you will recall, Pimentel Brandào of Brazil
                            has on several occasions expressed substantially the same opinion.</p>
                        <p>It appears that during my absence, Chile has continued to take
                            approximately the same position as Argentina. During the course of the
                            next week I plan to have a frank talk with Fernandez y Fernandez, who
                            has just returned from Santiago, to ascertain whether we can expect a
                            more sympathetic attitude from Chile.</p>
                        <p>It is my own unqualified opinion that the position taken by President
                            Baldomir is the correct one. The political defense program of nineteen
                            republics is being undermined by two governments which refuse to
                            recognize the danger; and in these times we would be mad, and derelict
                            in our defense responsibilities, were we to permit the situation to
                            continue. The fact is that while Argentina and Chile have accepted that
                            part of Resolution XVII of Rio which creates the Committee, they have
                            repudiated, time and again in the Committee’s deliberations, practically
                            all of the substantive provisions of the same Resolution. It is both
                            practically and legally sound to maintain that a republic which has not
                            accepted the substantive recommendations of Resolution XVII should not
                            be privileged to nominate a member of the Committee which is charged
                            with the development of joint programs for the enforcement of the very
                            same recommendations.</p>
                        <p>I appreciate, of course, that action to eliminate Argentina from the
                            Committee would be instituted only after a full survey of the entire
                            Argentine picture; it would necessarily be integrated with other action
                            similarly designed to challenge the ambiguous position of that
                            government. I shall advise you immediately of any further indication <pb
                                n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0101"/>of Guam’s attitude, and will
                            explore the question, quite informally and in a general manner, with the
                            members from Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Welles</hi>: I have given considerable thought
                            to Mr. Spaeth’s proposal that the Montevideo Committee be reorganized so
                            as to omit Argentina.</p>
                        <p>I have been troubled by the idea of eliminating Argentina from an
                            inter-American committee, it being my belief that we have not wanted to
                            put Argentina beyond the pale.</p>
                        <p>I share the view expressed by Mr. Bonsai<note n="20" xml:id="d66fn20"
                                >Philip W. Bonsai, Chief, Division of the American Republics.</note>
                            and Mr. Chapin that the elimination of Argentina from this Committee
                            would irritate Argentina considerably but would not be of a sufficient
                            jolt to move Argentina from its present position.</p>
                        <p>With Brazil in the war and Chile about to break relations it seems to me
                            that the Committee, if there was a real desire on the part of all of the
                            members except Argentina, should have little difficulty in securing the
                            adoption of whatever resolutions seem desirable even though Argentina
                            might object and append dissenting opinions. If Argentina were to
                            continuously oppose the resolutions adopted and this information were to
                            be circulated, I do not think that Argentina would gain thereby or that
                            the Argentine views would affect the thought of the other countries.</p>

                                <p>Under the statute known as the Alien Enemy Act of 1798<note

                                    summary apprehension, internment and to such other restrictions
                                    upon their liberty as may be found necessary in the interest of
                                    national security. Upon the declaration of war and pursuant to
                                    the authority vested by this statute those nationals of the
                                    member States of the Tripartite Pact who were deemed
                                    particularly dangerous were immediately apprehended and interned
                                    for the duration. In addition, all enemy nationals were required
                                    again to register and in that connection to make an immediate
                                    and comprehensive report to the authorities as to their
                                    activities and affiliations, including information as to the

                                    Resolution approved by the Committee. Unfriendly enemy nationals
                                    who were not considered sufficiently dangerous to be interned or
                                    confined for the duration were temporarily paroled and ordered
                                    to report weekly, or less often, to the proper authorities.</p>

                                <p>Under the provisions of another statute any alien who desires to

                                    material for the war effort is required to make a special
                                    application and report to the Secretary of War or the Secretary
                                    of the Navy. The alien is then carefully investigated by the
                                    intelligence agencies and if his loyalty to the United States is
                                    confirmed a special certificate is issued permitting his
                                    employment.</p>
                                <p>Those who comply with all the laws of the country and with all

                                    have been given assurance by the President that they will be
                                    permitted to exercise the usual rights and privileges accorded
                                    aliens by the Constitution and laws of this country.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The following steps have been taken with respect to the surveillance and
                            control of organizations: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Those organizations which were deemed dangerous to the national
                                    security have been proceeded against, their records seized, and
                                    many of their members prosecuted. This and other action has
                                    resulted in the effective dissolution of a considerable number
                                    of organizations.</p>
                                <p>In addition, enemy nationals are forbidden to retain any
                                    membership in or connections with any organization found to have
                                    been subversive in character.</p>
                                <p>Organizations which still exist for certain purposes or are
                                    engaged in certain activities are required under applicable
                                    statutes to file with the Department of Justice a complete
                                    statement of their membership, finances, purposes and
                                    activities, and to report periodically in order to keep current
                                    the information thus furnished. Adequate penalties are provided
                                    for failure to report fully and accurately.</p>
                                <p>A total of some sixteen thousand organizations and branches
                                    thereof are kept under constant surveillance by the
                                    investigative agencies of the Government, even though they do
                                    not appear to be subversive in character. In addition,
                                    continuous studies and analyses are made of some fifteen hundred
                                    publications in English or in various foreign languages, some of
                                    which act as organs for suspected organizations.</p>

                        <p>It is believed that the foregoing described laws and regulations give
                            effect in this country to the substance of proposals contained in said
                            recommendation, except for the suggestion relating to the general
                            issuance of “Certificates of Compliance”.</p>
                        <p>With respect to this subject and in accordance with the statement in the
                            last paragraph of the letter from your Excellency requesting the
                            observations of this Government, I beg to transmit to your Excellency
                            certain inquiries which have been made by officials of this Government
                            who are charged with the control of enemy nationals and of subversive
                            organizations. They would like to know the precise scope of the
                            certificate of compliance and the extent to which it would represent an
                            official verification of the information supplied in the report by the
                            individual or organization concerned. They would appreciate being
                            informed as to whether it is intended that the certificate would be
                            issued mainly upon the basis of an examination of the <pb n="92"
                                xml:id="pg_92" facs="0104"/>report furnished by the individual or
                            organization or whether the certificate would be issued only after a
                            complete investigation of all the associations and activities of the
                            individual or organization. The officials further inquire whether such
                            certificates of compliance would be given a permanent validity or would
                            be limited in time, to be renewed at intervals.</p>
                        <p>In addition, they also seek to inquire as to whether there exists a
                            danger that the certificate might be misinterpreted as an official
                            approval of the individual or organization, of official sanction of its
                            activities, or that the certificate might be used by the unscrupulous to
                            mislead others into believing that it indicated governmental endorsement
                            or sponsorship.</p>
                        <p>The officials of this Government are continuing to give consideration to
                            this problem and deeply appreciate the opportunity of being able to take
                            advantage of whatever further information or advice the Committee will
                            be disposed to offer with respect thereto.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Larry</hi>: Since the beginning of my work for
                            the Committee, I have been seriously handicapped by the apparent
                            reluctance of the Department to supply me with summaries of intelligence
                            information bearing on problems within the Committee’s jurisdiction. I
                            believe that this reluctance on the part of some officials in the
                            Department is based upon a misunderstanding of the type of intelligence
                            information which I need, and the use which I would make of it.</p>
                        <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0107"/>
                        <p>With regard to the type of information which I require, I would stress
                            that I am not interested in, and do not need, names of persons or
                            sources of information. All that I require is a summary statement
                            indicating that intelligence information, which the Department has
                            reason to credit or accept, indicates the existence of specific problems
                            relating to subversive activities in some part of the Hemisphere. I
                            must, of course, have a full statement of the problem, and an indication
                            of the country or place in the Hemisphere where it exists. To
                            illustrate: I was tremendously aided in connection with the Rivera
                                meeting<note n="27" xml:id="d71fn27">See translator’s summary of a
                                letter from the Chairman of the Emergency Advisory Committee,
                                October 16, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> on Entry and Exit
                            of Persons by information from Buenos Aires that Nazi groups in
                            Argentina have been organizing what amounts to an underground railway
                            system to aid Germans seeking to escape from Brazil. This information
                            not only confirmed my opinion with regard to the need for an immediate
                            meeting of border officials, but affected the content of the measures
                            proposed at Rivera. Furthermore, it was not necessary for me to know the
                            source of the information in Argentina, the names of the Germans
                            involved, or anything else of a more specific character; all that I
                            needed to know was that our intelligence information established the
                            existence of a specific problem within the jurisdiction of the
                            Committee. And the same would be true of summaries of intelligence
                            information relative, for example, to Falangist activity in Peru, or
                            propaganda activities in Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the use which I make of such information, I can state
                            without qualification that it will not be made directly available to any
                            member of the Committee. The Committee will benefit by it only as it may
                            induce me, by reason of the indication of urgency or practical
                            importance, to promote certain programs and recommendations more
                            vigorously than others. It should be obvious that with problems as
                            changing, as dynamic, as those with which we are concerned, it is
                            imperative that the American Member of the Committee be supplied with
                            current information which, by reference to specific problems, will
                            indicate apparent weak spots in our political defense structure. Without
                            such information it is difficult for me to assist in making the
                            Committee a useful instrument of political defense, whether by keying
                            its recommendations directly to practical problems, by revealing
                            deficiencies in recommendations or programs already approved, or by
                            laying the groundwork for consultation with the several governments.</p>

                                transmitting a copy of the Final Act and the Secretary General’s
                                report of the Regional Meeting at Rivera concerning the entry and
                                departure of individuals and clandestine transit across
                                borders.</note></head>
                        <p>This meeting was held at the instance of Brazil and upon the decision of
                            the Advisory Committee. Five countries—Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,
                            Paraguay and Uruguay—were represented and two members of the Committee
                            (from Brazil and the United States) attended. Brazil had proposed it
                            because of the problems arising in connection with its entry into the
                            war, particularly the presence of large numbers of people in its
                            territory whose interests were opposed to the defense and security of
                            the continent. The Committee felt it advisable that measures be taken so
                            as not to nullify Brazil’s efforts at control by the emigration of such
                            people to adjacent countries.</p>

                        <p>657. Please call upon Dr. Guani immediately and lay before him the
                            following considerations.</p>
                        <p>It is becoming increasingly evident that Axis interests and those
                            reactionary elements in Chile who are making every effort to prevent any
                            change in Chilean policy have prevented Chilean public opinion and even
                            the great majority of the members of the Chilean Congress from having
                            the slightest knowledge of the serious nature of the Axis subversive
                            activities which have been going on for so long a time in Chile. Chilean
                            public opinion has no conception of the dangers to Chile’s own interests
                            created by these activities nor the vital dangers to the defense
                            interests of the entire Hemisphere which the continuation of these
                            activities constitutes.</p>
                        <p>It therefore seems essential that the true facts as set forth in the
                            secret memorandum handed to the former Chilean Foreign Minister by <pb
                                n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0113"/>the American Ambassador in
                            Santiago on June 30 last be made public.<note n="34" xml:id="d74fn34"
                                >For summary, see <ref target="#pg_225">p. 225</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>Owing to present conditions, if the United States Government itself makes
                            this document public, the extreme nationalists and the Axis interests in
                            Chile will undoubtedly attempt to create the impression that this is an
                            effort on the part of the United States Government to bring pressure to
                            bear upon the Government of Chile and for that reason this Government
                            feels it undesirable, at least at this time, for it to release this
                            information to the press.</p>
                        <p>This Government believes however that the subject matter involved is
                            precisely the kind of problem with which the Committee on Political
                            Defense, under the able and effective chairmanship of Dr. Guani, is
                            called upon to deal. It believes that the danger inherent in the
                            situation which continues in both Chile and Argentina is an increasingly
                            serious danger to all of the other American Republics and that Dr. Guani
                            will coincide with the belief of this Government that the Committee, an
                            Inter-American defense organization created for this purpose, should
                            make it possible for the people of the entire Hemisphere now to have
                            full knowledge of the details involved in Axis activities in all the
                            American Republics and the serious menace resulting therefrom to the
                            security of the Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>Please suggest therefore to Dr. Guani the desirability of his making
                            public, in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Political
                            Defense, not later than Wednesday, November 4, the full text of the
                            secret memorandum of June 30 which is now in his possession and which
                            Dr. Guani has already undoubtedly read. This Government does not know
                            whether Dr. Guani will consider it necessary to submit this question for
                            the formal consideration of the full membership of the Committee, but it
                            would seem that Dr. Guani, as Chairman of the Committee, would be
                            entirely warranted in taking that action without the necessity of any
                            formal approval by the other members of the Committee.</p>
                        <p>In either case, you may say to him, and so inform Spaeth, that the latter
                            is authorized to transmit this document to Dr. Guani for the official
                            cognizance of the latter in his capacity as Chairman of the
                            Committee.</p>
                        <p>You may inform Dr. Guani, for his confidential information, that a
                            similar detailed document covering Axis activities in Argentina<note

                        <p>949. Department’s 657, November 1, 1 p.m. Guani’s reaction to the
                            Department’s proposal is favorable and he stresses his desire to take
                            any action considered necessary by our Government. He expressed
                            reservations on the following three points: <list>

                        <p>Guani is prepared to proceed with the following plans for publication
                            notwithstanding the first reservation since he feels that our Government
                            must have convincing information that this course is necessary. In order
                            to meet the second and third reservations, he suggests the following
                            procedure with which Spaeth agrees:</p>
                        <p>A special meeting of Committee will be called for tomorrow. At the
                            meeting Guani will state that on Monday Spaeth advised him that when our
                            Government transmitted its memorandum of June 30, to Barros Jarpa,<note

                            important that the American member be fully informed in the event that
                            Committee action proved desirable. It is now the position of the
                            American member that the political defense of the hemisphere requires
                            that the Committee have full cognizance of the document and that the
                            document be released for publication by Committee after a reading of the
                            document to the Committee, Guani will state that in his opinion
                            knowledge of the facts by all of the people of the Americas is
                            imperative for hemisphere defense. Upon approval by the Committee,
                            publication will follow immediately.</p>
                        <p>Guani and Spaeth agree that approval of the publication by the members
                            from Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela should be secured before the special
                            meeting is called, and Guani has authorized Spaeth to discuss the matter
                            today with those members.</p>

                        <p>661. Your 949, November 2, 1 p.m. Please express to Guani my deep
                            appreciation of his favorable reaction and cooperative attitude to the
                            proposal that the June 30th memorandum delivered by Ambassador Bowers to
                            the Chilean Government be made public through the Committee for
                            Political Defense. With regard to Guani’s reservations, the Department
                            has the following comments which you may communicate to Guani if you
                            believe it would be helpful: <list>

                                <item>It is believed that Fernández has now had ample opportunity to
                                    study the Chilean situation and to make his plans accordingly.
                                    The Department believes that the publication of the June 30th
                                    memorandum by an inter-American body such as the Committee for
                                    Political Defense will be of real assistance to those Chileans
                                    who favor the carrying out of Chile’s inter-American
                                    obligations. As you know, this memorandum was disregarded, if
                                    not suppressed, by those interested in the maintenance of the

                                    Government is required. (For your own confidential information,
                                    various Chilean high officials are familiar with the contents of
                                    the June 30 memorandum and intend to make use of it in certain
                                    forthcoming events in Chile, so that the document no longer has
                                    the same confidential character as when it was handed to the
                                    Chilean Government 4 months ago.)</item>

                                    Committee. The procedure proposed by Guani seems entirely
                                    satisfactory.</item>

                        <p>954. From Spaeth for the Under Secretary. After 4 hours of debate the
                            committee approved the following resolution:</p>
                        <p>A. The Emergency Advisory Committee for Political Defense was charged by
                            Resolution XVII, as approved unanimously by the Third Meeting of the
                            Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics at Rio de
                            Janeiro, with the study and coordination of the measures to be taken by
                            the said republics to combat the subversive activities of states members
                            of the Tripartite Pact and of states subservient to them.</p>
                        <p>B. The member appointed by the United States of America has submitted for
                            consideration to the Committee a copy of a memorandum <pb n="104"
                                xml:id="pg_104" facs="0116"/>entitled “German Espionage Agents in
                            Chile”, dated June 30, 1942, [which] indicates the existence in the said
                            country of very serious threats to the security of the continent and
                            which demonstrates that the dangers which it reveals are directed not
                            only against one of the republics but against all of the other republics
                            of the continent.</p>
                        <p>C. In view of the gravity of the charges made in the memorandum, which
                            specifically mentions acts undertaken by agents of the Axis against the
                            security of the hemisphere, it is of vital interest to give publicity to
                            the information set forth in the said document, as well as any other
                            facts of the same character, in view of the great value in the
                            collective defense of America.</p>
                        <p>The Emergency Advisory Committee for Political Defense;</p>
                        <p>Resolves: To authorize the President of the Committee to release for
                            general publication through the press and any other means of
                            communication the memorandum dated June 30, 1942 entitled “German
                            Espionage Agents in Chile” prepared by the Government of the United
                            States of America.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum was released to the press at 6 p.m. this evening under the
                            title “Memorandum Prepared for Ambassador Bowers, German Espionage
                            Agents in Chile” and under the date June 30, 1942.</p>
                        <p>The title of the referendum and the presentation to the Committee
                            followed the suggestion by Dr. Guani that the document be presented to
                            the Committee as a copy of a memorandum sent by the American Government
                            simultaneously to the American Ambassador in Chile and the American
                            member of the Commission (refer to Embassy’s cable No. 949 of November
                            2, 1 p.m.). This method of presentation proved to be extremely important
                            because of the position taken by the members from Argentina and Chile
                            that the memorandum is a diplomatic document which relates exclusively
                            to a matter in discussion between Chile and the United States and
                            should, therefore, not be released by the Commission. The majority took
                            the position that the Commission had no knowledge of any pending
                            negotiations or discussions between the two Governments concerned in
                            which the memorandum was involved, and that the issue for the Commission
                            was whether or not publication of the memorandum by an inter-American
                            body would serve the general interest of the continent.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean member voted against the proposal and made a statement for
                            the record to the effect that in view of the fact that the memorandum
                            related to a matter being discussed by the Governments of Chile and the
                            United States, he did not consider it desirable or expedient for the
                            Commission to publish the same without first consulting the two
                            Governments. The Argentine member abstained from voting on substantially
                            the same grounds.</p>
                        <p>Too much emphasis cannot be placed on the assistance and leadership
                            afforded by Dr. Guani in securing the approval by the Commission, <pb
                                n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0117"/>notwithstanding that at one
                            point the Chilean member attempted to embarrass Guani in his position as
                            Foreign Minister by stating that the Chilean Foreign Office could not
                            but look with disfavor upon the publication of the document. The support
                            given to Guani by members from Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela was
                            characterized principally by their support of his position that content
                            of memorandum was a matter of vital concern to defense of all American
                            Republics and that by publishing the document the Commission was not
                            involving itself in a diplomatic situation between two Republics. The
                            majority also shared view of Brazilian member that in consulting
                            Commission regarding publication of memorandum the Government of United
                            States was in a sense curtailing its freedom of action and its sovereign
                            right in order to secure advice of an inter-American body regarding a
                            problem which it felt involved a basic collective interest of the
                            continent, and that Commission could not but respond favorably to this
                            recognition by the most powerful nation on the continent of the validity
                            and efficacy of cooperative method.</p>
                        <p>The Venezuelan member voted with majority but did not participate in
                            debate because of fact Parra Pérez<note n="38" xml:id="d77fn38"

                            American Republics are operated mainly by two groups: the first,
                            comprised of affiliates of I. T. &amp; T.,<note n="4" xml:id="d79fn4"
                                >International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation.</note> and the

                            British, French, and German members. Up to the beginning of the present
                            war, the stock was evenly divided, and, under a trust agreement, each
                            country was represented by two trustees over whom a ninth member with
                            the title of Chairman presided. By mutual agreement, the chairmanship
                            permanently fell to a United States citizen, thereby giving the United
                            States a permanent veto power. The chairmanship remained vacant since
                            the retirement of General Dawes<note n="5" xml:id="d79fn5">Gen. Charles
                                G. Dawes.</note> and was not filled until January 19, 1942.</p>
                        <p>For your information, the consortium stations are located in Argentina,
                            Brazil, and Chile. These stations are organized under local laws,
                            although 60 percent of the stock is owned by the consortium trustees.
                            Department is informed that since Great Britain’s involvement in the
                            war, the control of the German stock of this organization has been taken
                            over by the London Government. However, the consortium stations in South
                            America have continued to take traffic to and from the enemy countries.

                            channels in that area to enemy countries. If this has not been done it
                            may seriously affect outcome of this government’s telecommunications

                        <p>For some months we have been engaged in efforts to discontinue radio
                            communication from South American countries to the Axis capitals—Berlin,
                            Rome and Tokyo. We have been successful in some measure. However,
                            communication still continues from stations in Buenos Aires and
                            Santiago, and information is received that service is to be improved by

                        <p>The situation in Argentina and Chile is complicated. In each of those
                            capitals a station is operated by a local company which is a subsidiary

                            organization with headquarters in London (its address is c/o Cables
                            &amp; Wireless Inc.). The business of the trust is transacted by a
                            committee composed of two representatives each of British, American,
                            French and German interests. The trust was formed in 1921. Under its
                            terms the American member, RCA, may appoint a chairman who shall have no
                            vote except in case of tie but who shall have a veto over any resolution
                            of the Board. There was for a long time a vacancy in the chairmanship
                            formerly filled by General Dawes who resigned. For several years and up
                            to about the first of 1942, there was no chairman. About the first of
                            this year, Retired General Robert C. Davis (Chairman of the New York Red
                            Cross) was named chairman but no meeting of the Board has been held
                            since.</p>
                        <p>The component companies are RCA, Marconi Wireless of England, the French
                            wireless, and the German wireless. The trust is a pooling of resources.
                            Each member transferred (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) all of its
                            concessions, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) all of its licenses to use
                            apparatus devices and systems for communication, and agreed (<hi

                            the subsidiary companies. The trust further witnesses an agreement for
                            an exclusive traffic control within the membership and between them and
                            its <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0123"/>subsidiary companies. This
                            trust and its combined control over its subsidiary organizations in
                            South America expires in 1945, at which time there will be a
                            distribution of the trust property among the parties.</p>
                        <p>Another contemporaneous trust between the same parties sets up an
                            Argentine national company, a Brazilian national company and other
                            companies. The Chilean national company has grown out of the original

                        <p>Since the beginning of the war in 1939, and perhaps for a time before,
                            the German interest on the board of trustees has been represented by
                            Swedish members but since the war England has refused visas for the
                            Swedish trustees to visit England to attend the meetings. The British
                            interests under the protection of their Government have exercised
                            control of the German interest and of a small Italian minority interest
                            and have eliminated the Swedish trustees of the <pb n="112"

                            Ltd. Consequently, Cables &amp; Wireless Ltd. now really dominates the
                            South American field. It is the same company which has assumed control
                            of all communication between England and its dominions and which the
                            Department has found obstructive in its efforts to establish
                            communications with various parts of the British Empire.</p>

                        <p>It is worthwhile to consider briefly the situation of the Argentine
                            company and of the Chilean company.</p>
                        <p rend="center">(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Argentina</hi>. 16% of the stock of the company is held
                            by the public in Argentina. 65% of the bonds are held in Argentina.
                            There is a small (4%) Italian and (5%) German interest in the Argentine
                            company. Furthermore, there is an Italian as well as a German
                            representative on the committee which operates the Argentine station.
                            There are also on the committee representatives of the French, British
                            and American ownership.</p>
                        <p>The composition of the committee operating the company and the
                            considerable local financial interest in the company are questions which
                            have to be considered for they present possibilities of internal
                            difficulty for the Argentine Government even if it desired to close the
                            station to Axis communications. It could probably not do so without
                            incurring the enmity of some of its important financial groups.
                            Furthermore, the Italian and German membership on the operating
                            committee lead immediately to the idea of pressure being brought to bear
                            from the German and Italian Governments through their embassies in
                            Argentina.</p>
                        <p>In Argentina there are three companies operating radio stations:</p>

                            been opened as a direct result of the imposition of censorship in the
                            United States, and through them there is an increasing traffic which up
                            to the time of their opening had been routed through the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>(2) The International Radio Company (I. T. &amp; T.—Mackay) of Argentina
                            has only one circuit and operates from B. A. to New York.</p>
                        <p>(3) The Sociedad Anónima Radio Argentina, (also I. T. &amp; T.), has only
                            one beam to Europe which is to Madrid, its only other European beam to
                            Prague having been closed.</p>
                        <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0125"/>
                        <p>Of the three companies operating in B. A., the Consortium station is the
                            most important for it connects Rome, Berlin, and Tokyo directly, and it
                            has a supplementary route through Santiago for its line to Tokyo and it
                            can collect from Rio, Asuncion, La Paz, and Lima messages for relay to
                            Rome, Tokyo, or Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances which exist in Buenos Aires, it would be more
                            difficult for the Argentine Government to close the station than if
                            there was no public Argentine ownership of either stocks or bonds or if
                            the committee were simply an American or a British or a joint American
                            and British effort.</p>
                        <p rend="center">(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chile</hi>. The situation in Santiago is quite
                            different from that in Buenos Aires. There are small German, French,
                            British, American and only 1% Chilean ownership under a 60% Consortium
                            (Trust) stock control. There are no outstanding bonds. Consequently, the
                            selfish interest of gain does not appear in Santiago. There is no
                            financial investment of Chilean money in the enterprise. There is no
                            Italian ownership and no Italian membership on the local operating
                            committee. There is French membership and German membership on that
                            committee. Opposition in Chile would come from the small German stock
                            ownership amounting to 11% and the presence of a German on the operating
                            committee, but opposition would immediately be manifested by Japan also,
                            for Chile sends to and receives from Tokyo. B. A. is the only other
                            radiotelegraph circuit Japan has in South America and the importance of
                            each station to Japan is obvious.</p>
                        <p>In Chile there are only two stations: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The I. T. &amp; T. subsidiary communicates between New York
                                    and Santiago only.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>The Consortium station has beams to Berlin, Tokyo, Lima, Rio,
                                    and B. A., as well as London and New York. We are now advised a
                                    new telephoto service is to be inaugurated between Santiago and
                                    Tokyo.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>It is quite possible that if the Consortium station at B. A. were shut
                            down that the beams now used by it might be transferred to the
                            Consortium company at Santiago and its less important circuits would
                            thereby be built up into a communicating system which would rival or
                            even surpass that of B. A. The equipment is there and could easily be
                            used, so that in spite of the present comparative unimportance of the
                            Santiago Consortium station, it is just as important that it be closed
                            as that the B. A. Consortium station be closed.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, threats and pressure from Japan may be expected in Santiago
                            if the closing of the circuit is to be debated. It would be called “an
                            unfriendly act” and various other statements would be made to frighten
                            Chile into maintaining communication.</p>
                        <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0126"/>
                        <p rend="center">(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</p>
                        <p>So it would appear there will be need for intelligent pressure by the
                            United States on the governments at each of these capitals to persuade
                            them to discontinue communication with the Axis. Failure to achieve
                            closure after the exertion of pressure would be unfortunate.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, it would seem very important to secure the closing of
                            stations in both countries for the reason that if one were left open
                            there would be (1) constant effort on the part of the other to reopen,
                            and (2) an importance of increasing magnitude in the one remaining open
                            as it would be developed into a single line of communication between the
                            Axis powers and their South American agents and would be treated by the
                            Axis powers as a major matter. The government of the particular country
                            concerned would be the object of Axis attentions to whatever point the
                            Axis powers felt it advisable to go in order to retain the circuit in
                            operation.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III</p>
                        <p>From our point of view situations differ in each country in that
                            different reasons appear as probable to develop locally as the basis for
                            the objection by each country to closing their respective circuits. In
                            Argentina it is apt to be largely native financial opposition
                            supplemented by German influence. In Chile, international political
                            considerations would seem to be the principal basis upon which
                            opposition to our desires would develop.</p>
                        <p>However, it ought not be overlooked that, since the closing of the
                            station in Lima, Argentina and Chile remain the only places in this
                            hemisphere in direct communication with Axis powers. The traffic which
                            formerly flowed through other stations is now flowing through those two.
                            Each of them is assuming an importance it did not have before. Largely
                            due to this increasing importance there may develop a hostility nurtured
                            by a sense of growing importance and directed against the movement to
                            close the circuits. It is certain that if only one of the countries
                            remains in communication with the enemy that the combined force of the
                            enemy in the way of propaganda and threats of all kinds will be brought
                            into play against that country and we may have to resort to unusual
                            lengths in giving assurances in order to offset the threats of the
                            Axis.</p>
                        <p>The gist of our information is that different reasons will appear in each
                            of the two countries for maintaining the circuits open in spite of our
                            desires.</p>
                        <p>To the same effect apparently is the British judgment for Cables &amp;
                            Wireless Ltd. has recently advised (London’s 1812, April 13, 8 p.m.<note
                                n="12" xml:id="d81fn12">Not printed.</note>) that there are
                            difficulties in the way of their arranging a discontinuance <pb n="115"
                                xml:id="pg_115" facs="0127"/>of radio communication by the Argentine
                            company and by the Chilean company. The difficulties are stated to be
                            local in each country. They suggest that the only way of accomplishing
                            the object in view is for the Government of the United States to ask the
                            South American republics to conform to Resolution XL of the Rio
                            Conference by issuing suitable orders to the companies operating in
                            their respective jurisdictions.</p>

                        <p>There is no intimation that they (Cables &amp; Wireless) would cooperate
                            to that end—nor is there any assurance that they would not obstruct the
                            movement for financial reasons as they have in so many instances in

                        <p>616. In the interest of common hemispheric defense it is essential that
                            communications between this hemisphere and the Axis powers be completely

                            immediate measures to close all radiotelephone and radiotelegraph
                            communications between the American Republics and the Axis powers.</p>
                        <p>The other American Republics have for all practical purposes closed
                            channels of communication between their countries and the Axis powers
                            and it is believed that at this time Argentina and Chile remain the only
                            places in this hemisphere with radio stations in direct communication
                            with the Axis powers. The traffic which formerly flowed through other
                            stations is now flowing through stations in these two countries, as a
                            result of which each is assuming an importance it did not have before.
                            The three companies operating radio stations in Argentina are the
                            consortium, the International Radio Company (the I. T. &amp; T.—Mackay)
                            and the Sociedad Anónima Radio Argentina (also I. T. &amp; T.). The
                            closing of the consortium station as far as Axis communications is
                            concerned might present possibilities of internal difficulties for the
                            Argentine Government in view of the fact that 16% of the stock is held
                            by the public in Argentina and that the operating committee includes
                            Italian and German membership which might cause the German and Italian
                            Governments to bring pressure to bear upon the Argentine Government.</p>

                        <p>However, as already stated, it is essential in the interest of the common
                            defense that these Argentine stations, as well as the stations in Chile,
                            be closed to Axis communications. Various ways of bringing this about
                            are at present being studied by the Department but before taking any

                        <p>491. In the interest of common hemispheric defense it is essential that
                            communications between this hemisphere and the Axis powers be completely
                            severed. With this end in view Resolution XL of the Rio conference
                            provided that each American Republic should adopt necessary and
                            immediate measures to close all radiotelephone and radiotelegraph
                            communications between the American Republics and the Axis powers.</p>
                        <p>The other American Republics have for all practical purposes closed
                            channels of communication between their countries and the Axis powers
                            and it is believed that at this time Argentina and Chile remain the only
                            places in this hemisphere with radio stations in direct communication
                            with the Axis powers. The traffic which formerly flowed through other
                            stations is now flowing through stations in these two countries, as a
                            result of which each is assuming an importance it did not have before.
                            There are two companies in Chile operating radio stations: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The I. T. &amp; T. subsidiary communicates between New York
                                    and Santiago only.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>The consortium station has beams to Berlin, Tokyo, Lima, Rio,
                                    and Buenos Aires, as well as London and New York. We are now
                                    advised a new telephoto service is to be inaugurated between
                                    Santiago and Tokyo.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>It is quite possible that if the consortium station at Buenos Aires were
                            shut down the beams now used by it might be transferred to the
                            consortium company at Santiago and its less important circuits would
                            thereby be built up into a communicating system which would rival or
                            even surpass that of Buenos Aires. The equipment is there and could
                            easily be used, so that in spite of the present comparative unimportance
                            of the Santiago consortium station, it is just as important that it be
                            closed as that the Buenos Aires consortium station be closed.</p>
                        <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0130"/>
                        <p>Consequently, threats and pressure from Japan may be expected in Santiago
                            if the closing of the circuit is to be debated. It would be called “an
                            unfriendly act” and various other statements would be made to frighten
                            Chile into maintaining communication.</p>
                        <p>However, as already stated, it is essential in the interest of the common
                            defense that these Chilean stations, as well as the stations in
                            Argentina, be closed to Axis communications. Various ways of bringing

                        <p>858. Department’s telegram 616, May 2. Matter in general has been
                            discussed repeatedly with Foreign Office and although there is certain
                            compliance with sections 2 and 3 of Resolution XV [<hi rend="italic"
                                >XL?</hi>] there is no evidence of intention to cooperate with
                            respect to section 1. Possibly Argentina can eventually be persuaded to
                            comply if it can be shown that all other American Republics have
                            definitely done so.</p>
                        <p>Local American companies are of opinion that severing Axis communications
                            is very difficult, since messages would be relayed through <pb n="119"
                                xml:id="pg_119" facs="0131"/>Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Portugal or
                            other so-called neutrals. This excuse probably would be offered by
                            Argentine authorities for not taking such action. Embassy would
                            appreciate any information which would help combat this argument.</p>
                        <p>Regarding trans-radio consortium, it claims to be under American and
                            British control. It is believed that some progress toward Argentine
                            compliance could be achieved by convincing American affiliates of all
                            three companies mentioned in Department’s telegram as to necessity for
                            such action.</p>

                            them under control. Irrespective of this fact, I think, and for months
                            have thought, that the attempt should be made or that the other
                            governments of South America should be requested to withhold telegrams
                            to B. A. and Santiago intended for enemy destination.</p>

                            just <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0132"/>arrived in this country
                            again. He has blocked direct communication between us and South Africa.
                            He is prepared to give lip service to closing the stations down there
                            but will not do so unless his Government directs it. His Government has
                            eliminated the influence of Beaverbrook in communication matters. My
                            recent information is that Cables and Wireless has driven a wedge
                            between Beaverbrook and the Government, due very probably to his
                            favorable attitude to our suggestions. Nevertheless, Beaverbrook is now,
                            temporarily at least, divorced from any authority over communications.
                            Campbell insists that he is not subordinate to Downing Street and that
                            he is the head of a communicating system established by Parliament and
                            co-extensive with the Empire. The British Embassy here will not
                            recognize him, probably for two reasons: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) he
                            does not want to be subordinate to the Ambassador, and (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) it serves the interests of the British Empire
                            to have Campbell Stuart operating independently. He recently sent word
                            to me that he would like to talk to me during the coming week. I replied
                            that I would be glad to see him but that I hoped that he would come with
                            the authority of the British Embassy. Without authority from the Embassy
                            for him to negotiate it is difficult to secure the cooperation of the
                            British Government.</p>
                        <p>Because of the independent authority of this particular individual, the
                            efforts that I have made for more than twelve months have been very
                            difficult of successful prosecution and in certain respects frustrated.
                            The frustrated attempts are B. A., Santiago, and Pretoria. In spite of
                            his opposition we have succeeded in establishing telecommunications or
                            permission for telecommunications of various kinds with Cairo, Baghdad,
                            Lagos, Bathurst, Australia—two circuits, Wellington—two circuits, New
                            Delhi (if equipment is furnished—which is not really needed), and
                            Singapore and Rangoon too late.</p>
                        <p>The principle difficulties remain with Pretoria having just refused and
                            having frankly stated in one paragraph that it was due to Cables and
                            Wireless and their disinclination to lose the revenue because of
                            rerouted traffic. The other two unsolved difficulties are Santiago and
                            B. A.</p>
                        <p>The only way that I know to stop them is for the British Government
                            itself to control its own creatures, that is, Cables and Wireless,
                            Limited, as presently directed, and to tell them that revenue or no
                            revenue they are to cease communications with the Axis powers out of B.
                            A. and Santiago.</p>
                        <p>That can be done through the mediation of Halifax<note n="26"

                        <p>If that is done, and if thereafter the Governments of Argentina and Chile
                            desire to communicate on their own with the Axis, we will have <pb

                                printed.</note> The telecommunication circuits that Chile is
                            maintaining with enemy territory are being used to transmit to the Axis
                            vital information from all parts of the hemisphere regarding movements
                            of ships, individually and in convoy. We have confidential information
                            to bear this out. This may result in a situation in which political
                            considerations will have to be weighed against paramount military
                            considerations.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean Government should immediately be impressed with the serious
                            view which this Government takes of a situation in which nations that
                            have solemnly agreed to stand together in the joint defense of the
                            hemisphere operate and insist upon maintaining facilities whereby the
                            enemy is enabled to destroy the lives and property of citizens of the
                            American Republics and to interrupt lines of communication indispensable
                            to their common defense. Shipping no less vital to the survival of Chile
                            than to that of the United States is being lost every day because the
                            Chilean Government has failed to cut off the channels through which the
                            Axis is given information without which it could not successfully
                            maintain this attack on the vital communications of all the American
                            republics. The prompt action whereby 19 of the republics have already
                            severed direct communication with Axis territory is in large part
                            nullified by the failure of Chile and Argentina to do likewise.</p>
                        <p>The Department is now considering the possibility of bringing about
                            action the result of which would be to have the Consortium in which the
                            British and United States interests are dominant and the I. T. &amp; T.
                            subsidiary in Argentina abandon their circuits with the Axis. Were the
                            Chilean circuits to be abandoned, how great do you think the possibility
                            is that the Chilean Government would then proceed to operate the
                            circuits itself or to transfer them for operation to other private
                            interests?</p>
                        <p>Please telegraph the Department your views both with respect to further
                            action that might be taken to induce the Chilean Government to abandon
                            these telecommunication circuits and with regard to the <pb n="122"

                                Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> this afternoon at my house set
                            forth a plan he mentioned to me Saturday at lunch that he is prepared to
                            inform the Missions of Germany, Italy and Japan that they no longer can
                            communicate with their Governments in code and he thinks this will lead
                            to a controversy eventuating in the breaking of relations. He wants to
                            know if we will take this as proof that a pretext is being sought and
                            with a certainty of finding it soon with the intention of breaking
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>It seems a big step forward. Sentiment here is changing so rapidly and is
                            becoming so strong for breaking relations that I dare entertain the
                            expectation that it is certain to come very soon.</p>
                        <p>In this connection he tells me he has just heard from his Ambassador in
                            Washington that you had told him Chile could expect nothing more from us
                            until relations are broken. He is to make an exposition on foreign
                            affairs before Congress tomorrow and would prefer not to mention this
                            ultimatum at that time since he says it would create an opposition in
                            quarters where it does not exist. I am persuaded that he now knows that
                            relations must be broken and that he is really searching for a pretext
                            on which he can break without imperiling his personal prestige. Since
                            outside this one phase he is strongly pro-American and pro-Ally this
                            would be satisfactory to me. Your plain statement to Michels<note n="31"

                        <p>Last night 10,000 people attended a homage to Mexico because of the war
                            and with misgivings I agreed to attend on the stipulation that no
                            attacks be made on the Government directly. None were made and I
                            received a great ovation. The leaders of all parties that supported
                                Ríos<note n="32" xml:id="d88fn32">Juan Antonio Ríos, President of

                            vigorously on the side of complete alignment with the Allies. Marcella
                            Mora, leader of the radicals, made a strong speech. It gives an impetus
                            to public opinion forming in our favor.</p>

                            received shows total 26,800 messages sent from Buenos Aires November and
                            26,300 May, with 27,700 received November and 24,400 May. Comparing May
                            with previous November, there was substantial decline in messages to and
                            from the United States, and slight total decline both to and from South
                            American countries. Substantial increase in total messages sent Europe
                            in May, but number received about the same. Spain, Germany, Italy,
                            Switzerland, Sweden show largest gains in messages sent from here in
                            May, although this partly ascribed to present inadequate air mail
                            facilities which existed last November. Messages sent to Japan total 510
                            November, 622 May; received 425 November, 420 May.</p>

                            and Japan, partly due to its direct circuits and more complete

                        <p>Mr. Long told Colonel Sarnoff that he was getting more perturbed every
                            day by the continued operation of the consortium circuits between
                            Argentina and Chile and Berlin and Tokyo. These circuits were being used
                            for the transmission of vital information regarding ship movements,
                            cargoes, and general intelligence. The closing of these circuits
                            required the cooperation of the British interests. Despite conversations
                            between Mr. Hopkins and Lord Beaverbrook, at the time of Mr. Churchill’s
                            first visit<note n="39" xml:id="d90fn39">Prime Minister Churchill came

                            attitude by the British interests, these interests have so far been
                            reluctant to take any affirmative action other than to close the station
                            at Rio. As a result of developments elsewhere, the possibilities of
                            British cooperation seem better. Sir Campbell Stuart, in a recent
                            meeting, expressed ignorance of the discussions last winter regarding
                            the closure of the circuits with Argentina and Chile but stated that he
                            would be glad to go into the matter fully after his return from a trip
                            to Canada. A meeting has been arranged for Monday, July 6 at 3:00 p.m.
                            Mr. Long expressed the hope that Colonel Sarnoff would be able to attend
                            that meeting. General Davis and Mr. Winterbottom<note n="40"
                                xml:id="d90fn40">W. A. Winterbottom, vice president and general

                            attend the meeting.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Sarnoff said that he was prepared to do whatever was necessary.
                            Speaking without having given any previous thought to the matter, he
                            believed that there were various alternatives. The first was for the
                            Argentine and Chilean Governments to take over the stations themselves.
                            The RCA had no objection to this. On the contrary, it had favored such
                            action by the Argentine Government about two years ago. The I. T. &amp;
                            T. blocked the deal.</p>
                        <p>The second alternative was for the United States and British interests to
                            place in the stations reliable personnel experts in cryptography, et
                            cetera, who could detect whether the circuits were being used for the
                            transmission of intelligence to the enemy. He would be glad to send
                            General Davis on a trip to Argentina to look into the situation if that
                            was desirable. Colonel Sarnoff stated that he, of course, would be glad
                            to attend the meeting on Monday afternoon provided that he could return
                            in time from a detail on which he was being sent to Florida. In his wide
                            experience, Sir Campbell Stuart was the only man whom he had never been
                            able satisfactorily to size up. He was the acme of courtesy but always
                            turned up as the man behind the scenes blocking the extension of the RCA
                            service.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Long permitted Colonel Sarnoff to look over the list of
                            unsatisfactory personnel as obtained from the Embassy at Buenos Aires. …
                            Colonel Sarnoff thought that there was no reason for delaying any
                            further in getting rid of any undesirable employees. He thought that
                            this was a first step which should be taken regardless of action with
                            regard to severance of communications. In fact, he thought that with
                            code experts in the stations it would be possible to ascertain what the
                            Axis was sending back and forth.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Duggan stated that he had always been informed by the competent
                            authorities of this Government that what was desired was the complete
                            severance of these circuits since it was always possible to arrange the
                            most innocent code for the sending of highly important messages.</p>
                        <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0138"/>
                        <p>Colonel Sarnoff said that, of course, the Axis could always continue to
                            transmit information via neutral countries. This would be more difficult
                            but nevertheless entirely feasible.</p>

                        <p>1069. In reply to the question in the third paragraph of the Department’s
                            680 of June 13, 4 p.m., I am of the opinion that at this moment the
                            Chilean Government would proceed to operate the circuits itself since it
                            is not prepared at present to entirely cut off telecommunications with
                            the Axis Powers. It is, however, apparently prepared to forbid code
                            messages being sent over telecommunication circuits to Axis countries
                            but is awaiting the Department’s reply to the tentative proposal to that
                            effect, transmitted in my 1021 of June 22, 7 p.m. May I suggest that I
                            be authorized to say that the Department thinks that the prohibition of
                            code messages to Axis regions would be a decided step in the direction
                            of continental defense.</p>

                        <p>3046. Meeting is being arranged Monday July 6 with Sir Campbell Stuart
                            and representatives of RCA to discuss the closing of the circuits to
                            Axis countries operated by consortium stations at Buenos Aires and
                            Santiago. As a result of concerted action by the various American
                            Republics, the United States and the American companies concerned,
                            direct telecommunications between the other American Republics and the
                            Axis have been shut down with the exception of the two stations
                            mentioned above and I. T. &amp; T. radio-telephone station in Buenos
                            Aires. It is possible, of course, that should the consortium stations
                            close their Axis circuits the Argentine and Chilean Governments might
                            establish circuits of their own. It is believed, however, that at this
                            time it is psychologically bad, not to say incongruous, for British and
                            American communication companies to allow stations over which they have
                            the control and in which they have a financial interest to facilitate
                            the stream of intelligence between South America and the Axis so
                            detrimental to the best interests of Great Britain, the United States
                            and the other United Nations.</p>

                            possible concerning the trust which operates the consortium station
                            whose seat is in London, the personnel thereof, the exact relation

                            whether and if so how the German interest in the trust has been taken

                            interests in the trust, and in general the attitude of British interests

                            circuits. In all your dealings with British officials and company
                            representatives, you should constantly emphasize the fact that the
                            closing of Axis circuits to Latin America is a vital factor in the
                            campaign to end submarine warfare in the waters of this Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>Please give this matter your most urgent and careful attention.</p>

                        <p>3116. Your 3721, July 4, 9 p.m.<note n="41" xml:id="d93fn41">Not
                                printed.</note> Conference took place in Department yesterday at
                            which were present the British Chargé d’Affaires, Sir R. I. Campbell,
                            Sir Campbell Stuart, and representatives of RCA, including Colonel
                            Sarnoff and Mr. Winterbottom, and General Davis, Chairman of the
                            Consortium Trust.</p>
                        <p>In view of the situation in Argentina and Chile and in consideration of
                            the fact that the consortium stations in those countries continue to
                            carry traffic to and from Axis countries, it had become apparent that
                            nothing short of positive joint action by the British and United States
                            consortium trustees under the direction of their respective governments
                            would result in the ultimate closing of these major circuits to enemy
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the above meeting was called mainly for the purpose of
                            reaching a mutual agreement upon which a unified course of action could
                            be taken with regard to Argentina and Chile.</p>
                        <p>It was unanimously agreed at the meeting that RCA would request the
                            Secretary of the Consortium Trust, whose office is in London,
                            immediately to call a meeting in New York of the trustees for the
                            purpose of arriving at a formal agreement under the consortium bylaws
                            which would result in the closing of the consortium circuits in
                            Argentina and Chile to outgoing and incoming messages from enemy
                            countries. In addition, it is contemplated that such a decision <pb
                                n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0140"/>by a majority vote of the
                            consortium would be followed by prompt action to eliminate all pro-Axis
                            sympathizers and agents from the directorates or working personnel of
                            the Argentine and Chilean companies.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the calling in New York of the above-mentioned meeting
                            the Department is keeping in mind the fact that if the German trustees
                            are represented it would appear likely that Swedish proxies will be used
                            or, if the French trustees accept an invitation to attend the meeting,
                            they may be empowered by the Germans to vote in their behalf.</p>
                        <p>During the conference mentioned in paragraph 1 it was the consensus that
                            even if Germany and France were represented and voted against the action
                            which we contemplate in Argentina and Chile, the deciding vote could be
                            cast by General Davis, the American Chairman. This procedure would be in
                            line with the consortium bylaws which the Department would prefer to
                            adhere to as closely as possible in order to avoid the claim of
                            illegality which it is reasonable to assume will be raised by the
                            Germans in Santiago and Buenos Aires.</p>
                        <p>In view of the above you are instructed promptly to discuss the matter
                            with the Foreign Office and strongly to urge that the British Government
                            lend every assistance in the carrying out of the above plan. In order to
                            expedite matters it might be well to suggest that the Department has
                            discussed with Sir Ronald Campbell and Sir Campbell Stuart the
                            possibility that Wilshaw and Inverforth<note n="42" xml:id="d93fn42"

                            two persons already in this country, possibly from the Embassy, to act
                            as their alternates. Also, you are authorized to suggest that the
                            British Government promptly transmit to its representatives in Buenos
                            Aires and Santiago confidential advice of the above plan. Please keep
                            the Department currently informed of developments.</p>

                        <p>796. The Argentine Minister of the Interior today issued
                                instructions<note n="46" xml:id="d95fn46">See <hi rend="italic"
                                    >supra.</hi></note> for the complete implementation of all
                            provisions of Rio Resolution XL. When these instructions are carried
                            out, Chile will be the sole remaining nation of the Western Hemisphere
                            through which intelligence detrimental to continental defense is
                            permitted to flow to the Axis. Consequently, it is more urgent than ever
                            before that Chile take action to sever the telecommunication circuits
                            which it now maintains with Axis territory. By continuing to maintain
                            them it will in large part nullify the effectiveness of the action taken
                            by the other American republics, since it will provide a channel that
                            may be used by Axis agents throughout the hemisphere. Please bring this
                            matter again to the attention of the foreign office and telegraph what
                            measures, if any, have so far been adopted by the Chilean Government in
                            accordance with the aforesaid resolution; and what reasons are advanced
                            by the foreign office for failure to sever telecommunication circuits
                            with the Axis.</p>

                            first presented orally the matter of closing Chilean telecommunication
                            circuits to the Foreign Minister and followed it up on July 13 with a
                            written communication to the Foreign Minister, copy of which is
                            enclosed, to which I received a reply on July 14, a translation of which
                            is also enclosed.</p>
                        <p>Taking my cue from the statement in the last paragraph of the Minister’s

                            circuits the Chilean Government would take prompt action, I went to see
                            the Foreign Minister today and allowed him to see translations of
                            intercepted telegrams from the German Embassy transmitted over
                            authorized Chilean telecommunication circuits, which contained not only
                            information dangerous to hemispheric defense but proof of subversive
                            activities of the German Ambassador and members of his staff as well. A
                            copy of my oral remarks to the Foreign Minister is enclosed.<note n="48"
                                xml:id="d96fn49">Not printed.</note> It will be seen therefrom, and
                            from my telegram No. 1170 of July 17, 6 p.m., that he expressed himself
                            as convinced of there having been misuse of the radio circuits and
                            misuse of diplomatic immunities by members of the staff of the Embassy
                            and said that he was considering the matter with the President. He
                            referred to his inquiry whether prohibiting the sending of code messages
                            by Axis Embassies would be regarded in the nature of a solution by us
                            and expressed surprise that he had not received my communication to him
                            of July 13 in which I stated that such action would be helpful in
                            decreasing the dangers to our cause of maintenance of these circuits. I
                            have sent him a replacement copy of this communication.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Minister</hi>: I have the honor to
                                refer to our recent conversation in which, under instructions from
                                my Government, I informed you that the telecommunication connections
                                which Chile maintains with Axis territory were being employed to
                                carry to the Axis Governments information of vital importance from
                                all parts of this hemisphere with respect to the movements of
                                individual ships and ships in convoys, and that we had confidential
                                information bearing this out.</p>
                            <p>I have now again been instructed by my Government to bring to your
                                attention the serious concern with which my Government views the
                                continued <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0143"/>operation of
                                facilities whereby the enemy is able to interrupt the lines of
                                communication indispensable to the common defense of the American
                                Republics and to destroy the lives and property of citizens of these
                                Republics. My Government feels that shipping, which is just as vital
                                for the survival of Chile as that of the United States, is daily
                                being lost because of Chile’s maintenance of the channels through
                                which the Axis is provided information without which it would not be
                                able successfully to maintain its attacks on the vital
                                communications of the various American Republics.</p>
                            <p>In effect, my government has felt that the prompt action of nineteen
                                of the American Republics in severing direct communications with
                                territory under the control of the Axis is nullified to a large
                                extent by the fact that Chile and Argentina have not taken similar
                                measures.</p>
                            <p>Since our conversation, I have been informed by my Government that
                                the Argentine Minister of the Interior on July 11th issued
                                instructions that all of the provisions of Resolution No. XL of the
                                Conference at Rio de Janeiro shall be completely implemented. With
                                the execution of the instructions of the Argentine Minister of the
                                Interior, Chile would therefore be the only nation remaining in the
                                Western Hemisphere through which military intelligence detrimental
                                to hemispheric defense would be permitted to flow to the Axis.</p>
                            <p>My Government therefore asks me to convey its views that it is more
                                urgent than ever before that Chile undertake action to sever the
                                telecommunications circuits which it now maintains with Axis
                                territory since their continued operation would provide a channel
                                that might be used by Axis agents throughout the hemisphere.</p>
                            <p>Believe me [etc.]</p>

                                conversations concerning the use of telecommunication between this
                                country and those of the Axis.</p>
                            <p>Because of these conversations this Ministry has concerned itself,
                                with every interest, to consider with the Ministry of the Interior,

                                view which Your Excellency has expressed to me, for following with
                                the same interest the consideration of the matter in order to take
                                adequate measures which I shall shortly have the pleasure of making

                            <p>I must also express to Your Excellency that, if there are sufficient
                                reasons to assure that, under the regime concerning
                                telecommunications existing up to now—which is not one of absolute
                                and unconditional liberty—it has been possible really to commit the
                                abuses to which Your Excellency refers and should this Ministry have
                                concrete antecedents respecting the matter, the application of the
                                corresponding measures and sanctions will be hastened.</p>

                            that it does not consider the denial of the use of codes by Axis
                            missions as an alternative to cutting the circuits with Axis territory.
                            While the Department would be gratified by the denial of <pb n="133"
                                xml:id="pg_133" facs="0145"/>the use of codes to the Axis missions

                        <p>1103. 1. A meeting was held in Department on July 20 attended by
                            representatives of RCA, Sir Campbell Stuart and General Robert C. Davis,
                            chairman of the consortium trust.</p>
                        <p>2. It was decided to call a meeting of the trustees at New York City
                            August 24 “to review position of consortium companies in present world
                            situation.” Notice of this meeting is being sent to the German trustees
                            through their Swedish representatives at Stockholm by the intermediary
                            of the American Legation at that city and to the French trustees by the
                            intermediary of the American Consul at Lyon.</p>
                        <p>3. It was further decided that General Davis should proceed to Buenos
                            Aires and Santiago on July 28 accompanied by two Government radio
                            experts to examine the questions of closing the consortium circuits to
                            the Axis and of removing undesirable personnel from the stations. He
                            would return to New York in time for the meeting of August 24 to submit

                                p.m.,<note n="52" xml:id="d101fn52">Not printed; this telegram gave

                                that it close the existing telecommunication circuits with the Axis
                                (810.74/383c).</note> were duly conveyed to the Foreign Office. In
                            accordance with our request the latter have instructed their Embassies
                            at Buenos Aires and Santiago to afford all possible assistance to
                            General Davis. In addition they say that they have kept the aforesaid
                            Embassies informed of all developments. They say that while we may rest
                            assured that General Davis will be given the fullest support in dealing
                            with the Chilean authorities, it seems “a little premature” to make
                            formal representations to the Chilean Government in advance of the
                            report which General Davis is expected to make.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing it would be helpful, if the Department desires
                            that British representations be made at Santiago prior to General Davis’
                            survey of the situation, if the Embassy could be furnished with more
                            detailed background information.</p>
                        <p>(While the Foreign Office fully shares our views as to the desirability
                            of severing communications between the Axis countries and Argentina and
                            Chile, they are at present inclined to feel that steps to that end
                            through the Consortium Trust Affiliates in the latter countries would
                            only result in their substitution by purely Axis controlled
                            communications companies with the added disadvantage that we would not
                            as at present be able to obtain complete and highly useful knowledge of
                            the messages which are being sent. This is however only a preliminary
                            view and if we can convince the Foreign Office and other interested
                            authorities of the greater advantages of attempting to close down the
                            Corsortium Trust Affiliates they are quite prepared to cooperate).</p>

                        <p>3841. Your 4321, August 3, 5 p.m. Department has felt that both in
                            Argentina and Chile action by the governments to cut the circuits with
                            Axis territory would be more definitive and less likely to create
                            confusion and ill will than action by the consortium interests that
                            would have to be taken without the concurrence of the governments and
                            possibly in violation of the concessions under which the companies
                            operate. Preparation for action by the consortium is being made only
                            because of the likelihood that this is the only means of achieving this
                            important objective in the near future. Nevertheless, our Embassies in
                            Buenos Aires and Santiago are continuing, on every appropriate occasion,
                            their representations to the governments, and there appears to be a
                            possibility that these representations will succeed. Our Embassy in
                            Chile feels that this possibility would be definitely increased, with
                            regard to the Chilean Government, if the British Embassy in Santiago
                            should likewise inform the Foreign Office there that it has evidence
                            that the existing telecommunication circuits with the Axis are being
                            wrongly used. It feels that otherwise the non-rupture element in the
                            Chilean Cabinet will argue against cutting the circuit, pointing out
                            that the British have made no objection to its continuation.</p>
                        <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0148"/>
                        <p>Should the circuits be closed by action of the consortium, it is possible
                            though far from certain that the local governments would continue them
                            under other auspices. This would, however, represent positive action by
                            them in opposition to recommendations of the Rio Meeting which they
                            would probably be reluctant to take. In any case, there are no “purely
                            Axis-controlled communications companies” in either Argentina or
                            Chile.</p>

                            came in this afternoon and I advised him of the report made at
                            yesterday’s meeting by General Davis concerning his activities on his
                            trip to Rio, B. A., and Santiago, and said that the report seemed to
                            indicate that there was a satisfactory condition now existing in those
                            three capitals and that the communication facilities of the Consortium
                            group in each of those capitals was now in friendly hands. I related to
                            him in some detail the report made by General Davis in connection with
                            each of the three stations.</p>
                        <p>I further told Sir Ronald that General Davis had not been able to
                            determine whether the British Ambassador in Santiago had received
                            instructions to cooperate with him and with the American Ambassador
                            although General Davis assumed he had received instructions and that his
                            manner was that of an astute diplomat who could carry on a conversation
                            without making any commitment. I added that I thought it would be
                            helpful, in case he had not received instructions, for him to receive
                            them. Sir Ronald said he would check up and see that that was done if
                            the Ambassador had not already been instructed.</p>

                        <p>982. This Government is deeply disturbed at the fact that the Government
                            of Chile continues to maintain telecommunication circuits with the Axis.
                            By doing so, it upholds the hands of the Axis in its struggle to
                            overcome the free peoples of the American continent. The information
                            that is supplied to the Axis by the channels which Chile keeps open
                            makes as material a contribution to the Axis cause as if Chile were
                            supplying the Axis armed forces with the actual materials of war. It may
                            be measured in terms of the torpedoes that are sinking the ships and
                            thereby disrupting the vital communications of the American
                            republics.</p>
                        <p>The Department, taking cognizance of frequent verbal assurances of
                            complete solidarity and cooperation on the part of the Chilean
                            Government, feels sure that President Ríos and the Foreign Minister
                            would not continue to countenance this extension of aid to the Axis if
                            they were fully aware of the wounds being inflicted on the entire
                            American community of nations as a result of it. The Department’s
                            assurance is reinforced by the Foreign Minister’s statement that, if we
                            presented proof (as we have done) of the misuse of the Axis circuits,
                            the Chilean Government would take prompt action to remedy the situation.
                            The Department feels that time is of the essence in remedying it.</p>
                        <p>You should find an immediate opportunity to impress this situation anew
                            upon President Ríos, reporting to the Department the results of your
                            representations.</p>

                        <p>1421. For Secretary and Under Secretary. Your telegram 982, August 29, 6
                            p.m. finally reached the President. It was evident that he has been
                            confused and through the failure of Barros Jarpa to inform him. He
                            reiterated his readiness to do whatever we think necessary for the
                            protection of the Americas and his determination that Chile shall not be
                            used against them. When I told him the German Embassy’s wires have
                            increased 216% since 1941 he was astonished and said that since none
                            could deal with commercial matters it seemed very strange. I then showed
                            him a selected number of intercepts showing what is going out on war
                            matters from German Embassy. He asked if I had ever called them to the
                            attention of Barros Jarpa. When I replied that I had he seemed more than
                            ever astonished. I asked if he would like to see more and he said he
                            would.</p>
                        <p>He then amazed me by asking if I had seen the decree cutting off
                            communications with the Axis and when I said it applied to all but the
                            Axis Embassies he took issue, insisting that it did. I told him it was
                            not so interpreted. I then asked what the attitude of the Government
                            would be if the messages of these Missions were refused. <pb n="139"
                                xml:id="pg_139" facs="0151"/>He suggested that they be refused and
                            we would see what would happen. They would complain to the Government
                            which would not interfere.</p>
                        <p>It was all so clearly new to him that I finally asked if he would shut
                            down telecommunication circuits with Axis countries if we could prove to
                            him that they were being used to serve the enemy and the submarines and
                            he reiterated that he would do anything necessary to prevent Chile from
                            being used as a base of operations against the American nations. I shall
                            see him again and furnish additional proof.</p>
                        <p>To me the most depressing revelation was the evident fact that his
                            Minister has not passed on to him vital information.</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian Ambassador has not yet received instructions.<note n="57"
                                xml:id="d108fn57">In telegram No. 2635, September 8, 7 p.m., the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to refer to our
                            several previous conversations upon the subject and to inform Your
                            Excellency that my Government is deeply disturbed by the continuance of
                            telecommunication circuits between Chile and the Axis countries. The
                            information which is being supplied to the Axis by the channels which
                            Chile permits to remain open makes as substantial a contribution to the
                            Axis cause as if Chile were supplying the Axis armed forces with actual
                            war material. Its effect can be measured in terms of the torpedoes that
                            are sinking American and other vessels and thereby disrupting the vital
                            communications of the American Republics. Human lives and ships of the
                            American Republics are paying for the fact that the Axis nations can
                            send vital military and shipping information freely in secret codes over
                            the circuits maintained by the Transradio Chilena.</p>
                        <p>My Government, in view of the frequent and appreciated demonstrations of
                            Chile’s position of complete solidarity and cooperation with our cause,
                            feels certain that Your Excellency’s Government will not continue to
                            countenance this extension of aid to the Axis powers when it realizes
                            the wounds which are being inflicted on the entire American community of
                            nations as a result of it. I am accordingly, under instructions from my
                            Government, taking this occasion again to <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140"
                                facs="0152"/>bring this situation urgently to Your Excellency’s
                            attention and to express our confidence that, in accordance with
                            Resolution XL of the Conference at Río de Janeiro, Your Excellency’s
                            Government will at this time close the telecommunication circuits
                            existing between Chile and the Axis powers.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Long pointed out that after months of conversation the American
                            interests in the Consortium Trust (Radio Corporation of America) had
                            done nothing actually to bring about a closure of the circuits
                            maintained with the Axis by the Consortium companies in Argentina and
                            Chile. He said they had proved what degree of control they could
                            exercise over these companies by what had been accomplished in the
                            course of General Davis’ visit to Buenos Aires and Santiago, and that
                            consequently he had no doubt but what they could order the companies to
                            suspend the operation of the undesirable circuits. He said that the RCA
                            representatives were coming to see him at 3 p.m. today, and that he had
                            in mind telling them to do what was necessary in order to shut down the
                            circuits by midnight tomorrow (September 10).</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bonsai suggested the advisability of informing the Argentine and
                            Chilean Governments in advance of the contemplated action, pointing out
                            that the political consequences of doing otherwise might have wide
                            ramifications involving the basic policy governing our relations with
                            the two republics. Specifically, he said, action taken by the companies
                            in response to an initiative from this Government to close the circuits
                            might raise the whole question of control by national governments over
                            public utilities operating within their own <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141"
                                facs="0153"/>jurisdiction. He felt that one of the consequences
                            might be that nationalistic interests would point out that the public
                            services in these countries were controlled by Washington, rather than
                            by the national governments which should properly have jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Long expressed the view that, should the Governments be notified of
                            the proposed action in advance, they would immediately call in the Axis
                            representatives and that then we would have a fight on our hands. Mr.
                            Bonsai felt that, in any case, we should be much better informed than we
                            were of what the legal and political consequences of such action would
                            be before we embarked on it.</p>
                        <p>The suggestion was advanced by Messrs. Daniels and Halle that it might be
                            sufficient to have the RCA representatives be prepared to issue the
                            necessary orders immediately when the Department gives them word to go
                            ahead. This suggestion was based especially on the possibility that the
                            Chilean Government might cut the circuits in the near future on its own
                            initiative, and that since such initiative would lead the country nearer
                            to a complete diplomatic break with the Axis, it would be preferable to
                            company initiative.</p>
                        <p>The meeting thereupon adjourned to the Secretary’s Office, where Mr. Long
                            placed the problem and various considerations that had been advanced
                            before the Secretary. The Secretary, citing the vital economic
                            assistance that we were extending to Argentina, especially in the way of
                            iron and steel shipments, said that we had a right to expect a good deal
                            more cooperation in return than we were getting. He said that, while he
                            had not been in close touch with the situation in Argentina over the
                            past few months, he felt the time had come when we should deal more
                            severely with the Argentine Government. Consequently, he favored Mr.
                            Long’s proposal to ask RCA to have the circuits abandoned by midnight
                            tomorrow. Mr. Bonsai expressed his view that we should have more
                            information on the provisions of the franchises under which the
                            companies were operating before proceeding further. The Secretary said
                            that he felt the question of what the franchises provided concerned the
                            Consortium and the Consortium companies rather than this Government. It
                            was agreed that, because of indications that the Chilean Government
                            would not oppose company initiative in this matter, the Chilean
                            authorities should be notified in advance. In the case of Argentina, the
                            Secretary expressed no objection to our having the company take the
                            action forthwith.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Long gave the substance of a telegram just received from Buenos Aires
                            (1720, September 7),<note n="66" xml:id="d111fn66">Not printed.</note>
                            indicating that the Argentine Government might insist on the appointment
                            of an Argentine as Manager of Transradio Internacional,<note n="67"
                                xml:id="d111fn67">The former resident manager, a French citizen,
                                resigned in August.</note> rather than the American, George Hayes,
                            who was about to be appointed by the Board of Directors in accordance
                            with a decision taken at the meeting of Consortium trustees in New York.
                            In the course of the meeting it was decided that RCA would immediately
                            instruct its representatives on the Board of Directors to insist on
                            Hayes’ appointment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Long then requested that RCA take action to discontinue the
                            Consortium circuits with the Axis, saying that company initiative in
                            this matter would be preferable to action by the Argentine and Chilean
                            Governments as it would avoid the political issues involved. He cited
                            the recent order of the Argentine Minister of the Interior to the
                            Director of Posts and Telegraphs to implement Resolution XL of Rio, an
                            order that has not been carried out.</p>
                        <p>General Davis said the impression he had gathered on his recent trip was
                            that our Embassies in Argentina and Chile were in accord that if the
                            companies close the circuits on their own initiative, the governments
                            might take them over. He thus explained the wording of the minutes of
                            the recent trustees meeting in which the trustees had gone on record as
                            approving any action the companies might take in accordance with any
                            “suggestion” from the governments that they abandon any international
                            circuits they were operating.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bonsai raised the question of whether the franchises under which the
                            companies were operating their Axis circuits actually did not allow them
                            to abandon those circuits without permission of the governments. Neither
                            General Davis nor Colonel Sarnoff could give a categorical answer, but
                            the General expressed his belief that reason had to be given to the
                            governments for taking such action.</p>
                        <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0155"/>
                        <p>Colonel Sarnoff said that, speaking for RCA, he would gladly waive
                            consideration of the commercial interests at stake. He said the only
                            question was whether RCA had it in its power to achieve the desired end.
                            He pointed out that first the British Consortium interests would have to
                            concur in the proposed action. If they did so, the question would arise
                            as to whether the trustees had the requisite authority. If they did,
                            would their order be obeyed by the local management in each case? If so,
                            what action would the Argentine Government, in particular, take? He was
                            fearful that the Argentine Government would then take over the company
                            and he wished to know what support this Government would then give to
                            RCA. Mr. Long indicated that this Government would do all it
                            appropriately could to protect RCA from the consequences of any action
                            it might take to close the circuits.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Long indicated confidentially that IT&amp;T was prepared to
                            discontinue immediately its telephone circuit between Buenos Aires and
                            Berlin. Colonel Sarnoff stated that, if IT&amp;T could do this, there
                            was no reason why the Consortium company could not also do it. He then
                            went on to say that, if we wished RCA to go ahead with this after we had
                            considered all the consequences, RCA would show no hesitation.</p>
                        <p>The question was raised of whether there were any physical means, such as
                            inadequate machinery, by which the circuits might be abandoned. Colonel
                            Sarnoff and Mr. Winterbottom indicated they did not believe there were
                            any such means, since the machinery required was for the most part
                            interchangeable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Winterbottom expressed the belief that if the Argentine company
                            closed the Axis circuits, the Argentine Government would the next day
                            open and operate them by itself, and he indicated that it had the
                            facilities with which to do this. It was pointed out that such action by
                            the Government would not interfere with the continued operation of its
                            other circuits by the company. The following course of action was then
                            agreed upon: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>RCA would immediately issue instructions to its
                                    representatives on the Board of Directors of the two companies
                                    to have the companies discontinue the Axis circuits immediately
                                    on their own initiative, the action to be taken by a Directors’
                                    meeting in each case. RCA would also instruct its
                                    representatives to insist on the appointment of Hayes.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>The Department would approach the British Foreign Office
                                    immediately with a request that it do what was necessary to have
                                    identical instructions issued forthwith to the respective
                                    Directors of the two companies who represent Cable and Wireless,
                                    Limited.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>It was agreed that this would be a more practical approach to the matter
                            than would be an attempt to achieve the same results through <pb n="144"
                                xml:id="pg_144" facs="0156"/>another meeting of the Consortium,
                            which would require 30 days notice to the trustees in any case.</p>
                        <postscript>
                            <p>Mr. Winterbottom complained at the fact that the Department, in its
                                own communications with its missions in South America, gave
                                preference to All America Cables over the RCA Radio Companies.
                                Colonel Sarnoff stated that the common view that cable traffic was
                                more secret than radio traffic was erroneous, and that in point of
                                fact the reverse was true. He also complained bitterly that IT&amp;T
                                had spread the report in Government circles that RCA was preventing
                                the establishment of additional circuits with Europe and the Near
                                East needed by the War Department by invoking a consent decree. He
                                said that he had been called to Mr. Thurman Arnold’s<note n="68"
                                    xml:id="d111fn68">An Assistant Attorney General.</note> office
                                in the Department of Justice and that Mr. Arnold was preparing to
                                have the consent decree abandoned on the basis of misinformation
                                that he had received from IT&amp;T.</p>

                        <p>1449. For Secretary and Under Secretary. Your telegram 1017, September 8,
                            7 p.m.<note n="69" xml:id="d112fn69">Not printed.</note> As stated in my
                            telegram 1421, September 3, 7 p.m., I saw President Ríos and submitted
                            proof which to my astonishment had not been called to his attention. I
                            again saw Barros Jarpa yesterday (Tuesday) on his return to city and
                            after reiterating all that had been said before and giving him
                            additional proof of the damage being done through the Axis
                            communications, I left with him a stiff note saying, among other things,
                            that these constitute as much a contribution against the defence of the
                            continent as though Chile sent war material. I then wrote personally to
                            President Ríos using as pretext an acknowledgment of an inscribed
                            photograph reminding him of our conversation of a few days ago and
                            enclosing a copy of the note to Barros Jarpa as of possible
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>Barros Jarpa always seems impressed and distressed when proof of these
                            Axis activities are submitted and this time he said he would go into the
                            matter with the President. He said just one significant thing, that
                            “until we break relations it looks like we must forbid the Axis Missions
                            the use of their code in communicating with their Governments”. Thus in
                            circular fashion he gets back to the proposition <pb n="145"
                                xml:id="pg_145" facs="0157"/>he had made me many weeks ago. I
                            suspect that in conformity with his strategy of yielding only inch by
                            inch this will be his proposal. I told him that Washington is gravely
                            concerned and asked him to let me know immediately when a decision has

                            him he had proposed cutting off use of codes to Axis Embassies and that
                            I had not favored it and he said it is true. I expressed astonishment
                            and told him the opposite was true. He did not appear surprised (see my

                        <p>1031. At a meeting on September 9 in the Department with representatives
                            of the Radio Corporation of America, the following decisions were taken: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>RCA will immediately instruct its representatives on the Board
                                    of Directors of Transradio Chilena to take action immediately at
                                    a meeting of the Board to have the company discontinue its
                                    circuits with the Axis on its own initiative.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>The Department is communicating immediately with the British
                                    Government with a view to having the representatives of Cable
                                    and Wireless on the Board of Directors receive identical
                                    instructions.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Similar action will be taken immediately with regard to the Axis circuits
                            maintained by the Consortium Company in Argentina.</p>
                        <p>While the action outlined above will not be taken in the name of this
                            Government or ostensibly on its initiative, you should inform the
                            President that it is contemplated and that you assume, in view of the
                            conversation with him reported in your 1421, September 3, 7 p.m., that
                            he will have no objection to it. If, however, it appears to you that
                            informing the President in this sense may prejudice a good prospect that
                            the Chilean Government will cut the circuits promptly of its own accord,
                            you should so inform the Department immediately and await further
                            instructions before approaching the President in the sense indicated
                            above.</p>

                        <p>4357. At a meeting on September 9 in the Department with representatives
                            of the Radio Corporation of America, it was decided that the following
                            action would be taken to bring about a closure of the circuits with the
                            Axis maintained by the Consortium companies in Argentina and Chile.</p>
                        <p>RCA will immediately instruct its representatives on the Boards of
                            Directors of the two companies to have the companies discontinue the
                            Axis circuits immediately on their own initiative, the action to be
                            taken by a Directors’ Meeting in each case. It will further instruct its
                            representatives in Argentina to insist on the appointment of George
                            Hayes as General Manager, in accordance with the decision of the
                            Consortium Trustees Meeting in New York last month.</p>
                        <p>The Department agreed to approach the British Foreign Office immediately
                            with a request that it do what is necessary to have identical
                            instructions issued forthwith to the respective Directors of the two
                            companies who represent Cable and Wireless Limited.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the American and British interests together command a
                            majority on each of the Boards of Directors. The success of the
                            procedure depends on joint action by the American and British interests.
                            Its purpose is to eliminate one flagrant means by which the Axis is
                            enabled to sink ships of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>The Department has reason to believe that, while it is possible that the
                            Argentine Government would undertake to operate these circuits itself if
                            the companies abandoned them, it is unlikely that either the Argentine
                            or Chilean Governments would take any more drastic action.</p>
                        <p>Please bring the foregoing to the confidential attention of the Foreign
                            Office, making the indicated request and emphasizing the urgency of the
                            matter, and report to the Department.</p>
                        <p>We are keeping the British Embassy here informed.</p>

                        <p>1469. For Secretary and Under Secretary. Your 1031, September 10, 7 p.m.
                            When Davis was here and I asked Barros Jarpa if Chile <pb n="147"
                                xml:id="pg_147" facs="0159"/>would raise objections if the RCA
                            itself cut off telecommunications with Axis countries, he immediately
                            replied in the negative, expressing a certain satisfaction. He then
                            qualified by saying he could conceive of nothing like opposition from
                            Chile, but if it came up he would have to study the question to see but
                            thought it would not be opposed here. This information I gave General
                            Davis the same day.</p>
                        <p>In my telegram 1421, September 3, 7 p.m., I reported statement of
                            President Ríos to effect he would shut down telecommunications with the
                            Axis if being used against the safety of American nations; and his
                            suggestion that the Transradio Chilena refuse messages for Axis
                            countries and see what would happen; the implication being that the Axis
                            Missions would protest and the Government do nothing about it.</p>
                        <p>My note asking the closing of telecommunication with Axis countries was
                            handed Barros Jarpa at 5 o’clock, September 8. He promised an early
                            reply. He was busy all day Thursday with Senate. Suggest that I inquire
                            tomorrow if answer is ready, and if not ready Monday that I inform him
                            that RCA will act and remind him that he had expressed some satisfaction
                            with this procedure. Assume British Government will issue similar
                            instructions to its representatives on board of directors but should we
                            not first know if such are being sent.</p>
                        <p>Since only 2 or 3 days should determine whether Chile will close
                            telecommunications on its own with the Axis countries, am persuaded
                            nothing as an alternative should be suggested before it has time to
                            act.</p>

                            effect of Brazilian request before informing Government here of decision
                            in your 1031 and plan to ask appointment for Monday.</p>

                        <p>4493. A representative of the British Embassy, came in this afternoon to
                            suggest, on instructions from his Government, that Wilshaw is anxious to
                            be of assistance in closing the circuits but thought that the trustees
                            of the Consortium ought to express some agreement with the action
                            indicated and suggested that Ginman, who represented the British members
                            of the Consortium at their recent meeting, should be consulted by
                            General Davis.</p>
                        <p>It was explained that that was at variance with the theory upon which we
                            were operating to close the beams of the two stations concerned. General
                            Davis was the Chairman of the Consortium which was composed of German
                            and French as well as British and American members. The business could
                            not be considered at a Consortium meeting except after 30 days notice.
                            It was not considered either necessary or advisable to bring the
                            Consortium into it. Consequently, it was inadvisable to have Davis
                            consult Ginman as both were operating in connection with the Consortium
                            group. As distinguished from that, the present movement is to have the
                            American member, which happens to be R. C. A., communicate directly with
                            its representatives on the Boards of Directors of the two local
                            companies and instruct them to take action looking to the immediate
                            closing of the two stations. It was hoped, and is still expected, that
                            the British member, Cables and Wireless, will take the same action in
                            regard to its own representatives on the Boards of each of these
                            companies. The British and American members control a majority on each
                            Board.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, it is hoped that Cables and Wireless will send instructions
                            direct to its own representatives in the sense of the instructions which
                            they have been advised are being sent to the American
                            representatives.</p>
                        <p>While it would be contrary to the theory of our operation to have Davis
                            confer with Ginman and the suggestion that Ginman should report to
                            London, it would be quite in keeping with the spirit if Cables and
                            Wireless should communicate directly with Ginman if they so desired, but
                            the effort is being made for definite political reasons to have the
                            initiative taken and the action consummated by act of the local
                            companies acting at the instigation of their respective superiors who
                            are the owners of the American and British interests.</p>
                        <p>The texts of the telegrams to be forwarded on behalf of R. C. A. are in
                            the Department but are being held until after a meeting of the Board of
                            Directors in B. A. scheduled for the 25th of September at <pb n="149"
                                xml:id="pg_149" facs="0161"/>which Hayes is expected to be elected
                            manager. As soon as that has transpired, the telegrams both to B. A. and
                            Santiago will be dispatched simultaneously. Of course, you will
                            appreciate the confidential nature of this information which you may in
                            your discretion communicate to the British. It was not divulged to the
                            representative of the British Embassy this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to continue your contacts with the Foreign Office in
                            this particular matter and bend your efforts to secure the influence of
                            the British Government upon Cables and Wireless to have instructions
                            sent along the lines indicated. If the action develops as we anticipate,
                            it may be necessary for the American and British Governments to act
                            simultaneously and along similar lines in supporting the action of the
                            British and American members of the local Boards of Directors. That
                            contingency is assumed to have been taken care of in the instructions
                            which we understand have been sent by the British Embassy to its
                            Ambassadors and which we have sent to our Ambassadors at those

                            respectively:</p>
                        <p>(1) “With reference to Your Excellency’s note of September 8, regarding
                            radiotelegraphic communications with the Axis countries, I telegraphed
                            the Embassies of Brazil in Santiago and Buenos Aires on this subject.
                            The latter informs me that the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs<note
                                n="76" xml:id="d119fn76">Guillermo Rothe.</note> said that Argentine
                            technicians are studying the matter. He suggested that when the study is
                            concluded, there should be an exchange of ideas among Brazilian,
                            Argentine, and Chilean technicians with a view of possibly taking
                            appropriate uniform measures.</p>
                        <p>It was further stated to Ambassador Rodriguez<note n="77"
                                xml:id="d119fn77">José de Paula Rodrigues Alves, Brazilian
                                Ambassador in Argentina.</note> that the Argentine Government had
                            requested the Government of the United States of America to furnish an
                            apparatus of American invention capable of identifying clandestine radio
                            telegraph stations but that thus far it had not received a reply which
                            leads it to suppose that the apparatus is secret.</p>
                        <p>(2) With reference to my letter of the 18th instant, the Brazilian
                            Embassy in Santiago advises me that the Chilean Government continues to
                            study with great interest the matter of prohibiting the use of codes by
                            the diplomatic representatives of the Axis countries. The Chilean
                            Government, however, calls attention to the recommendation of the
                            Inter-American Neutrality Committee of June 22, 1940, favorable to the
                            use of codes.<note n="78" xml:id="d119fn78">For correspondence

                        <p>On the other hand the Government of Chile believes that the application
                            of a prohibitive measure in the case of the Axis diplomatic missions
                            would remove a motive which might be involved in case it has to justify
                            the breaking off of relations at some future date”.</p>

                            Jory points out that Chilean directors may be hesitant to vote for
                            closure for fear the Government may take action against the company so
                            that some indication from the Government that it would not act against

                        <p>1599. In continuation my 1587, September 29, 4 p.m. Jory has discussed,
                            in strict confidence, closure of Axis circuits with Valenzuela, Chilean
                            director of Transradio Chilena, who has expressed himself as personally
                            in favor closing not only circuits to Axis territories but all European
                            circuits on grounds Transradio services must be reserved for American
                            countries. The crux of situation now appears to be votes [of] Valenzuela
                            and another Chilean director, Balmaceda, both representing C. E. I.
                            C.</p>
                        <p>Valenzuela inclines toward using pretext that vital supplies for
                            Transradio might be cut off if they continued to accept traffic for
                            enemy countries rather than Rio Resolutions on grounds that this would
                            be more easily accepted by Government. This line has been adopted by
                            this and British Embassies in all other questions of enemy commerce in
                            Chile and has not been seriously resisted by Chilean Government.
                            Alternatively Valenzuela suggests that he might take line that in order
                            to conserve existing apparatus and material it is essential to close the
                            circuits to the heavy traffic now existing with enemy countries.</p>
                        <p>Valenzuela believes that his co-director, Balmaceda, might hesitate to
                            vote for closure merely on grounds of compliance with Rio Resolutions
                            but probably would go along on basis of first mentioned procedure. In
                            this connection he observed that of a total of 7 votes 4 against 3 would
                            not be very satisfactory and that every effort should be made to get at
                            least 5 votes. This point has been discussed with British Embassy which
                            is telegraphing its Foreign Office suggesting that it be arranged with
                            C. E. I. C. to telegraph immediately to Valenzuela and Balmaceda
                            instructions in the sense that supplies for Transradio will be cut off
                            if they continue accept traffic for enemy countries.</p>
                        <p>Request that Department take the matter up urgently with C. E. I. C. in
                            the same sense. C. E. I. C.’s instructions must reach <pb n="153"

                                presume to dictate to the Argentine Government what it should do in
                                carrying out its international commitment. The nationalization of
                                utilities, perhaps a desirable end in itself, will have been given a
                                highly undesirable boost.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The correct procedure in my opinion is for the company to notify
                                the Argentine Government that as of a set date they will no longer
                                be able to give service to the Axis countries. They can allege a
                                variety of reasons including lack of material, faulty transmission,
                                failure of their German connections to observe proper operating
                                practices, et cetera, et cetera. The Government will then be placed
                                in a rather uncomfortable position with relation to the carrying out
                                of a commitment which it entered into at Rio.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>These circuits will not be cut off unless the Argentine Government wants
                            them cut off, or at least is willing to acquiesce in their being cut
                            off. The only possible alternative is some form of direct action which
                            would render the circuits unusable (interference, or jamming). I assume
                            that IN has explored this possibility from the technical angle.</p>

                        <p>I telephoned General Harbord on the evening of October 3 to read him a
                            paraphrase of the message addressed to him by Mr. Beccar Varela of
                            Transradio Internacional, which was contained in telegram <pb n="156"
                                xml:id="pg_156" facs="0168"/>no. 1908, October 2, 5 p.m.,<note
                                n="90" xml:id="d128fn90">Not printed.</note> from Buenos Aires. He
                            wrote the message down as I gave it to him, then inquired as to the
                            Department’s wishes with regard to the reply he should make. In
                            accordance with Mr. Long’s instructions, I told General Harbord that it
                            was the hope of the Department that he would find it advisable to
                            indicate to Mr. Beccar Varela the desirability of not informing the
                            Argentine officials in advance of the plans afoot for closing the Axis
                            circuits maintained by Transradio. General Harbord said that Beccar
                            Varela’s message more or less confirmed the view that R. C. A. had held
                            right along that the contemplated action would result in the taking over
                            of the company by the Argentine Government. He added that, however, it
                            had been felt R. C. A. had no choice but to go along in view of the
                            Department’s wishes. I assured him that the cooperative attitude of R.
                            C. A. in this matter was very much appreciated by the Department, and
                            added that while there was no absolute assurance of the reaction of the
                            Argentine Government, it was to be hoped that, if it did take counter
                            measures, these would be confined to ordering the immediate reopening of
                            the circuits. He replied that this, of course, depended upon the
                            political problem of how anxious the Argentine authorities might be to
                            take over full control of the company. I reminded him of the assurance
                            he had received, at a meeting in Mr. Long’s office, that the Department
                            would do everything that it appropriately could to back them up in case
                            they ran into serious difficulties as a result of the contemplated
                            action. He said he understood and appreciated this.</p>
                        <p>General Harbord said he would consult with General Davis and Mr.
                            Winterbottom and telephone me at 9:30 the following morning (October 4)
                            to give me his message in reply to the one from Beccar Varela.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Section Two:</hi></p>
                        <p>General Harbord telephoned this morning to say that it had been decided
                            to defer sending a reply to Beccar Varela pending the opportunity of
                            having another meeting with Mr. Long to discuss the matter. His opinion,
                            and that of his associates, he said, was that the situation had now
                            changed to one in which they were being asked to tell the Argentine
                            directors of Transradio not to let their own Government know what was
                            going on. He asked me to arrange for General Davis and Colonel Sarnoff
                            to call on Mr. Long at 3 o’clock tomorrow. I replied that I would
                            endeavor to make the arrangements. He said he would send General Davis
                            down to Washington tonight, on the chance that the meeting would be
                            arranged for tomorrow. He said that there would be no need for him to
                            attend the meeting, even though the reply to Beccar Varela would go in
                            his name.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Long expressed the view that the prospective election of Mr. George
                            Hayes as manager of Transradio Internacional in Buenos Aires should
                            precede any action by the Company to close its circuits with the Axis.
                            Everyone present agreed.</p>
                        <p>General Davis read a message he had received from Aguirre, President of
                            Transradio Internacional, in which he indicated that the meeting to
                            elect Hayes would take place this week and that he expected there would
                            be a majority in favor. Mr. Duggan raised the question of whether it was
                            necessary or would be possible to get Dr. Becu, now in Mexico, to send
                            his proxy to Buenos Aires in favor of Hayes. Mr. Winterbottom said that
                            the customary procedure was for the substitute director to attend
                            meetings in a director’s absence, upon the invitation of the President.
                            Since it was not certain how Becu’s substitute, Cardenas, might vote, it
                            was decided that the Department ask the Embassy in Buenos Aires
                            immediately to obtain Hayes’ estimate of whether Cardenas was going to
                            attend the meeting, how he would vote, and how the other directors would
                            line up.</p>
                        <p>It was decided that General Harbord should acknowledge the message from
                            Beccar Varela (contained in the Embassy’s 1908 of October 2, 5 p.m.<note
                                n="91" xml:id="d129fn91">Not printed.</note>), in which the latter
                            suggested consultation with the Argentine Government prior to action by
                            the Company to cut the circuits, with a message urging that Hayes’
                            election be expedited and stating that he would give his reaction to
                            Beccar Varela’s suggestion after it had taken place. General Davis said
                            he would send a reply to the message he had received from Aguirre, in
                            which he would again express the hope that everything would be done to
                            expedite the election of Hayes.</p>
                        <p>General Davis and Colonel Sarnoff advanced the view that it would not be
                            practical to ask Beccar Varela, an Argentine, to withhold from his
                            Government information which his loyalty to it might prompt him to make
                            available. Colonel Sarnoff felt that, should the Chilean Company take
                            action tomorrow to sever its Axis circuits, the directors of Transradio
                            Internacional could use this as a supplementary <pb n="158"
                                xml:id="pg_158" facs="0170"/>argument for the action they were
                            proposing to take. Mr. Duggan pointed out that should it be decided that
                            the Company would notify the Argentine Government in advance, it would
                            be advisable to defer such notification for as long as possible in order
                            to leave as little time as possible for counter-action. However, it was
                            agreed that no decision would be taken in this regard until after the
                            election of Hayes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Long stated that we had word from Chile to the effect that a valuable
                            pretext for breaking the Chilean circuits would be supplied if it could
                            be shown that otherwise necessary supplies of material for the Chilean
                            Company would be cut off. He read the draft of a telegram to our Embassy
                            in Santiago, containing a message to this effect from General Davis to
                            Mr. Jory, RCA representative on the Board of the Company. General Davis
                            agreed to having the message go.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Sarnoff referred to the “Cicero’s Oration” he had delivered in
                            Mr. Long’s office on September 9 with regard to the possibility that the
                            enemy was tapping our undersea cables. He said he had been called in to
                            see General Strong, the Chief of G2 about this matter, and that as a
                            consequence of the interview an experiment was being made to find out
                            just how difficult it might be to tap our cables. A Navy craft was being
                            sent out in the Atlantic to make the attempt, and Colonel Sarnoff
                            offered to inform Mr. Long of the results of this experiment.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Sarnoff suggested that a study be made of all cable messages on
                            ship movements that were transmitted during a recent period of some
                            three months with a view to determining whether any correlation is
                            evident between such messages and the actual sinking of ships. Mr. Long
                            accepted the suggestion and said the Department would act upon it. He
                            asked Mr. deWolf to see that this was done.</p>

                        <p>1633. 1. Saw Barros Jarpa this evening about closing telecommunications.
                            He said he had been discussing the matter with one of the men of the
                            company which had proposed what he, the Minister, had suggested to me
                            long ago, to refuse the use of the code to the missions of all countries
                            sending outside this hemisphere. He said the German Ambassador would
                            promptly protest and there would be a battle but that he would take the
                            position that this Government cannot insist on a company controlled
                            mostly by the people of the United Nations to put their property to the
                            use of the enemies of these nations and that the Government could not
                            interfere. He said then the Axis would probably plan to use the national
                            telegraph to get their code messages to Argentina for transmission but
                            that he could not conceive that Argentina would care to be put in the
                            position of carrying forward this work against continental defense.</p>
                        <p>He said the President cannot break relations just now on the eve of his
                            departure since he should be here in the event of any sabotage trouble
                            and that on his return all these problems would solve themselves thus
                            implying that on his return the President proposes to break relations.
                            He said he does not want the President to go away with the
                            telecommunication matter hanging fire because of the unpleasant feeling
                            that would result.</p>
                        <p>2. Valenzuela, Chilean director who proposed the compromise solution of
                            the Company’s refusing to accept for transmittal or delivery code
                            messages, claims this would be a better solution than merely closing
                            circuits with Axis territories, which would allow Axis Embassies to
                            transmit over other circuits which could be listened into from their
                            capitals. Jory asks that RCA instruct him how to note [<hi rend="italic"
                                >vote</hi>] on this proposition.</p>
                        <p>3. Since writing the foregoing Valenzuela says he has just received a
                            personal request from President Ríos asking him to postpone the
                            scheduled directors’ meeting from tomorrow until October 8.</p>

                        <p>1652. For Welles and Duggan. Heath’s telephone conversation and my 1633,
                            of October 5, 7 p.m. In tomorrow morning’s directors’ meeting Transradio
                            Chilena will probably decide to refuse to transmit or receive for
                            delivery any messages in secret code destined for or originating in any
                            non-American country. It would continue, however, to accept clear and
                            registered commercial code messages on non-American circuits. This will
                            not prevent Axis Embassies here from transmitting in their codes to Axis
                            Embassies in Buenos Aires for retransmittal to Axis capitals or perhaps
                            arranging for Axis radio authorities to listen in on the Santiago-Buenos
                            Aires radio circuits. This decision would, however, prevent the Swiss,
                            Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, and British diplomatic representatives
                            from being able to communicate over Transradio in confidential code
                            directly with their capitals but missions of these countries can still
                            continue communicate directly or indirectly in code over All America and
                            West Coast cables via routes crossing Allied censorship lines.</p>
                        <p>This is as far as the two Chilean directors who, after having been in
                            touch with Barros Jarpa and President Ríos, will go at this meeting. <pb
                                n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0173"/>Jory confirmed this and asks to
                            communicate to Radio Corporation of America his conviction that it will
                            be impossible at this time to secure a vote to completely close the Axis
                            circuits.</p>
                        <p>The directors assert, however, their proposal will accomplish more than
                            merely closing Axis circuits. They also say that this is to be regarded
                            as a first step toward the possible closure of circuits to the
                            transmission of all messages to non-American countries.</p>
                        <p>The British Commercial Counselor who has handled the matter for his
                            Embassy at first feared that his Government might object to a
                            prohibition on code messages to Britain but after talking with the
                            directors said he was convinced that no obstacles should be placed in
                            the way of the proposed action at this moment, and would advise London.
                            He observed that an exception could later be made in Britain’s favor if
                            desired. If insisted on now the Spanish and other European missions
                            would claim equal treatment and thus provide further loopholes for Axis
                            communications.</p>

                        <p>1. Trans Board of Directors without record vote approved following
                            motion: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I desire submit for the approval of directors a measure to bring
                                    to an end the rumor which has circulated for some time that our
                                    company is serving for the transmission of messages relating to
                                    war operations. Since several days these charges have been
                                    published in press articles which without specifically referring
                                    to us have placed us in a disagreeable situation. In conformity
                                    with instruction received from the shareholders I propose that
                                    beginning today the company not accept communications in secret
                                    cipher or code directed to or received from any non-American
                                    country”.</p></quote></p>
                        <p>Department’s 1189, October 7, 8 p.m.</p>
                        <p>2. Prior to the meeting directors Ricci, Jory, Blood [?] and the
                            President of the company, Valenzuela, orally informed the Embassy that
                            this decision of the Board was to be regarded as a “first step” directed
                            toward the entire possible closure of the Axis communications. They also
                            expressed the sincere belief that it would be a mistake to postpone the
                            meeting and the decision until the problematical date when the Chilean
                            Government would be willing to indicate to the two Chilean members of
                            the Board it desired them to vote for outright discontinuance of Axis
                            circuits. Without such indication the two Chilean directors, <pb n="162"
                                xml:id="pg_162" facs="0174"/>while friendly disposed, feel they
                            could not vote since it would be taking political action beyond that
                            approved by the Chilean Government itself and would also endanger the
                            concession of the company.</p>
                        <p>3. The following new complication has, however, arisen: despite the
                            tentative approval of his Commercial Attaché, the British
                                Ambassador<note n="94" xml:id="d134fn94">Charles W. Orde.</note>
                            today endeavored to get the Board to postpone applying the decision
                            until he received instructions that London had no objections. He was
                            told the decision could not be modified until another meeting was
                            called. I trust that the British Government will not object at this time
                            since it would give useful grounds for the Axis Embassies and the
                            Spanish and other European neutral missions to make similar protests,
                            devitalize the whole decision of the Board and provide additional
                            loopholes for German communications.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion the British Embassy needs to take no notice of a purely
                            company decision at this moment. The British Embassy is not sending code
                            messages over Transradio and has no intention of doing so since it is
                            not a means of confidential communication. At some later date or if and
                            when it becomes necessary for the British Embassy to send a cipher
                            telegram over Transradio then, if it should be refused, the matter would
                            become a practical issue and could be settled at once.</p>
                        <p>What the British Government might do if it feels it necessary to oppose
                            any prohibition of its code communications over Transradio is to take it
                            up later leisurely with CRIC asking it to instruct the directors here to
                            accept the suggestion of the British that exceptions be made to the
                            board’s decision as regards code communications to Britain. However, the
                            British Ambassador should be instructed immediately not to use his
                            influence to set aside or postpone the actual application of the board’s
                            decision since in so doing he would be following the lead of the German
                            director, the only one actively to oppose the decision. British Embassy
                            intervention at this time would make a diplomatic issue of a commercial
                            company decision and place the Chilean Government in a position which it
                            could with difficulty refuse sympathetically to entertain protests from
                            the other European countries with which confidential communication has
                            been cut off by the decision of Transradios’ board.</p>
                        <p>I have no doubt that if we continue our representations to the Chilean
                            Government particularly in view of the recent German spy exposures that
                            we can within a not too distant date proceed to direct closure of the
                            Axis radio circuits restoring at a later time, if the Department thinks
                            best, the privilege of code communication over Transradio circuits to
                            England alone.</p>

                            Post and Telegraph asked the manager of Transradio to suspend
                            enforcement of the directors decision not to accept code messages from
                            or to non-American territory. This afternoon the director of Post and
                            Telegraph gave tacit approval to Transradio directors decision and at
                            3:45 refused to accept a code message for Berlin from the German
                            Embassy. The German Ambassador protested to the Foreign Office but, we
                            are told, without effect.</p>

                        <p>Sir Ronald Campbell came in this afternoon at his request. We discussed
                            the situation in B. A. and Santiago and further steps to be taken in B.
                            A. I told him that we were proposing to take the next logical step which
                            was either to go through with the movement to sever the beams to the
                            Axis or to repeat in B. A. the step which Santiago had taken and stop
                            all communications by cipher or code to powers outside of the American
                            hemisphere. That would be decided late this afternoon or tomorrow, and I
                            would keep him advised.</p>
                        <p>Sir Ronald said that the British Embassy would probably take the same
                            attitude about its denial of cipher privileges from B. A. that it took
                            in Santiago. He had received from his Government information that
                            instructions had been sent to the British Ambassador in Santiago that he
                            do not protest the denial of cipher privileges there for the reason that
                            they did not use the radio. The same situation existing in B. A., he
                            thought his Government would take the same position but he could not
                            speak for his Government without consulting them.</p>
                        <p>I called Sir Ronald’s attention to the fact that we had heard
                            unofficially that the British Western Telegraph Company which operates
                            cable lines up and down the west coast of South America, and which had
                            either land lines or radio from Santiago to B. A., were transmitting
                            messages, intended for the Axis, to B. A. which messages would be
                            forwarded from B. A. direct to the Axis capitals. I told him that we had
                            not been officially advised of that fact but in case we should be
                            officially advised I would be glad to bring it to his attention in the
                            thought that his Government might care to take the same attitude to
                            those communications as it had to the Consortium station. He said he
                            thought his Government would do so if it was brought to their attention
                            and if it was a fact, and that he assumed that the proper step would be
                            to communicate with the Board of Directors there as had been done in the
                            case of the Consortium.</p>

                        <p>1592. The Department has received the following message from Harbord of
                            RCA to Hayes of Transradio: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Transradio Chilena has suspended the use of code and cipher
                                    telegrams to and from all countries outside the American

                                    security and incidentally benefited the company. Strongly
                                    recommend you take similar action notifying Bern accordingly.

                                    Government interventor. Give copy of this message to President
                                    Aguirre as alternative action to my previous suggestion
                                    regarding closing of Axis circuits.” (The country referred to
                                    is, of course, Chile.)</p></quote></p>
                        <p>The Department feels that the action proposed in the above message would
                            be more effective than action to close the Axis circuits only, since it
                            would prevent the Axis missions in Chile and Argentina from
                            communicating with their Governments in confidential code by way of
                            neutral countries. Such action by Transradio would not have any
                            practical effect on communications between your British colleague and
                            London, since the British Government does not use the facilities of
                            Transradio for confidential messages in any case. However, the question
                            has been raised as to whether the Argentine Government, in response to
                            the contemplated action of Transradio, might forbid the use of
                            confidential code on all telecommunication circuits extending out of the
                            hemisphere, in which case the British would be denied the use of the
                            cable operated by the Western Telegraph Company from Buenos Aires to
                            Ascension and thence indirectly to London for messages in confidential
                            code. In view of this possibility, the Department is requesting the
                            concurrence of the British Government in <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167"
                                facs="0179"/>the proposed action of Transradio, and you should await
                            word that this concurrence has been received before delivering General
                            Harbord’s message.</p>

                        <p>2081. Department’s 1592, October 23, 4 p.m. The Embassy agrees that
                            refusal of coded and cipher telegrams to and from all countries outside
                            of American continent is more effective than closing Axis circuits,
                            provided there is proper surveillance by Argentine authorities over
                            messages sent <hi rend="italic">en clair</hi>.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Transradio, it is not believed that local board will
                            undertake such action on own initiative. German, Italian and French
                            directors certainly will oppose. The three Argentine directors Aguirre,
                            Becu and Huergo would hesitate to approve not because they necessarily
                            oppose such action but because they are extremely reluctant to move
                            without prior approval of Argentine Government. Despite remote foreign
                            control Transradio has been regarded here as essentially Argentine, and
                            the recent election of American manager was not received
                            enthusiastically by some government officials. Consequently Transradio
                            feels that it is particularly vulnerable.</p>
                        <p>Also it is extremely doubtful whether Transradio directors would vote
                            such action without being assured that competitive companies will act
                            concurrently. While Transradio now obtains large bulk of traffic with
                            Continental Europe and Japan, code messages at least with Europe would
                            be diverted to other companies unless they acted likewise.</p>

                            in each communications company in endeavor to prevent messages to Axis
                            countries regarding shipping movements. We do not see how this would be
                            effective unless code and cipher facilities are refused to local Axis
                            Embassies, but it is not yet known if Argentina will go this far.</p>

                                printed; this communication called attention to reports that the
                                West Coast Cables Company was transmitting messages to Axis
                                countries (810.74/534).</note> West Coast Cables claims no such
                            messages have been accepted. Company is cooperating but as manager in
                            Chile apparently is without instruction from his home office British
                            Commercial Counselor has telegraphed London that all West Coast Cable
                            offices in this country be specifically instructed to follow in every
                            respect the same policy as All-America Cables. I believe it would be
                            desirable to also take up this matter with British officials in
                            Washington to assure prompt action.</p>
                        <p>As there now is reason to believe Chilean authorities would interpose no
                            objection to British and American companies even refusing plain language
                            messages from Axis Government representatives in Chile to similar
                            representatives in this country, and if offered to their representatives
                            in Argentina, I am suggesting to All-America Cables and the British
                            Embassy to the West Coast Cables that they refuse such messages.</p>
                        <p>I understand Axis Embassies are sending practically all their messages
                            encoded by Transradio to Buenos Aires from where they presumably are
                            being retransmitted to their Governments. I shall endeavor to persuade
                            Transradio to refrain from accepting this traffic. To date Chilean
                            Government has not denied Axis Government representative use of state
                            lines in Chile or to Buenos Aires. However, Ríos told Gajardo<note n="3"

                        <p>2088. Department’s 1592, October 23, 4 p.m.; and Embassy’s 2081, October
                            24, noon. proceeding on the assumption that Transradio by itself will
                            not follow the action of its Chilean affiliate, it is likely that such a
                            plan could be made effective only by action of Argentine Government, in
                            which case it is probable that the British also would be affected.
                            British Embassy here says its experts feel <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169"
                                facs="0181"/>that inability to use code or cipher would cause great
                            inconvenience, although it would abide by whatever decision is reached
                            in Washington and London.</p>
                        <p>Another plan has been suggested to me by Gache, Under Secretary for
                            Foreign Affairs, which would prohibit international messages by
                            radiotelegraph thus limiting them to cable. While prohibition of code or
                            cipher was not mentioned, his plan has considerable merit in that it
                            would force the Axis to send their messages by the cable facilities of
                            either All America Cables or Western Telegraph, thus enabling messages
                            to be held up and scrutinized in the United States or England.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that Gache would propose such a plan without knowledge
                            of the Cabinet, which may wish to answer the Under Secretary’s Boston

                            considerable difficulty in achieving the plan due to opposition which
                            would come from the radio communications companies such as Transradio
                            and Radiar, which would stand to lose most if not all of their traffic
                            depending on the scope of the proposal.</p>
                        <p>Gache asked my opinion of the plan and I told him I thought it offered
                            distinct possibilities. He also mentioned it to the British who also
                            feel that it deserves full consideration and are so advising their
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>If the Department thinks well of the idea, which has the advantage of
                            coming from the Argentine Government itself, then even if the British
                            Government concurs in the former plan of restricting coded and cipher
                            messages to the American Hemisphere, it may be advisable to hold up
                            delivery of the Harbord message to Hayes pending further developments on
                            the Gache plan.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s comments would be appreciated.</p>

                        <p>1622. Your 2081, October 24, noon, and 2088, October 26, 6 p.m. It
                            appears that Gache’s suggestion goes beyond what is necessary in order
                            to prevent the Axis from using Argentine communications to the detriment
                            of the American republics, in that it would close down international
                            radio telegraph circuits within the hemisphere. The Department feels
                            that the objective would be achieved by prohibiting <pb n="170"
                                xml:id="pg_170" facs="0182"/>the transmission or acceptance of
                            messages merely on those radio telegraph and radio telephone circuits
                            that extend directly out of the hemisphere. It is, furthermore,
                            persuaded that this would be acceptable both to Transradio and Radiar.
                            You will recall that at the meeting of the Consortium Trust in New York
                            last August the trustees recommended that each national company should
                            promptly comply with the wishes of its government relating to the
                            closing of any circuit. The attitude of IT&amp;T has been consistently
                            cooperative.</p>
                        <p>You may wish to suggest to Gache the possibility of putting his plan into
                            effect in the modified form indicated above. This would contribute
                            effectively to isolating the Axis agents in Argentina and Chile from
                            their bases.</p>
                        <p>Having regard for the likelihood that a satisfactory plan along the lines
                            of Gache’s proposal may be put into effect in the near future, you
                            should use your discretion as to whether or when to deliver Harbord’s
                            message keeping the Department currently informed.</p>

                        <p>1302. Your 1808, October 24, noon. Please seek an early interview with
                            President Ríos for the purpose of bringing the following to his
                            attention:</p>
                        <p>Since the Axis missions in Santiago have been denied the use of secret
                            code or cipher on circuits extending directly out of the hemisphere,
                            they have continued to communicate in secret code or cipher with their
                            Governments by way of the Axis missions in Buenos Aires, resorting to
                            the commercial circuits that connect the two capitals. They are,
                            consequently, still free to transmit to their Governments by secret
                            rapid communication, as they have in the past, information that may lead
                            to the loss of ships and lives of the American republics. This
                            Government is most anxious that means may be found for bringing under
                            control this last channel of secret rapid communication by Axis agents
                            in Chile with their Governments, and it feels that it can count on the
                            sympathy and friendly cooperation of the Chilean Government in achieving
                            this objective.</p>
                        <p>Having made the foregoing clear to President Ríos, you should ask for any
                            suggestions that he may have for remedying this situation, saying that
                            you feel free to make this request in view of the cordial relations that
                            exist between our two Governments and previous assurances that the
                            Chilean Government will do whatever is necessary to prevent Axis agents
                            in Chilean territory from taking any action <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171"
                                facs="0183"/>detrimental to the American republics. You should point
                            out to the President that, even if the private companies were to refuse
                            all messages in secret code or cipher over the lines to Buenos Aires,
                            the Axis missions would still be free to communicate secretly over the
                            national telegraph system to Argentina.</p>
                        <p>You should indicate clearly that, in our view, the telecommunication
                            situation will not have been completely remedied while it is still
                            possible for Axis agents in Chile to make any use of Chile’s external
                            telecommunication facilities, whether for plain messages or code. You
                            may say, however, that a complete denial of secret code facilities to
                            the Axis missions would be an important step in this direction.</p>
                        <p>Of course, if the Axis missions in Chile are denied the use of
                            telecommunication facilities, they will still be free to send
                            confidential communications to Buenos Aires by overland or air mail.
                            However, the delay involved would have an important effect in limiting
                            the means by which Axis agents in Chile can do damage to us and to the
                            other American republics.</p>
                        <p>You should, of course, be alert to guard against any action by the
                            Chilean Government that would impair our communications or those of your
                            British colleague.</p>

                        <p>5407. If we eventually succeed in closing radio circuits to Axis
                            countries operated by the consortium radio stations in Buenos Aires and
                            Santiago, it is of course imperative that the traffic carried by such
                            circuits should not be diverted to cables. It is therefore desired to
                            know as soon as possible whether all cable traffic between Buenos Aires
                            and continental European points (which is believed to be handled by the
                            Western Telegraph Company, a British concern) is diverted via London and
                            does not go directly to Portugal. It is also desired to know whether the
                            British authorities are prepared to stop and not reforward any messages
                            intended for Axis countries including all diplomatic messages except
                            those of the Argentine Government, whether in code or not. Please
                            endeavor to obtain as much information as possible concerning the cable
                            situation between Argentina and Europe and assure British authorities
                            that it will be kept in strictest confidence.</p>

                            messages in code were prohibited and attempts were then made by the Axis
                            to send telegrams in code by cable the British authorities would be able
                            to control these telegrams. Foreign Office points out in this connection
                            that British cable communications between Buenos Aires and the Axis go
                            by way of Portugal and London and that telegrams of the Axis could be
                            stopped in London.</p>
                        <p>With reference to telegrams from one neutral to another neutral Foreign
                            Office says that it assumes that we would not wish the British
                            authorities to attempt to stop them. British authorities of course
                            would, Foreign Office adds, exercise control over telegrams to the Axis
                                <hi rend="italic">en clair</hi>. Foreign Office also assumes we
                            would be able to stop any Axis messages if the attempt were made to send
                            them over cables on the West Coast.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Office sums up British view as follows: British authorities would
                            be glad to see all code messages by radio prohibited or, in case this is
                            not found to be feasible, they would be glad to see all radio code
                            messages sent to or received from non-American countries, as in the case
                            of Chile, prohibited.</p>
                        <p>Under no circumstances the Foreign Office emphasizes would the British
                            authorities agree to the prohibition of their cable code message. If
                            this were attempted by the Argentinians the British authorities,
                            according to the Foreign Office would throughout the British Empire take
                            retaliatory measures against Argentina.</p>
                        <p>No part of the foregoing has been repeated to Buenos Aires.</p>

                        <p>1996. All America Cables Company today refused traffic from the Vichy
                            Legation here to Vichy and immediately cabled West Coast Cables asking
                            them to verify that they would also refuse. The manager and later the
                            Commercial Counselor of the British Embassy confirmed that West Coast
                            could not refuse to accept the message since they are still without
                            instructions from London. Can’t London be moved to stop all traffic to
                            Axis-controlled territory or is this British loop-hole of espionage
                            transmission to continue to be made available? Reference is my 1981,

                            5738, November 16 regarding the Argentine decree concerning
                            telecommunications. The British authorities, Foreign Office emphasizes,
                            have every intention of controlling Axis cipher messages transmitted by
                            cable, and they are now investigating the best means of putting the
                            control into operation. Foreign Office has promised to inform Embassy as

                        <p>2362. I called by appointment on the President this afternoon. It was the
                            first opportunity I had had to speak to him other than on formal
                            occasions. He received me with his customary cordiality and as usual
                            seemed to be in agreement on various points raised. Regarding the war he
                            made the categorical statement that he feels Germans are already beaten.
                            He congratulated me on our success Pacific and also on North African
                            expedition which he fully realized had resulted not only in effective
                            defense of American continent against attack, but had as one of its
                            prime motives freeing France from Nazi domination. In response to my
                            suggestion he said he would take favorable opportunity to make clear
                            this was his feeling. In the meantime he felt Foreign Minister’s message
                            to Secretary of State had made Government’s position clear.</p>
                        <p>He told me the Government was proceeding vigorously to complete
                            investigation of Axis activities brought to their notice in our
                            memoranda and assured me results would be fully published just as soon
                            as opportunity had been afforded to complete examination of voluminous
                            documents seized, most of them in German. In the meantime he agreed with
                            my suggestion that his Government should proceed promptly to issue
                            communications decree prohibiting use of cipher messages by radio
                            outside of continent.</p>
                        <p>While previous experience has warned me against accepting such assurances
                            too literally it seems possible that war news has had salutary effect
                            even in these high quarters as it undoubtedly has on certain others
                            hitherto in opposite camp and that we may expect more cooperation on
                            matters mentioned. However, I shall remain skeptical until words have
                            been transformed into action.</p>

                        <p>2384. Embassy’s telegram No. 2362, November 24, 9 p.m. I have been
                            working closely with British Embassy to persuade Government to put
                            through the original decree on telecommunications which would prohibit
                            transmission of cipher messages by radio outside of the continent
                            including messages by diplomatic missions. The real value of <pb n="175"
                                xml:id="pg_175" facs="0187"/>the decree would, in fact, be that it
                            would prevent transmission of such messages by Axis missions here.</p>
                        <p>I am now informed that in conversation yesterday with Under Secretary of
                            Foreign Affairs the Counselor or [<hi rend="italic">of</hi>] the British
                            Embassy was informed that as now framed decree would not deny to
                            Embassies the use of radio for cipher messages. It seems quite evident
                            that this change has been due to pressure from Axis missions. Gache
                            indicated that final decision was in hands of the President alone and
                            agreed to facilitate interview for British Ambassador with him in last
                            minute effort to obtain publication of decree as originally drafted.</p>

                        <p>2389. In a very outspoken talk with Gache this evening I told him that I
                            was amazed to learn, in spite of the assurance given me by the Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs and by the Minister of the Interior to the effect
                            that the use of cipher and code will be prohibited for radio messages
                            outside of the continent, that the Government was now considering
                            permitting these. Gache very much on the defensive said that the plan
                            was that such messages would be restricted as to number of words
                            permitted but that the Minister felt to forbid them completely would run
                            counter to the international policy hitherto followed by the Government.
                            To this justification point of view I replied by asking what
                            interpretation my Government could be expected to place upon their
                            having agreed to forbid cipher messages prior to having full knowledge
                            of the extent of Axis espionage activities and now having through Napp’s
                                confession<note n="10" xml:id="d154fn10">See telegram No. 2339,

                            known it before, of the full complicity of the German Embassy, decided
                            to permit them. The Minister had, I said, himself shown me the figures
                            of numbers of cipher groups sent by the three Axis Embassies and told me
                            that on the basis of these alone the decree as originally drafted was
                            necessary. The Minister of the Interior had volunteered to me that with
                            the extensive use made of the code by Axis Missions there was no need
                            for them operating clandestine stations. I asked to see Guiñazú but was
                            told he would prefer to discuss the decree with me after it has been
                            signed and he had it in <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0188"
                            />definite form. On my insistence that the main reason for seeing him
                            was to make my Government’s position clearly known to him before the
                            decree was issued in final form he promised to try to arrange a meeting
                            for tomorrow.</p>

                            the results were most discouraging. He confirmed in detail what Gache
                            told me yesterday. He tried to defend the Government’s position on the
                            ground that under international law the rights [to] use the cipher was a
                            privilege of which Axis Missions could not be completely deprived
                            without risking a break in diplomatic relations. To my question whether
                            he did not feel that Axis representatives had forfeited any rights that
                            they might have even under international law by their actions now
                            clearly disclosed he insisted that these have not yet been proved but
                            that if it should later develop that German or any other Axis Embassies
                            were actually implicated in subversive or espionage activities
                            Government would then be prepared to take further action. In the
                            meantime they proposed to limit the three Embassies to a maximum of
                            probably not more than 100 code groups each per day. I told him that in
                            my opinion this was entirely unsatisfactory and that the only solution
                            that could accomplish purpose desired would be to forbid the use of
                            [cable?] and radio outside of the continent to all Embassies for all
                            cipher messages. He gave no indication, however, that the Government
                            would be disposed to withdraw from its position unless some unexpected
                            development arises. Therefore, I am afraid Government is determined to
                            issue decree with above modifications.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of the Interior and another official with whom I have spoken
                            made the confidential suggestion that our Government might consider
                            having Transradio close some circuit to Axis countries. I intimated this
                            had always been considered but that we would naturally have preferred to
                            see such action taken by Argentine Government itself. In this connection
                            I understand that proposed decree contains clause which would forbid
                            private companies from closing any of Italian circuits without
                            Government approval. If this is true it may present a serious difficulty
                            for the companies particularly Transradio to take such action even if a
                            majority of the directors be disposed to approve it.</p>

                        <p>The British Ambassador saw the President this evening in last attempt to
                            persuade him to adhere to the original terms [of] the decree. He left
                            with the impression that something would be done but what, exactly, he
                            did not gather.</p>

                        <p>1859. Your 2389, November 26, 8 p.m. I am glad that you clearly indicated
                            to Gache your amazement at the Argentine Government’s apparent yielding
                            to the Axis. If you have not already done so, you might point out in
                            your future interviews that even if the Argentine Government should
                            prohibit the transmission of messages in code and cipher by radio it
                            falls short of the terms of Resolution 40 of the Rio Conference which
                            was signed by Argentina and provides for the closing of all
                            radiotelephone and radiotelegraph communications between the American
                            republics and the aggressor nations. You might also point out that
                            denying the right to Axis missions to transmit messages in code may be
                            an inconvenience to them but that failure to prohibit the transmission
                            of such code messages results in the loss of life and property belonging
                            to the United Nations, a most one-sided interpretation of
                            neutrality.</p>
                        <p>In the last war, during the period of our neutrality, the only means of
                            communication between this country and Germany was by radio. We
                            controlled the radio stations and refused to send any messages in code
                            for the diplomatic missions of the Central Powers unless a copy of such
                            code was furnished to the Navy personnel in charge of the radio
                            stations. You might bring this information to the attention of the
                            Argentine officials. The pertinent provisions of the Regulations
                            relative to the operation of the Tuckerton radio station, which
                            provisions were brought to the attention of the diplomatic
                            representatives of foreign governments in Washington, are as follows:

                            with the matter. The latter said memorandum was very interesting and
                            promised full study. As to decree itself he made following informal
                            comments.</p>
                        <p>While recognizing that we were not satisfied with the scope of decree as
                            finally issued, he claimed that, nevertheless, it would accomplish a
                            great deal. Previously some of the local Axis Missions had been sending
                            as high as 1500 to 2,000 code words daily, and reduction to a 100 would
                            seriously curtail their activities. Also he said perhaps we were placing
                            too much emphasis on Embassy messages, since formerly any private
                            citizen could transmit subversive messages freely and henceforth this
                            would be strictly controlled. He said there was a definite possibility
                            of imposing further restrictions on Axis communications, and intimated
                            we could make much stronger demands along these lines if we were able to
                            show concrete evidence of subversive information being transmitted by
                            Axis Embassies here.</p>

                        <p>Article 1 of Resolution XL adopted at the Third Meeting of Ministers of
                            Foreign Affairs of the American Republics at Rio de Janeiro refers to
                            the closing of “all radiotelephone and radiotelegraph communications
                            between the American Republics and the aggressor States <pb n="180"
                                xml:id="pg_180" facs="0192"/>and all territories subservient to
                            them, except in so far as official communications of the American
                            Governments are concerned.”</p>
                        <p>The Argentine Government would have gone a long way in complying with
                            Resolution XL by prohibiting the exchange of all coded messages between
                            Argentina and the aggressor states and their satellites. In fact, it was
                            the understanding of this Embassy that such a prohibition was planned by
                            the Argentine Government when the December 2 decree was being
                            drafted.</p>
                        <p>However, the effectiveness of such a prohibition will be largely vitiated
                            if all diplomatic missions are to have the privilege of sending 100
                            coded words daily, bearing in mind that this privilege apparently is
                            accorded not only to the diplomatic representations of the Tripartite
                            Pact but also to the representations of other countries temporarily
                            under the domination of the Axis powers.</p>
                        <p>When it is considered that all of the other American Republics have
                            prohibited the transmission of coded messages to these aggressor states,
                            and that virtually all of the American Republics have severed such
                            telecommunications altogether, the 100-word privilege for code and the
                            apparent lack of restriction on plain language messages still leaves
                            ample opportunity for the transmission of communications which “impair
                            or endanger, directly or indirectly, the security of the American
                            nations, or which may be contrary to the defense thereof”,
                            notwithstanding Article 5 paragraph 3 of the Argentine Government’s
                            December 2 decree.</p>
                        <p>This Embassy is in complete agreement with the desirability of
                            establishing efficient control over the transmission of private
                            international messages, by whatever system of telecommunication, but
                            wishes to point out that it remains possible for Axis banking
                            institutions, mercantile establishments, and even private individuals to
                            transmit subversive information by disguising it in the form of
                            innocuous messages.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum of December 4 from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and
                            Worship envisages the “total suppression of secret language if in the
                            use of such privilege there is evidence of abuses or transgressions
                            affecting the security”, but adds that the Argentine Government has no
                            proof of such transgressions. In the meantime, however, the charges made
                            by the judicial authorities of the Argentine Government against Axis
                            agents, in which at least one member of the German diplomatic mission
                            appears to be definitely implicated, would seem to indicate that there
                            are additional and sufficient reasons for further implementing Argentine
                            telecommunications control in still closer adherence to Resolution XL
                            adopted at Rio de Janeiro.</p>

                            4 p.m., the British Foreign Office is agreeable to the prohibition of
                            code messages to or from non-American countries by radio, although it
                            would under no circumstances agree to the prohibition of code messages

                            that it would be inadvisable, transmit Harbord’s message to Hayes with a

                        <p>You may tell Hayes, if you believe it desirable, that there is no

                            action. It would appear desirable, however, to allow the least possible
                            time to elapse between notification of the Argentine authorities and the

                        <p>2588. Department’s 1966, December 17, 7 p.m. After consulting with
                            British Chargé d’Affaires it was decided to read Harbord’s message to
                            Hayes and obtain latter’s opinion on desirability of transmitting it to
                            Aguirre. Hayes flatly stated that it would not have desired effect. He
                            said local directors would question Harbord’s authority to make such
                            request and that it would have to come from Hallauer<note n="17"
                                xml:id="d161fn17">Secretary of the Consortium.</note> addressed to
                            the company for Aguirre’s attention before it would receive proper
                            consideration. Even then he doubted if Board would take such action
                            without previous approval from Argentine Government as otherwise there
                            would be certainty of further official intervention. With regard to
                            Transradio Chilena action he pointed out that it was Chilean Government
                            which took initiative. His general remarks confirmed observations made
                            in Embassy’s 2081, October 24, noon, and he added that Aguirre might
                            resign rather than attempt to carry out such action on company’s
                            initiative.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned in Embassy’s despatch 7779, December 17,<note n="18"

                            made representations to the <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0194"
                            />Argentine Government on December 11 regarding the 700 code words
                            weekly by radio accorded to each diplomatic mission. Yesterday the
                            German, Italian and Japanese diplomatic representatives separately
                            visited Foreign Minister to complain that decree placed them at
                            disadvantage. Foreign Minister replied that although it was intention to
                            maintain existing regulation their claims would be brought to the
                            attention of the President.</p>
                        <p>It now appears that December 2 decree will be interpreted broadly to
                            allow transmission of coded radio messages by unofficial entities also
                            provided code is in common use and other provisions of decree complied
                            with.</p>
                        <p>Referring to Department’s airgram A–369, November 16,<note n="19"
                                xml:id="d161fn19">Not printed.</note> we would be in much stronger
                            position to press for total elimination of coded messages by radio if we
                            could show Argentine Government copies of any subversive messages sent
                            by local Axis missions.</p>

                            received from Ambassador Bowers: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Chilean Foreign Office, disturbed over the reported
                                    introduction of a motion calling for strong control of
                                    communications from and to those nations which as yet have not
                                    severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers, has
                                    instructed its Ambassador in Montevideo to ask that
                                    consideration of this motion be delayed. Since the breaking of
                                    relations by Chile is imminent, Ambassador Bowers feels that it
                                    would be well to forget the motion until some time after the
                                    first of the year, particularly since the Foreign Office has no
                                    objection to the motion once Chile has broken, but fears that
                                    the motion itself may be interpreted by opponents in Chile as
                                    undue pressure and an attack on the national dignity of Chile.
                                    Ambassador Bowers adds that he understands that this motion was
                                    introduced by the American delegate.”</p></quote></p>
                        <p>The Department concurs in the Ambassador’s opinion and therefore requests

                        <p>2017. Hallauer, as Secretary of the Consortium could presumably not
                            instruct Transradio in the sense indicated in your 2588, December 18, 2
                            p.m., without an explicit directive to that effect from the trustees
                            themselves. This would necessitate another trustees’ meeting, which
                            hardly seems practicable. However, Harbord has consented to having his
                            message addressed to Beccar Varela, who represents RCA, instead of to
                            Hayes. There appears to be no reason why Beccar Varela, acting on this
                            recommendation from the interests which he represents, could not ask for
                            a directors’ meeting for the purpose of considering the recommendation.
                            It is understood that the representative of the British interests would
                            cooperate. See your 1883, September 29, 7 p.m.<note n="21"

                        <p>The Department is agreeable to having the Argentine authorities notified
                            in advance that such a meeting was going to be held to consider such a
                            proposal. It recognizes that the Argentine authorities may forbid the
                            contemplated action, but feels that nothing would be lost thereby and
                            that something might be gained. The Argentine Government would be placed
                            in the position of taking a positive action in opposition to a measure
                            designed to strengthen hemisphere defense in the spirit of the Rio
                            Resolutions. Since the Board would presumably not take action contrary
                            to the expressed instructions of the Argentine Government, the company
                            would presumably not expose itself to punitive measures.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean Government did not take the initiative in the action of
                            Transradio Chilena. It refrained from opposing that action, and after it
                            had been taken, Chilean authorities indirectly indicated their approval
                            in public statements relating to the Under Secretary’s Boston
                            address.</p>
                        <p>The Department is not at present in a position to make a positive reply
                            to the suggestion contained in the last paragraph of your telegram under
                            reference.</p>
                        <p>Please deliver Harbord’s message to Beccar Varela, indicating if it seems
                            appropriate that the American company has reason to be embarrassed by
                            its participation in an enterprise that renders such service to the Axis
                            as enables it to destroy ships and personnel of the United Nations. If
                            you feel there are decided objections to such a course, you should defer
                            action, informing the Department and awaiting further instructions.</p>

                        <p>2669. Department’s 2017, December 26, 4 p.m. Harbord’s message delivered
                            to Beccar Varela who after discussing it with Roberts, British
                            representative on Local Board, has furnished Embassy memorandum along
                            following lines.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Today I spoke with Roberts who said that for some time he has held
                                opinion that no approach should be made by the Company and still
                                less by any of the directors. Such approach should be of an official
                                or diplomatic character exclusively. From another viewpoint it is
                                not believed that step suggested would produce any practical
                                result.</p>
                            <p>Roberts’ viewpoint is also mine, and I add that the nature of our
                                concession and the attitude of the authorities who have drastically
                                regulated everything pertaining to communications to the exterior
                                make it impossible for a company to adopt resolutions without first
                                submitting them officially to the Government.</p>
                            <p>Private consultation with the authorities by Roberts and myself
                                probably would not give any practical result. Anyway this should not
                                be done without intervention of Aguirre and, furthermore, to do it
                                without the previous assent of the Board itself would be improper.
                                Roberts believes that matter should not be discussed even with
                                Aguirre and consequently does not believe it should be submitted to
                                the Board, which probably would not approve it in any event.</p>
                            <p>As can be seen our personal desire to cooperate with ideas of Harbord
                                collides with Company’s position before the Government, the
                                presumable attitude of the latter, and the difficulties which would
                                arise among the directors.”</p></quote>
                        <p>Hayes insists that Transradio Chilena was first approached informally by
                            a Chilean official before its board agreed to take action.</p>
                        <p>It is apparent that Argentine directors will be much more stubborn, even
                            in unlikely event that Argentine Government gives informal assent to
                            proposed action.</p>
                        <p>Position assumed by local company as represented in above memorandum
                            would appear to present us with impasse so far as carrying out procedure
                            suggested by Department. I am entirely in agreement with Department that
                            if in some way Company could take action suggested this would place
                            Argentine Government in position of taking positive action in opposition
                            to measure carrying out spirit of Rio resolutions.</p>
                        <p>Only suggestion Embassy has to make would be to present question squarely
                            to Foreign Office along following lines: that it is incredible to expect
                            company half owned by American and British interests to continue to send
                            messages to Axis countries enabling them to sink <pb n="185"
                                xml:id="pg_185" facs="0197"/>our ships and conveying information of
                            value to enemy. In view of this, our Government proposes to instruct
                            American representative in Company (presumably British Government would
                            do likewise) to propose to Board that no messages in code be sent to
                            non-American countries, a measure originally envisaged in Argentine
                            Government’s own decree but later modified. If Foreign Minister as seems
                            probable, were to give negative answer this would at least have
                            accomplished purpose mentioned in Department’s telegram. However, if
                            such action could be timed to follow closely upon break in relations by
                            Chile, this might make Argentine Government more hesitant to take such a
                            position.</p>

                        <p>As you probably realize, there is only one kind of information which
                            could be called “absolutely reliable” in this situation. This is
                            information which comes from enemy sources. Unhappily, they have been
                            getting and sending information which, in many instances, has been
                            accurate. They insist that it comes out of the Embassy. The assertion by
                            itself would mean nothing; and the information by itself would not prove
                            anything. The combination of the two, however, <pb n="187"
                                xml:id="pg_187" facs="0199"/>does give cause for very grave concern.
                            The information is principally military in character.</p>
                        <p>I regret that I cannot give you excerpts of the various data. The
                            proprietors of the information seem to feel that they can’t do so lest

                            were Albrecht Gustav Engels (Alfredo of CEL group) and Herbert von Heyer
                            (Humberto of CEL group). Police is expected to round up the remaining
                            individuals in the radio rings within next 24 hours with our guidance.
                            It will be necessary to furnish police confidentially some little of the
                            evidence contained in intercepted messages if these men are to be held
                            in permanent custody. The Brazilian authorities themselves have no
                            evidence against them. I repeat that these individuals are the principal
                            agents who have been telegraphing the movement of planes, ships, et
                            cetera to Germany. If we can hold them we can probably cripple the whole

                        <p>966. Department’s 696, March 19. Under our guidance the police have so
                            far today arrested 26 of the 30 persons we have indicated to them as
                            connected with the four espionage rings operating Rio and sending
                            clandestine wireless messages. This should paralyze their
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>The police hope to have the other 6 [<hi rend="italic">4?</hi>] by
                            tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>All of the evidence necessary to hold them is contained in the
                            intercepted messages. I do not perceive how the authorities can be
                            furnished with this evidence without discreetly letting them know that
                            it comes from intercepted messages.</p>

                        <p>1000. My 992, March 22, 7 p.m. In connection with the arrests made during
                            the past 3 days, I respectfully submit the following thoughts to the
                            Department: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>It seems reasonable to assume that the Germans will strongly
                                    suspect that the 30 arrests were made on evidence intercepted in
                                    radiograms as specifically these 30 implicated in the messages
                                    were arrested and no others: We have no evidence to arrest
                                    others.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>With these arrests more than 70 per cent of the agents in
                                    South America connected with these radio rings are at least
                                    temporarily out of the way. This includes many carefully trained
                                    men whom it will take at least one or two years to
                                    replace.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The police have arrested these men at our request and are
                                    holding them on the definite promise that we would furnish
                                    evidence for their prosecution. By evidence I mean more than our
                                    statement that we have secret information.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>These arrests have dealt a paralyzing blow to the German
                                    communications system but if we cannot furnish the local police
                                    with real evidence, they must release them and they will without
                                    doubt reorganize somehow, somewhere, their communications which
                                    will result in further sinking of ships and may impede
                                    operations of our bomber ferry service.</item>

                            appreciates that it will be necessary to supply such evidence as in your
                            discretion will be essential to deal with the situation, but in view of
                            the importance of the source of information we are extremely anxious
                            that everything possible be done to prevent its being jeopardized or
                            destroyed. In view of the fact that it is at least uncertain on which
                            side the sympathies of the Rio de Janeiro Chief of Police lie, could you
                            go direct to President Vargas or Aranha<note n="9" xml:id="d175fn9"

                            the evidence which it may be necessary to supply? This might have the
                            double advantage of decreasing the danger of the spies being released
                            and also diminish the chances of publicity concerning the arrests and
                            the method of the accomplishment thereof.</p>

                            now in custody nearly 200 Axis suspects which number includes the four
                            espionage rings. The Rio police told me that the premature release of
                            these arrests to the press was brought about by their desire to beat the

                            Aires, because the Brazilian Government suspects that the company is

                        <p>Yesterday the São Paulo Political Police seized medium power radio
                            transmitter at Fazenda Tesouro, Buri, São Paulo, believed to have had
                            daily communication with Germany, and to have been integrating with the
                            existing German system of espionage communications. The proprietor of
                            the Fazenda Tesouro, Carl Heinz Bohne, has been arrested together with
                            Hans Rudolph August Bohn, Teodor Bohl and Francisco Winkler all of them

                        <p>Also arrested yesterday was Iundi Yoshikawa, Lieutenant Colonel of the

                        <p>Also apprehended as the result of a letter addressed to the Italian
                            Ambassador in Rio de Janeiro was Oswaldo Scognamillo who, it is
                            satisfactorily established is an Italian espionage agent in São Paulo.
                            He appears to have been acting also as a private agent of General Lucio
                            Esteves. Scognamillo’s companion, Fernando Martini is being sought for
                            arrest. Please inform immediately FBI.</p>

                        <p>1224. In view of the Department’s insistence on caution in connection
                            with the intercepted messages the Embassy has not given copies of these
                            messages to the local police: In other words although the local police
                            are still holding the spies they have no evidence against them other
                            than intimations and insinuations that we have given them; and they
                            would like to release them.</p>
                        <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0207"/>
                        <p>In the meantime a report has been brought to my attention by the British
                            Embassy from their agent at Recife containing the following statement:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have since received through my police contact copies of radio
                                    intercepts handed to the Army General Staff by the American
                                    Naval Observer, Recife. Intercept of January 18, from Worto,
                                    Germany, states (extract) ‘star (Fink) reports are held back on
                                    account of personal supervision’ which seems to be about this
                                    contention.”</p></quote></p>
                        <p>In view of this does the Department still desire me to continue to
                            withhold the messages from the police. As the Department is aware the
                            police are holding the 30 principal spies whom we asked them to arrest;
                            as the Department is also aware, since these men have been in jail
                            German spy communications with this country have been practically
                            interrupted.</p>

                            p.m., which meant that the Department agreed with the necessity of your
                            supplying such evidence as you feel it essential to give the Police to
                            insure the detention and successful prosecution of the espionage radio
                            ring. As indicated in its 759, the Department feels that it is of the
                            first importance that nothing shall jeopardize the complete breaking up
                            of this ring by the Brazilian authorities and the Department’s
                            alternative suggestion in its 738, March 23, 10 p.m., made with a view
                            to protecting the source of information as far as possible, was and is

                            in your 1000, March 23, 4 p.m., authorized you to give the police such
                            evidence of the nature above referred to as you considered necessary. As
                            your 1224, April 10, 10 p.m. indicated that you had not understood that
                            such authorization had been given you, Department’s 937, April 11, noon,
                            made it clear (in reply to the question in the first sentence of the
                            last paragraph of your 1224) that it did not desire you to continue to
                            withhold the evidence in question from the police. This telegram crossed
                            your despatch of April 11, but on receipt of the latter to make
                            assurance doubly sure Department sent you its 1069 containing its
                            assumption that you had supplied the evidence in question. Your 1413,
                            however, is not directly responsive to the Department’s assumption and
                            leaves us in uncertainty as to whether the police activities are still
                            being handicapped because you feel that you should not furnish them with
                            the evidence in question. To dispel any possible uncertainty, the
                            Department hereby explicitly states that you are authorized to give <pb
                                n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0209"/>the Brazilian police such
                            messages when and as you deem necessary for their activities against the
                            espionage radio rings and Department desires to be informed if and when
                            you have furnished the police with such evidence.</p>

                        <p>1435. Department’s 759, referred to its 738 which while it gave some
                            discretion in handling the source nevertheless made it clear that
                            everything possible should be done to prevent the source of the messages
                            from being jeopardized or destroyed.</p>
                        <p>Department’s 937, April 11, clarified the question of giving this
                            evidence to the police here.</p>
                        <p>The police as you know have arrested and have held these at our request.
                            It was necessary, the more so because as indicated in my 1413 April 25
                            their espionage activities did not constitute a crime while Brazil is
                            not at war, to show the authorities here that we did in fact have “the
                            goods” on them. The police have therefore been given some of the
                            messages in strict confidence, with the request that they be used only
                            to assist in questioning the prisoners, and under no condition, to be
                            published. The form in which the messages have been given to the police
                            to use has been either as a straight translation into Portuguese of
                            these messages when as in the case of the HTT group, they presented an
                            understandable record of the activities of the Hungarian ring, or as
                            quotations in interrogatories prepared for them by the Embassy as was
                            necessary in order to question Engels, von Heyer and Kempter. A selected
                            group of Alfredo’s messages was furnished to the President, to Aranha
                            and to the police. Another group of Alfredo messages dealing with leaks
                            from the Air Ministry was given to Aranha to show to General Eduardo
                                Gomes.<note n="18" xml:id="d188fn18">General Gomes represented

                            difficulty in holding these spies, Dr. Edmundo De Miranda Jordao, head
                            of the Brazilian Bar Association, today made energetic representations

                            April. In view of our doubts as to the discretion of Chilean officials,
                            it seemed better for him to work alone until PYL was finally located.
                            Unfortunate extreme difficulties of terrain, surveillance activities of
                            Nazi organization and sudden irregularities in transmission so far
                            rendered impossible final exact location of station. There is now also
                            the question of locating Noispagzces circuit. Further work held up
                            pending receipt of replacement material requested in my 664, of May 2,

                            civilized laws of human conduct and without distinction among the
                            victims. The lives and property of more and more citizens of the

                            and of the other American Republics now at war, and to undermine the
                            collective integrity and solidarity of the continent.</p>
                        <p>Information regarding a number of particularly dangerous Axis agents has
                            been communicated to the Argentine Government by the Embassy of the
                            United States. Recently a number of Axis agents whose subversive
                            character had been signalized by other American Republics with a view to
                            their deportation and repatriation had entered Argentina on visas issued
                            by Argentine consuls. So far as is known, no measures have been taken to

                        <p>The Argentine Government thus far has taken no action, in accordance with
                            Resolution XL of the Río de Janeiro Meeting, to close all radio
                            telephone and radio telegraph communications between Argentina and the

                            exception of official communications of the American Governments. Nor
                            have effective steps been taken by the Argentine Government to control,
                            through licensing, the transmission and reception of messages over any
                            telecommunication system which might endanger the security of each
                            American state and the continent in general.</p>
                        <p>There appears to be no doubt that subsequent to the severance of
                            telecommunications by the majority of the American Republics, Argentina
                            has been used as a center for the reception of information from Axis
                            agents throughout the Continent, and that such information is
                            transmitted to Axis nations directly or indirectly by
                            telecommunications. Any message so transmitted to Axis nations, either
                            directly or indirectly, may endanger the lives of citizens of the
                            American Republics, threaten the safety of their ships, lead to the loss
                            of valuable materials, and imperil the individual and collective
                            security and integrity of the American Republics.</p>
                        <p>During the past five months the Government of the United States has
                            awaited with serenity and confidence the positive action which it has
                            felt sure would be taken by the Government of Argentina to implement the
                            resolutions subscribed at Río de Janeiro. The Government of the United
                            States does not doubt that this confidence is justified.</p>

                        <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has considered the memorandum presented
                            by the Ambassador of the United States on the 6th instant, regarding the
                            application, on the part of the Argentine Government, of certain
                            resolutions approved at the Meeting of Río de Janeiro. The Ministry
                            believes that only through erroneous information can it be affirmed that
                            the delay in the application of those resolutions “has <pb n="203"
                                xml:id="pg_203" facs="0215"/>permitted the continuance by Axis
                            agents in Argentina of espionage and other activities designed to defeat
                            the war effort of the United States and of the other American Republics
                            now at war, and to undermine the collective integrity and solidarity of
                            the continent”. The energetic official intervention in the few concrete
                            cases thus far known makes it possible to affirm, indeed, that on the
                            part of the Argentine Government there has been no lack of diligence or
                            of interest in the suppression of that kind of situation, which the
                            memorandum, morever, limits itself to indicating in general terms. The
                            Government of the United States may be assured that the Argentine
                            Government will not disregard any concrete denunciation that may be
                            brought to its attention regarding the existence of centers of espionage
                            or of activities dangerous to continental defense.</p>

                            with the Axis countries, any decision should be reserved, subjecting it
                            to previous consultation with this Ministry which, moreover, has in no
                            case authorized the admission of that personnel.</p>
                        <p>With the exception of the diplomatic mission of the United States, no
                            other American diplomatic mission has pointed out the activities of
                            undesirable persons traveling to Argentina. In the only cases formally
                            denounced by the diplomatic mission of the United States, appropriate
                            action has been taken immediately. It is thus that decrees of expulsion
                            have been issued against four German citizens: Carlos Arnold, Walter
                            Giese, Fred von Kockritz Fryland and Enrique Volberg. All have been
                            carried out, excepting that relative to Enrique Volberg, by reason of
                            his being involved in proceedings instituted against him before the
                            Criminal Court of the Capital. By reason of the same denunciations
                            residence in the Republic has been prohibited to Rudolph Borgolte and
                            Augusto Eisner.</p>
                        <p>The Executive Power has just sent to the National Congress a bill to
                            regulate the right of assembly whereby, in accordance with the spirit of
                            Resolution XVII of Rio de Janeiro, there are prohibited assemblies
                            intended to divulge ideas contrary to the system of the National
                            Constitution, of democratic institutions and of the fundamental laws, or
                            tending to supplant that system with any other based <pb n="204"
                                xml:id="pg_204" facs="0216"/>on force or despotism. By the same bill
                            the use of emblems, symbols or printed matter inspired by the same
                            tendencies is suppressed. It is to be noted that the Edict relative to
                            Public Assemblies adopted by the Police of the Capital on June 25, 1941,
                            which is in full force, contains provisions in the same sense.
                            Furthermore, the decree of May 15, 1939 requires all associations
                            functioning in the country to comply with democratic principles and
                            prohibits their depending in any way on foreign governments and
                            entities, provisions which at that time led to the closure of various
                            German institutions.</p>
                        <p>In the Ministry of the Interior there functions a special organization of
                            “Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Argentine Activities” which acts as a
                            centralizing and coordinating organ of police activities intended to
                            control, watch and suppress any activity contrary to the democratic
                            system and the institutions of the country.</p>
                        <p>The Direction General of Posts and Telegraphs, from the point of view of
                            radiocommunications, has adopted effective measures to eliminate, in so
                            far as possible, the clandestine stations as well as transmissions
                            contrary to Resolution XL of the Third Meeting of Foreign Ministers of
                            Río de Janeiro. To this end, by a progressive action of control, the
                            Direction General of Posts and Telegraphs has thus far adopted the
                            following measures: <hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Intensification of the
                            services of radioelectric control for the location and closure of

                            between private enterprises of public telecommunications services.</p>
                        <p>Although there exist radiocommunication companies that maintain direct
                            circuits of public service with the Axis countries and countries
                            occupied by the Axis, they are subject to the control provided for by
                            the laws and regulations which, of course, excludes any activity that
                            may affect continental security.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the strict measures of control adopted by the Argentine
                            Government to watch internal and external movements of funds, for the
                            protection of continental security and solidarity, within a general
                            action to avoid possible future activities on the part of the agents to
                            whom reference is made in the Embassy’s memorandum, are well known.
                            Related to them are the decrees issued by the Executive Power on June 15
                            last, it being possible to state confidentially that in accordance with

                            control in keeping with the resolutions of the Meeting of Río de

                                10,<note n="36" xml:id="d199fn36">Not printed.</note> I have the
                            honor to submit the following observations on the Foreign Office
                            memorandum of July 8 in reply to the points raised in the informal
                            memorandum left by the Ambassador with the Foreign Minister on July 6
                            regarding the implementation of the Resolutions adopted at the Río de
                            Janeiro Meeting of American Foreign Ministers:</p>
                        <p>1. The Foreign Office memorandum does not deny that the Argentine
                            Government has delayed implementation of the provisions of Resolutions
                            I, XVII, XXXI and XL, specifically mentioned in the Ambassador’s
                            informal memorandum, but asserts that “only through erroneous
                            information can it be affirmed that the delay in the application of
                            those resolutions ‘has permitted the continuance by Axis agents in
                            Argentina of espionage and other activities designed to defeat the war
                            effort of the United States and of the other American Republics now at
                            war, and to undermine the collective integrity and solidarity of the
                            continent’”.</p>
                        <p>2. With reference to the activities of Axis agents in Argentina, the
                            Foreign Office memorandum states that the Government has just sent to
                            the Congress a bill to regulate the right of assembly “in accordance
                            with the spirit of Resolution XVII of Río de Janeiro”. In response to my
                            request, Dr. Bunge of the Foreign Office furnished <pb n="206"
                                xml:id="pg_206" facs="0218"/>me with a mimeographed copy of this
                            bill, on which the original date appeared as June 26, 1941. This date
                            had been crossed out and the date July 4, 1941 superimposed with a
                            rubber stamp. Dr. Bunge’s attention was called to the fact that this
                            copy was dated a year ago, although the Foreign Office memorandum stated
                            that the bill had just been submitted to the Congress. He appeared a bit
                            disconcerted and undertook to investigate this apparent discrepancy. He
                            has since informed me that the bill in question was in fact submitted a
                            year ago, but since no action was taken on it before adjournment, it has
                            now been resubmitted with slight alterations. The Embassy has been
                            promised an accurate copy of the bill as now submitted to Congress but
                            has not as yet received it.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office memorandum also refers to the existence of a special
                            organization in the Ministry of the Interior to centralize and
                            coordinate police activities for the suppression of “any activity
                            contrary to the democratic system and the institutions of the country”.
                            The organization in question is under the direct control of the Under
                            Secretary of the Interior, Dr. Castells, who has on several occasions
                            stated to members of the Embassy that the organization has been unable
                            to function because no funds have been made available. To date there has
                            been very little indication of any disposition on the part of this
                            organization or any other agency of the national Government to take any
                            effective steps to suppress activities of the kind described on the part
                            of Axis elements in Argentina; the energies of the police authorities
                            have been devoted rather to the suppression of “Communist activities”
                            and to restricting the activities of prodemocratic organizations under
                            the provisions of the existing State of Siege.</p>
                        <p>3. The Foreign Office memorandum gives assurance that “the Argentine
                            Government will not disregard any concrete denunciation that may be
                            brought to its attention regarding the existence of centers of espionage
                            or of activities dangerous to continental defense,” and adds that in the
                            only cases brought to its attention by this Embassy, appropriate action
                            has been taken immediately. The foregoing statement is correct so far as
                            is known with reference to four cases, those of Carlos Arnold, Walter
                            Giese, Fred von Kockritz Frydland, and Enrique Volberg. With reference
                            to the cases of Rudolph Borgolte and Augusto Eisner, however, the
                            Embassy has only now been informed verbally that the police authorities
                            have been asked to take steps to expel them from the country. In this
                            connection, reference may also be made to the case of the Spanish
                            Falangist agent Joaquin Miquelarena, who came to Argentina from Spain
                            several months ago as a representative of the Spanish news agency EFE.
                            As reported in the Embassy’s telegram No. 625, <pb n="207"
                                xml:id="pg_207" facs="0219"/>April 8, 3 p.m.,<note n="37"
                                xml:id="d199fn37">Not printed.</note> the Foreign Office explained
                            that although it had originally instructed the Argentine Embassy in
                            Madrid not to grant a visa to Miquelarena, it had subsequently
                            authorized the issuance of a diplomatic visa to him in view of the fact
                            that the Spanish Government had granted him a diplomatic passport and
                            had manifested particular interest in the case. Dr. Bunge himself
                            referred to this case in my conversation with him early this week,
                            citing it as the only instance in which the Argentine Government had
                            made an exception to permit the admission of a person signalized by this
                            Embassy as being an Axis agent.</p>
                        <p>4. With reference to the admission of Axis agents from other American
                            countries into Argentina, the Foreign Office memorandum states that, in
                            accordance with Resolutions II, VI and VII of the Meeting of Habana, the
                            Ministry of Foreign Relations on June 27, 1941 instructed Argentine
                            diplomatic missions in America to refer to the Ministry all requests for
                            passport visas for consuls and employees who had been serving in offices
                            closed by reason of the severance of relations with the Axis countries,
                            adding that in no case has the admission of such personnel been
                            authorized. It is noted that the foregoing statement makes no reference
                            to Axis agents not directly employed in consular offices. Although the
                            Embassy has received no detailed information in this regard from other
                            American republics, reference may be had to the reports submitted by the
                            Embassy at La Paz (despatches Nos. 2066 and 2075 of May 4 and May 7,
                                1942,<note n="38" xml:id="d199fn38">Neither printed.</note>
                            transmitted to this Embassy with the Department’s strictly confidential
                            instruction No. 2549 of June 16, 1942<note n="37" xml:id="d199fn39">Not
                                printed.</note>) which refer to the “general exodus to Argentina of
                            Axis nationals who have been designated by the Bolivian Government for
                            expulsion”.</p>
                        <p>In this same connection it may be pertinent to observe that the entry of
                            Axis agents into Argentina is not, of course, confined to persons coming
                            from other American Republics. For some time all indications have
                            pointed to the fact that a large number of Axis agents have been
                            entering Argentina from Europe on Spanish vessels (Reference: Embassy’s
                            despatch No. 4071 of February 5, 1942<note n="37" xml:id="d199fn40">Not
                                printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>5. With reference to telecommunications with Axis countries and
                            territories subservient to them, the Foreign Office memorandum states
                            that “the Direction General of Posts and Telegraphs, from the point of
                            view of radiocommunications, has adopted effective measures to eliminate
                            in so far as possible the clandestine stations as well as transmissions
                            contrary to Resolution XL of the Third Meeting of <pb n="208"
                                xml:id="pg_208" facs="0220"/>Foreign Ministers of Río de Janeiro”.
                            This assertion is directly contradicted by the action of the Argentine
                            Minister of the Interior who on July 10, two days later, addressed a
                            note to the Director General of Posts and Telegraphs inquiring whether
                            his agency was in a position to undertake the pertinent measures of
                            control in accordance with the provisions of Resolution XL. The Embassy
                            is of the opinion that the situation remains as stated in its despatch
                            No. 5431 of June 12, 1942,<note n="41" xml:id="d199fn41">Not
                                printed.</note> namely, that although the Argentine authorities
                            appear disposed to cooperate in the detection and elimination of
                            clandestine radio stations, they have taken no action to close
                            telecommunications between Argentina and the Axis countries.</p>
                        <p>6. The Foreign Office memorandum makes no reference to the point raised
                            in the Ambassador’s informal memorandum of July 6 regarding travel by
                            Axis agents on Argentine air lines in contravention of the provisions of
                            Resolution XXXI of the Río de Janeiro Conference.</p>
                        <p>7. The Foreign Office memorandum makes no reference to the point raised
                            in the Ambassador’s informal memorandum regarding the continued
                            dissemination of pro-Axis propaganda by certain newspapers, radio
                            broadcasting stations and publishing houses in Argentina.</p>
                        <p>8. The Foreign Office memorandum makes a point of mentioning the “strict
                            measures of control adopted by the Argentine Government to watch
                            internal and external movements of funds, for the protection of
                            continental security and solidarity”. The financial measures adopted by
                            the Central Bank for the avowed purpose of implementing Resolution V of
                            Río de Janeiro have been the subject of numerous reports by this Embassy
                            within the past few weeks. In view of the fact that at least certain
                            preliminary steps had been taken to this end, no mention of Resolution V
                            was made by the Embassy in its informal memorandum of July 6. The extent
                            and significance of the measures taken in this connection by the
                            Argentine Government will be made the subject of subsequent reports.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion it may be said that the statements contained in the Foreign
                            Office memorandum of July 8 do not, in the opinion of the Embassy,
                            justify the assertion in the last paragraph thereof that “the Argentine
                            Government has instituted, in defense of the security of the continent,
                            a plan of control in keeping with the resolutions of the Meeting of Río
                            de Janeiro”. On the contrary, the Embassy is of the opinion that the
                            action that has been taken in this regard is negligible, and that the
                            true intentions of the Argentine Government are best revealed by its
                            recent actions in connection with the sinking of the <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>1662. Yesterday the Minister of the Interior announced with great
                            publicity the discovery of a Nazi spy ring which was directing and
                            working with Lun[ing]<note n="43" xml:id="d200fn43">German spy in
                                Cuba.</note> in Cuba and engaged in maritime espionage, using a
                            fishing fleet operating in Chilean waters. He announced the expulsion of
                            three German citizens Kleiber, President of the Banco Germánico and
                            prominent in Santiago, and Ludwig Russbenzinger and Guillermo
                            Dorbachbunge, the latter “engaged in fishing business” in San Antonio.
                            The Government announcement states that the information was sent to Cuba
                            over “a short wave station” avoiding direct mention of Trans-radio
                            Chilena. A Chilean, Carlos Robinson, was detained temporarily but it is
                            understood cannot be sentenced since Chilean legislation punishes only
                            espionage against Chile and not espionage activities directed against
                            other nations.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Foreign Minister’s request for legal action against
                            Subercaseaux, journalist, for having allegedly made “false” statements
                            regarding Nazi activity in Chile and false accusations of Chilean
                            governmental complacency with regard to such activities, the Communist
                                <hi rend="italic">Siglo</hi> accused Barros Jarpa of having
                            protected the spy ring during the recent 8 day period in which he held
                            the portfolio of the Interior during the absence of the Minister. Barros
                            Jarpa today issued another declaration asserting that the more important
                            information regarding the discovery of a spy ring was brought to the
                            attention of the Government “after my stay in that Ministry”. Questioned
                            by the press as to whether in view of the exposure of Nazi activities
                            the Government case against Subercaseaux would be dropped Barros Jarpa
                            is quoted as saying that “any rumor of the withdrawal of the Government
                            charges is unfounded since the matter of the arrest of spies was
                            entirely separate from the former dispute”, adding that Subercaseaux had
                            made assertions which referred to activities of officials of the
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs and it was in this particular the charges
                            were made. He added however “I have nothing more to do with this case
                            which is in the hands of the judges”.</p>

                                    profound gratitude and renewed encouragement that eleven of the
                                    other republics of the Americas are joined with us, side by
                                    side, in the war and that seven other republics have severed all
                                    relations with the Axis and are rendering their neighbors who
                                    are at war every form of cooperation and assistance. It is true
                                    that the remaining two republics of the twenty-one have still
                                    refrained from carrying out the unanimous recommendations of the
                                    Inter-American Conference of Río de Janeiro, in which they
                                    themselves joined, that all of the Americas sever all relations
                                    with the Axis, and are still permitting their territory to be
                                    utilized by the officials and the subversive agents of the Axis
                                    as a base for hostile activities against their neighbors. As a
                                    result of the reports on Allied ship movements sent by these
                                    agents, Brazilian, Cuban, Mexican, Colombian, Dominican,
                                    Uruguayan, Argentine, Chilean, Panamanian, and United States
                                    ships have been sunk without warning while plying between the
                                    American republics, and as a result many nationals of these
                                    countries have lost their lives within the waters of the Western
                                    Hemisphere. But I cannot believe that these two republics will
                                    continue long to permit their brothers and neighbors of the
                                    Americas, engaged as they are in a life-and-death struggle to
                                    preserve the liberties and the integrity of the New World, to be
                                    stabbed in the back by Axis emissaries operating in the

                                    cases duly reported.</item>

                                <item>To point out that it is inconceivable that Mr. Welles should
                                    thus have made a charge the inconsistency of which is evident
                                    from the most casual observation of the events in our country.
                                    As regards the sinking of merchant ships, it is sufficient to
                                    point out that those being sunk are either leaving our ports or
                                    arriving from foreign ports, and that the sinkings always occur
                                    at great distances from Argentine waters. Hence, it is difficult
                                    to understand how they can necessarily be attributed to the
                                    reports sent from Argentina.</item>

                                <item>To point out that the statements in question are particularly
                                    inopportune at a time when the Argentine Government, gradually
                                    broadening the measures called for by the Río de Janeiro
                                    recommendations in so far as Argentina’s position and needs
                                    permit, has declared under State control all telecommunication
                                    enterprises, companies, and lines operating in the territory of
                                    the Republic, a measure adopted in a Ministers’ Resolution prior
                                    to Mr. Welles’ speech, considering “that the state of war in
                                    which various American countries find themselves and the
                                    commitments resulting from Pan American agreements signed by the
                                    Republic render it advisable to adopt the necessary measures to
                                    prevent the telecommunication system operating in national
                                    territory from being used to the detriment of the military
                                    interests of those countries.”</item>

                        <p>A–276. This airgram is a confirmation and amplification of the Embassy’s
                            telegram 1989 of October 13, 11 p.m.<note n="45" xml:id="d202fn45">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Following observations are made for the Department’s consideration in
                            studying the advisability of turning information regarding clandestine
                            radio groups over to the Argentine Government for appropriate
                            action.</p>
                        <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0224"/>
                        <p>There is reasonable certainty that the Germans are aware that we are
                            acquainted with some aspects of their local military espionage set-up.
                            Local press despatches have carried in part details of confessions in
                            Brazil of Friedrich Kempter (LIR–MAX), Gustav Albrecht Engels (CEL–ALD)
                            and Nils Christensen (CIT). In such despatches there was included
                            information that Americans were responsible for the arrests of agents in
                            Brazil, that codes had been captured when arrests were made (i. e., <hi
                                rend="italic">La Razón</hi> stated that one code was based on <hi
                                rend="italic">All This and Heaven Too</hi>), that information
                            regarding Allied plane, ship, and troop movements had been sent by them
                            to Germany via clandestine radio.</p>
                        <p>On the few occasions that we have requested action on the part of the
                            Argentine authorities in deporting Axis agents Argentina has complied,
                            although slowly. Examples are Walter Giese (Greif of LIE-MAX), and
                            Hubert Kemper. On another occasion Immigration Department had granted
                            immigration permits to Hans Emil Andress, Ewald Koch and Kurt Bruening,
                            suspected Axis agents in Peru. Upon representations this Embassy,
                            Ministry Foreign Affairs canceled their permits within 24 hours.
                            However, we have been careful to request action in only the most
                            flagrant cases, and not the cases of clandestine radio groups. Also the
                            Argentines have been extremely slow to take action, even when evidence
                            overwhelming. It was 3 months before Giese was deported and some 8
                            months before Kemper was interned, an internment which is not yet
                            thought to be satisfactory. In addition, Special Investigating Committee
                            of Chamber of Deputies has presented Government with much more detailed
                            and convincing evidence regarding other local Axis agents. Government
                            has almost completely ignored Committee’s findings. This has been main
                            factor dictating Embassy’s policy of caution in recommending withholding
                            of information regarding local radio groups from Government.</p>
                        <p>However, much can be gained by presenting this information to the Foreign
                            Office, signalizing that Argentina’s neutrality has been compromised by
                            these agents, and requesting that appropriate steps be taken to
                            apprehend and punish the persons involved. This would serve purpose of
                            illustrating that neutrality is not enough and that there does exist in
                            Argentina subversive organizations which are using the country as a base
                            for carrying out operations against Argentina’s interests as well as the
                            interests of the other American nations. The effect it would have on the
                            Argentine people and Congress would be tremendous. At the same time it
                            would constitute a direct answer to the Argentine Government’s request
                            for specific instances of local German espionage. Also Germany’s
                            reaction to possible Argentine punitive measures probably would be of
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>Although it is very likely that due to developments in Brazil and <pb
                                n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0225"/>Chile the Germans have
                            dismissed some of their most exposed agents and have changed their
                            systems somewhat, it is practically certain that the arrest or exposure
                            of their leaders here would entail a complete reorganization of their
                            local set-up with a consequent 6 months or more interruption in their
                            reporting services.</p>
                        <p>It is thought that to submit as convincing an argument as possible it
                            would be necessary to attach to the list of agents a general history of
                            their activities. Of inestimable benefit in this direction would be the
                            inclusion of a few copies of some of the translations of the intercepted
                            clandestine telegrams. These would preferably include a few illustrating
                            the transmission of reports regarding ship movements (including
                            Argentine ships), the ones regarding the bribery (or attempt at bribery)
                            of an Argentine army officer by Ottomar Müller (Otis) of the LIE–MAX
                            group, the one about Walter Freiwald and the plan to attach time bombs
                            to the bottom of ships in Buenos Aires harbor, the one regarding the
                            establishment of a clandestine radio transmitter in Buenos Aires by
                            Miiller, of his dismissal and replacement by Hans Napp (Berko), of
                            Napp’s visit to the German Naval Attaché for instructions, how the
                            clandestine transmitter was obtained from Siemens, of the post office
                            cover boxes local agents used, and other messages of similar character.
                            Of course, no mention would be made of the persons or messages connected
                            with the CES–NOI group, RDN group, PYL–REW group, or the German
                            diplomatic messages. Only those persons and telegrams connected with the
                            CIT, CEL–ALD, HTT and LIE–MAX groups would be mentioned. It is taken for
                            granted that the Germans have continued operations on the basis that the
                            Americans have obtained copies of the codes and confessions of the
                            persons connected with the last mentioned groups.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy would appreciate the opportunity of drawing up into practical
                            form a draft of the representations (with all supporting memoranda and
                            documents) to be made to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; this draft to
                            be submitted to the Department for its approval before action being
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>In summary it is pointed out that this draft would contain no information
                            which the Germans presumably do not already realize we have in our
                            possession. It is possible, of course, that the Germans do not realize
                            the Embassy is acquainted with the names, identities and locations of
                            the persons implicated as being agents.</p>
                        <p>In this connection it would be appreciated if the Department could have
                            the Embassies at Santiago and Rio de Janeiro and the FBI in Washington
                            furnish all pertinent information which they think would be helpful for
                            inclusion in the draft. For example, two Integralistas were recently
                            arrested in Brazil. These two men confessed that they had been in
                            contact with Thilo Martens in Buenos Aires. <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214"
                                facs="0226"/>Thilo Martens has long been suspected by this Embassy
                            as being identical with the Thilo mentioned in the CEL–ALD group. If for
                            no other reason, copies of these two confessions would be of great
                            benefit for the carrying out of local investigations.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Chile called to see me this afternoon at his urgent
                            request.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador told me that President Ríos had called him on the
                            telephone that afternoon at three p.m. and that the Ambassador’s
                            conversation with the President had been rendered almost impossible
                            through the interruptions of the censorship officials, who had prevented
                            the Ambassador from speaking on any of the important and urgent subjects
                            which it was necessary for him to discuss with President Ríos. I
                            expressed to the Ambassador my profound regret and told him that I would
                            have an immediate investigation made since there was not the slightest
                            justification for any official of this Government to interfere with the
                            conversation between the Chief Executive of an American Republic and his
                            diplomatic representative.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that, owing to the attacks made upon him in Chile
                            under the instigation of Dr. Barros Jarpa, his Foreign Minister, he, the
                            Ambassador, had yesterday cabled his resignation to President Ríos and
                            had informed the President that he felt that the office of Ambassador in
                            Washington should be placed at the disposal of the President. He said
                            that President Ríos had telephoned him in order to let him know that he
                            was not accepting his resignation, that he had his entire confidence and
                            he desired him to remain in Washington.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed the belief that Dr. Barros Jarpa would be forced
                            to resign in the immediate future and that, presumably, a full Cabinet
                            reorganization would take place. He said that President Ríos had made it
                            clear to him on the telephone that he desired to break relations with
                            the Axis powers.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then inquired whether I did not believe that President
                            Ríos intended to break relations with the Axis, had he undertaken his
                            trip to the United States, upon his return to Santiago. I replied that I
                            had no doubt that this was the desire of President Ríos but that of
                            course the Ambassador would remember that upon very many occasions in
                            the past this Government had been advised to the same effect and that,
                            nevertheless, regrettably enough, no action had been <pb n="215"
                                xml:id="pg_215" facs="0227"/>taken. I said furthermore that it had
                            generally been understood in Santiago in the early days of this month
                            that the Chilean Government believed that it would be very difficult for
                            any action of the nature of breaking relations with the Axis to be taken
                            immediately after the return to Santiago of President Ríos due to the
                            fact that if it were taken immediately after his return it would be
                            interpreted as action taken under pressure from the United States. To
                            this, the Ambassador made no reply.</p>
                        <p>I then stated that I had noted with considerable surprise during the past
                            few days official allegations on the part of the Chilean Government that
                            the statements which I had publicly made in my address in Boston<note

                            been conveyed to the Chilean Government through diplomatic channels, and
                            also that this Government had never advanced to the Chilean Government
                            any concrete evidence that Axis activities in Chile were being carried
                            on which were detrimental to the defense interests of the United States
                            and the other Republics of the Hemisphere. I said that these statements
                            seemed to me inexplicable in view of the fact that as far back as the
                            30th of last June the Government of the United States, through
                            Ambassador Bowers, had furnished Dr. Barros Jarpa in writing a very
                            lengthy and complete relation of the information in the possession of
                            this Government concerning Axis activities in Chile,<note n="48"
                                xml:id="d203fn48">For a summary of this document, see <ref
                                    target="#pg_225">p. 225</ref>.</note> pointing out that these
                            activities involved the sending of the most dangerous information
                            regarding ship movements from South America to the United States. I
                            stated that again in August supplementary evidence had been presented
                            and that this action had been repeated even later. I said the facts
                            therefore were that upon three occasions this Government had informed
                            the Chilean Government precisely and in detail of these facts through
                            the diplomatic channels, and that consequently, the Chilean Government
                            not only had the facts four months ago but that the diplomatic approach
                            had been used three times without any results forthcoming until exactly
                            the time my address was delivered.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed great surprise and said that he had never known
                            this before. He asked why I had not informed him. I said that I was
                            frank to confess that I had assumed, when he was in Santiago in August,
                            that these facts had been brought to his personal attention by his own
                            Government inasmuch as this was one of the most serious problems under
                            consideration by our two Governments, and that I had also assumed that
                            Ambassador Bowers had discussed this question with him. I said that I
                            believed that these assumptions were valid assumptions on my part but
                            that I of course regretted now that the question had not been raised in
                            conversations between the <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0228"
                            />Ambassador and myself. In any event, I said, his Government had been
                            in possession of these concrete facts and it was all the more
                            regrettable for that reason that Dr. Barros Jarpa should publicly and
                            officially state that no concrete evidence had been presented to the
                            Chilean Government.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador talked for the better part of an hour and he concluded by
                            expressing his belief that the whole problem would soon be
                            satisfactorily solved and that the foreign policy of Chile would be
                            modified as soon as the Cabinet change took place. He expressed great
                            chagrin over the attitude taken by the press in the United States and I
                            merely remarked that I felt the Ambassador knew this country so well
                            that he must realize that when the people of the United States were
                            engaged in a desperate war such as this, they could not take lightly the
                            threat to the safety of the whole Hemisphere which resulted from the
                            situation I had set forth in my address in Boston. I expressed the
                            earnest hope that the difficulties of the moment would soon be past and
                            that the relations between our two countries would continue to be as
                            close and understanding and cooperative as it had always been the desire
                            of this Government and of myself personally that they should remain.</p>

                            culmination of previous presentation of evidence to the Chilean
                            authorities, is based on unquestionable evidence obtained by officers of
                            this Government. It was handed personally by Ambassador Bowers to Dr.
                            Barros Jarpa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile, on June 30, 1942.
                            After that date, for two months, the Government of Chile took no
                            significant action to restrain the activities set forth in this
                            memorandum, and a period of two months elapsed before any reference was
                            made to this memorandum by the Chilean authorities to the
                            Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>During September and October, and after the contents of the memorandum
                            had been brought by Ambassador Bowers to the personal attention of the
                            President of Chile, the Chilean Government has <pb n="217"
                                xml:id="pg_217" facs="0229"/>made a few arrests and seized one
                            clandestine transmitter. In general, however, no vigorous or adequate
                            action has been taken on the basis of the information contained in this
                            memorandum or with regard to subversive persons and conditions well
                            known both to this Government and to certain Chilean authorities.</p>
                        <p>Over a period of months, this Government has loyally and patiently drawn
                            the attention of the Chilean Foreign Minister to these matters, all this
                            time making no other use of this material, since although it was aware
                            of the unusual conditions confronting the Chilean Government, it was
                            confident that Axis activities in Chile would be adequately and promptly
                            dealt with.</p>
                        <p>You are requested personally to present to the Foreign Minister of Brazil
                            one of the enclosed copies of the memorandum presented on June 30 to the
                            Foreign Minister of Chile. In so doing, you are requested to take the
                            opportunity to explain orally and in full the circumstances set forth
                            above. You will wish to bear in mind, during this conversation, the
                            importance of stressing the fact that Mr. Welles’ recent public remarks
                            concerning the tolerance of Axis activities by the Government of
                                Chile<note n="51" xml:id="d204fn51">Department of State <hi

                            were made only after this Government had sought to avail itself of all
                            other means of obtaining the cooperation of the Chilean Government. In
                            addition, you may find it appropriate to point out that the danger
                            arising from the conditions referred to in this memorandum has to do
                            primarily not with shipping to and from Chilean ports, but with the use
                            of Chilean soil as a relay point for the transmission of enemy espionage
                            messages leading to the sinking in distant waters of vessels of this and
                            other American republics, and to the furnishing of information
                            prejudicial to the defense of the Americas.</p>
                        <p>The Department will advise you by cable when the action contemplated in
                            the foregoing paragraphs of this instruction should be carried out. <hi

                            herewith the drafts of the memoranda proposed to be given to the
                            Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the activities of German
                            agents connected with the clandestine radio groups in Argentina. The
                            documents are attached to the memoranda.</p>
                        <p>It will be noticed that the memoranda contain information regarding the
                            individuals suspected of having connection with these espionage groups
                            which has not been reported to the Department. This information, as well
                            as names of additional suspects, has only recently been received. In
                            spite of the fact that Friedrich Kempter (Koenig) refused to identify a
                            photograph of Hans Napp, additional information recently obtained
                            identifies him more clearly as being identical with Berko of the LIR–MAX
                            group, and the Embassy believes more strongly than ever that Hans Napp
                            is the person involved. For example, it has been definitely established
                            that Hans Napp is an agronomist by profession and that in this capacity
                            he has been manager of several <hi rend="italic">estancias</hi> in
                            Argentina and Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>From newspaper articles the impression has been gathered that the
                            information concerning the PYL–REW group has been presented to the
                            Chilean Government. If this is the case, the Department may desire to
                            consider the possibility of enclosing with the memorandum on Group IV a
                            few of the telegrams sent over station PYL–REW. This would strengthen
                            the cases against Herman Bauer (who is closely connected with Heriberto
                            Schwartau Eskildsen (Enrique) and Friedrich Tadeo von
                            Schulz-Hausmann.</p>
                        <p>The contents of the enclosed memoranda have been compiled from the files
                            of this Embassy and from local sources. It is realized of course that
                            this information may be subject to revision or addition upon the receipt
                            of further reports on the same subject from the Federal Bureau of
                            Investigation and from the Embassies in Rio de Janeiro and Santiago, but
                            the opportunity is taken of submitting the available material at this

                                known to be using at least four groups of espionage agents in
                                Argentina. These four groups are not isolated entities; they work
                                    <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0231"/>in connection and in
                                collaboration with similar groups which have been established in
                                varying degrees of importance in almost all the other American
                                Republics. Formerly Brazil was the most important scene of
                                operations of these groups, but due to recent restrictive measures
                                in that country, they lost most, if not all, of their agents and
                                equipment. Those few agents who escaped arrest went into hiding or
                                fled to neighboring countries. It is known that at least two of them
                                are in Argentina at present. Since the punitive measures taken by
                                the Brazilian Government, the German High Command has come to look
                                upon Argentina and one other American country as the new
                                headquarters for its espionage organizations.</p>
                            <p>Through information regarding the activities of these agents which
                                has come to the attention of the Government of the United States it
                                has been possible to learn that the Germans have used couriers on
                                Spanish and other neutral ships, the diplomatic pouches, and the
                                facilities of ordinary mail for transmittal of their information
                                between the United States and South America. The information sent by
                                mail is usually forwarded in secret ink or in cleverly worded
                                business or social letters. This information, is then transmitted
                                from the South American countries by clandestine radio to the German
                                High Command in Germany.</p>
                            <p>In carrying out their espionage work the Germans endeavored to
                                secure, and in some instances actually secured, the services of the
                                citizens of South American countries. The Germans have also resorted
                                to bribery of police and other government officials in their
                                espionage activities. They have attempted to place friendly
                                officials in military and other delegations which have gone from the
                                Latin American countries to visit the United States. These German
                                agents also use secret post office boxes, which are usually secured
                                under Spanish names and changed frequently. They also utilize the
                                post office boxes of Nazi party members and of German commercial
                                companies for the purpose of transmitting espionage reports.</p>
                            <p>A number of the main espionage agents have diplomatic status and are
                                actually attached to the German Embassies as attachés. Particularly
                                is this true of the Naval and Military Attachés. It is also noted
                                that some of the principal espionage agents are Nazi party leaders
                                and are known as such.</p>
                            <p>The Germans made extensive use of the Italian Lati Trans-Atlantic air
                                line for the transmission of espionage mail and for travel of
                                espionage agents until the Lati Line was suspended on December 18,
                                    1941.<note n="53" xml:id="d205fn53">See <ref

                                utilize the services of these clandestine radio stations in

                                />definitely known that the German Embassy in Rio de Janeiro used
                                the station belonging to Group I for sending messages to the Foreign
                                Office in Berlin.</p>
                            <p>The chief types of information transmitted by these clandestine
                                radios are: ship arrivals and departures; movement of warships of
                                the fleets of the United States and England; information on imports
                                and exports of the countries covered; information on United States
                                armament and industries; political information on the area covered;
                                weather reports; movements of airplanes of the United States,
                                especially those being ferried to Africa via Natal; information
                                concerning the operations of the Pan American Airways; information
                                transmitted on behalf of the German Embassies; information on war
                                preparation of the United States; information on the Panama Canal;
                                information on the activities of the United States in connection
                                with military and other aid furnished to the countries of the west
                                coast of South America; information on the defense measures taken by
                                the Latin American countries; details of information concerning the
                                British base at Trinidad; information concerning maritime
                                regulations and instructions of the United States; information
                                regarding sabotage on English ships; military information concerning
                                the United States, particularly concerning torpedo nets and naval
                                installations; and information on convoys of merchant vessels.</p>
                            <p>The work done by these agents has been extremely accurate and
                                especially harmful to the Allied powers as well as to the neutral
                                American Republics. Millions of dollars worth of ships, merchandise,
                                petroleum, munitions and foodstuffs have been sent to the bottom of
                                the sea due to the efforts of these agents. Much of this property
                                belonged to countries still on friendly relations with the Axis
                                powers. These agents are also directly responsible for the loss of
                                the lives of hundreds of men, women and children who died when their
                                ships were destroyed by German torpedoes.</p>
                            <p>There are attached four memoranda setting forth in detail information
                                concerning the identities and activities of the individuals guilty
                                of participation in the foregoing activities which took place in
                                Argentina. Each memorandum covers a separate group of German
                                espionage agents operating under orders of the German High Command.
                                For want of a better name, these groups are referred to as Group I,
                                Group II, Group III and Group IV. It is pointed out that not all of
                                the guilty persons have been located or identified and only the
                                names of those are included regarding whom there is a reasonable
                                certainty that they are to some degree guilty. These groups include
                                the names of the following persons, many if not all of whom used
                                code or cover names to disguise their activities: <pb n="221"

                            <p>As evidence of the activities of these agents, there are also
                                enclosed copies of some of the messages which these groups sent to
                                Germany via illegal radio transmitters.<note n="54"
                                    xml:id="d205fn54">None printed.</note> These messages are sorted
                                according to the group which transmitted them. Inasmuch as the
                                Germans probably are not aware that copies of these messages are in
                                the possession of the Government of the United States, it is
                                requested that they be regarded as strictly confidential and be
                                treated with the greatest of care.</p>
                            <p>It is regretted that due to military exigencies it is not possible to
                                enclose copies of the messages sent by Group IV, but it is hoped
                                that copies can be supplied in the near future.</p>
                            <p>In addition, since the ramifications of the espionage groups in
                                Argentina are directly connected with the success of the war effort
                                of the United Nations and directly affect the security of the bases
                                which the Allied powers have in various sections of this hemisphere,
                                it is respectfully requested that the Argentine Government keep the
                                Government of the United States informed as to the progress and
                                findings of the action that Argentine Government takes regarding the
                                matter.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Espionage Group</hi> I</p>
                            <p>This group of espionage agents operates in Argentina under the
                                direction of the German High Command and in close cooperation with
                                Captain Dietrich Niebuhr, German Naval Attaché in Buenos Aires.
                                Although Group II is believed to be the most important espionage
                                group as regards the whole of South America, Group I <pb n="222"
                                    xml:id="pg_222" facs="0234"/>appears to have been the most
                                active in Argentina. Its present chief appears to be one Hans (Juan
                                Jacobo) Napp, who uses the code name of Berko to disguise his
                                activities. He appears to have centered the headquarters of his

                                Scheckenbach and Osvaldo Hirner may be operating with Napp.
                                Scheckenbach is owner of the Viena Hotel, Calle Lavalle 368, where
                                the chief agents of Groups I and II of Argentina and Brazil met for
                                several conferences in 1941. Napp once resided at the Hotel Viena.
                                Osvaldo Hirner is reported to work under the orders of Scheckenbach
                                and is located in La Plata where he obtains information regarding
                                the arrivals and departures of refrigerator ships of the Allied
                                nations. He was formerly an employee of the police department in La
                                Plata. He is reported to have been responsible for the sinking of
                                the <hi rend="italic">Andalucia Star</hi> by a German submarine soon
                                after it departed from La Plata a few weeks ago. Scheckenbach is
                                reported to be one of the chiefs of port espionage in Buenos

                            <p>Group I, which is believed to have an illegal radio transmitter in or

                                including reports on boat arrivals and departures; movement of

                            <p>Group II, as well as the other three espionage groups known to be
                                operating in Argentina, had its headquarters formerly in Brazil, but
                                with the recent widescale measures of the Brazilian Government most
                                of its agents in that country were arrested and the seat of its
                                activities were transferred to Argentina. This same thing is true of
                                Groups I and III.</p>
                            <p>The local chief of Group II is believed to be Captain Dietrich
                                Niebuhr, German Naval Attaché in Buenos Aires. He uses the code name
                                of Diego to cover his activities in this group. Although Group II is
                                believed to be practically as large in its ramifications as Group I,
                                it has not been possible to date to uncover as many of its agents.
                                However, it was very active and has sent much information of a <pb
                                    n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0235"/>strategic and harmful (to
                                the Allies) nature to the German High Command. It is believed to
                                have a clandestine radio transmitting station at its disposal in or
                                near Buenos Aires.</p>
                            <p>The information Group II transmitted to its superiors in Germany
                                included: Boat arrivals and departures (but not as much as Group I);
                                movements of United States war planes; exports and imports;
                                movements of warships of the United States and England; military
                                activities and preparations of the Brazilian Government; operations
                                of Pan American Airways; political information; and information on
                                war preparations in the United States.</p>

                            <p>Group III of the German espionage agents acting in Argentina under
                                the orders of the German High Command is not indicated as having
                                been as active as either of Groups I, II and IV. However, very
                                little is known about this group or its leaders, and it may be for
                                this reason that its activities appear to be less than the
                                activities of the other groups. Suffice it to say, however, that the
                                arrests of the principal characters of the Brazilian branch of this
                                group have revealed that it did have an important organization in
                                Argentina, transmitting information regarding ship movements and
                                other Allied military activities in the hemisphere to the German
                                High Command in Germany. At least one of the members of the
                                Brazilian branch of Group III escaped arrest and fled to Argentina
                                where he is now in hiding. It is possible that either Rodolfo Hepe
                                or Rolf Edmund Stickforth may be able to clear up the mystery of his
                                whereabouts. His name is Dr. Heinz Treutler.</p>
                            <p>The principal information transmitted by Group III concerns boat
                                arrivals and departures; information on the British base at

                                concerning the United States and particularly torpedo nets and naval
                                installations; and information on convoys of merchant ships.</p>

                            the situation stands, the Embassy in Buenos Aires has been authorized,
                            as you recall, to prepare a memorandum for presentation to the Argentine
                            Government, after first clearing the text with us. Not only are Santiago
                            and Rio sending such supplementary data on subversive activities as may
                            hook up with those in the Argentine, but a very comprehensive memorandum
                            prepared by the F. B. I.<note n="59" xml:id="d206fn59">Not
                                printed.</note> was sent down by courier yesterday to the Embassy in
                            Buenos Aires. This memorandum was produced at the last moment just in
                            time to get the outgoing mail and at FC’s request I initialed the
                            instruction without reading the enclosure, with the promise that they
                            will make a photostat available to us later on.</p>
                        <p>The question of releasing the material to the Argentine Government seems
                            primarily a political one, as the Germans undoubtedly know that we have
                            a good deal of this material and they have probably already discounted
                            it in advance. I fear the Embassy is over-sanguine in its belief that
                            German espionage operations might be completely disrupted for six
                            months. In any case, I have told him that any general publicity should
                            of course be postponed until we see whether the Argentine Government is
                            going to act on the information tendered to it.</p>

                        <p>This memorandum presents detailed and irrefutable evidence concerning the
                            activities of 18 Nazi espionage agents in Chile and other persons
                            associated with them in various ways in their activities.</p>
                        <p>Information was given the Chilean Foreign Minister as to the manner of
                            operation of these agents on Chilean soil, as to their identity,
                            associations, whereabouts, means of concealment, and other pertinent
                            details.</p>

                        <p>Especially, detailed information was given to the Foreign Minister in
                            this memorandum concerning the types of information which these agents
                            send from Chile to Germany clearly showing the danger which their
                            transmission constitutes to the security and shipping of many of the
                            other American republics, including the United States. To quote from the
                            memorandum itself, “the following types of information have been
                            transmitted to Germany: <list>

                        <p>The memorandum clearly shows that these agents in Chile relayed to
                            Germany information received from other Axis agents operating in
                            Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru,
                            Venezuela, and the United States.</p>
                        <p>Evidence is contained in this memorandum that this ring of agents in
                            Chile transmitted to Nazi spies in the United States instructions for
                            their activities against the security of this country and the
                            hemisphere, and helped to arrange for the development of communications
                            and the obtaining of secret materials used by agents within the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Certain members of this ring of agents operating on and from Chilean soil
                            are shown in this memorandum to have made frequent journeys to other
                            American republics in order to assist in the organization and
                            maintenance of espionage activities.</p>
                        <p>Clear evidence was presented to the Foreign Minister that this ring of
                            agents had received from Germany instructions to undertake the
                            employment as spies and traitors to their own countries of nationals of
                            American republics, including Chile itself.</p>
                        <p>Specific information was given to the Chilean Foreign Minister concerning
                            the use of the Chilean mails by such agents, especially in their
                            contacts with agents in other American republics, including the United
                            States. Even post-office box numbers in Chile were given.</p>
                        <p>It was shown that this espionage group had well-established contacts with
                            Nazi agents operating in the Far East, contacts carried on with the
                            assistance of the Japanese. The names of persons who carried on this
                            activity were given, along with much detail.</p>
                        <p>Information was given in detail concerning relations of this Nazi
                            espionage ring, including Chilean citizens, to Japanese espionage agents
                            in South America.</p>
                        <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0239"/>
                        <p>Information was given concerning the person who had been charged with
                            developing a system of agents in the coastal towns of Chile for
                            reporting on ship movements in those ports to be transmitted to
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>Information was given to the Foreign Minister of Chile concerning the
                            organization on Chilean soil of a unit directed by a secret section of
                            the High Command of the German army, charged with sabotage. This
                            activity, organized on and directed from Chilean soil, affects not only
                            Chile, but also the republics of southern South America and the West
                            Coast.</p>
                        <p>There follow some details as to personalities and the working of the
                            system.</p>
                        <p>As is well known, a principal interest of German espionage is the
                            collection of information with regard to the movements of United Nations
                            and neutral shipping. In Chile, the pattern was very similar to that
                            established by German intelligence in many parts of the world. An
                            important espionage center was the Chilean branch of the North German
                            Lloyd, Compañía Transportes Marítimos. The Chilean company has legally
                            severed its relationship with the Norddeutscher Lloyd, but the espionage
                            activities continued. The system was developed by a North German Lloyd
                            official, manager of the Compañía Transportes Marítimos, Friedrich von
                            Schulz-Hausmann. Schulz-Hausmann has since moved to Buenos Aires, where
                            he is active as a Nazi espionage agent.</p>
                        <p>The German manager succeeding Schulz-Hausmann was Bruno Dittmann, who was
                            arrested last week in Chile, along with certain other employees of the
                            Compañía Transportes Marítimos. Numerous other spies, some of them in
                            key positions, have had contact with this office. Although there was no
                            German shipping business in Chile, a large staff was maintained.</p>
                        <p>The pattern of this kind of activity has now become well-known. German
                            commercial firms acting as blinds for espionage activities maintain
                            contact with some member of the German diplomatic mission in the country
                            in question. Such was the case in Chile, the officer of the Embassy
                            being Ludwig von Bohlen, Air Attaché. Also concerned was Walter
                            Boettger, the German Commercial Attaché. Boettger is also a high
                            official of the Nazi Party in Chile, having at one time been
                            Landeskreisleiter.</p>
                        <p>Bohlen cooperated closely with Japanese agents, maintaining close contact
                            with the Japanese Military Attaché in Santiago, an important figure in
                            Japanese espionage. Bohlen also made use of the diplomatic pouch of an
                            ostensibly neutral nation. Also deeply implicated was the German Consul
                            General at Valparaiso, von Pochhammer.</p>
                        <p>Thus, the participation of German diplomatic and consular personnel was
                            completely demonstrated.</p>
                        <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0240"/>
                        <p>This group in Chile had contact with the German spy Luning, now under
                            sentence of death in Cuba, also with other known German agents in Cuba,
                            as well as in a number of the American republics, including the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Thoroughly linked with elements of German espionage throughout the
                            hemisphere, and having extraordinary facilities for communication with
                            Germany, the Nazi spy ring in Chile was set up to act as a transmitting
                            agency for espionage information going from the Western Hemisphere to
                            Germany. It was not concerned primarily with reporting to Germany on
                            matters Chilean, but with ship movements in many parts of the world and
                            with the development of the world potential and military, naval and
                            industrial activities of the United States. However, in numerous
                            instances, information which was specifically damaging to Chilean
                            national interest was conveyed by the spies to Germany.</p>
                        <p>In order better to cover up its activities, this ring drew in a number of
                            Chilean citizens of German extraction, notably from the solid German
                            districts of south central Chile.</p>
                        <p>Not only in Cuba have agents connected with this ring been apprehended,
                            but also in the United States, Brazil, and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that all this time, owing to the fact that Chile
                            maintained diplomatic relations with the Reich, it was possible to
                            transmit such espionage material to Germany through the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>This group in Chile was in contact with Walter Giese, in Ecuador, who was
                            expelled by that country some time ago, fled to Argentina and has
                            returned to Europe. The ring was also connected with an agent arrested
                            and expelled by the government of Peru.</p>
                        <p>The financing of operations was carried out through the firm of O.
                            Osterloh in Valparaiso, which maintained an account in the Banco Alemán
                            in Buenos Aires. Money was actually distributed by various means. On one
                            occasion, funds were transported for this ring by a Japanese
                            diplomat.</p>
                        <p>From time to time, especially since June 30 (when this memorandum was
                            handed to the Chilean Foreign Minister), further detailed information
                            has been given to the government of Chile on the activities of enemy
                            agents.</p>

                            should perhaps be given to notice which such publicity would give Axis
                            agents involved. Even public knowledge of fact our Government has
                            communicated to Argentine Government detailed information on this
                            subject might result in causing agents and others involved to take
                            cover. Furthermore, if information communicated to Argentine authorities
                            not effectively used by them they might offer excuse their efforts
                            frustrated by premature publicity. If Argentine authorities <pb n="230"

                        <p>Reference is made to the Memorandum left by the Ambassador of Argentina
                            with the Acting Secretary of State on October 10, 1942 with regard to
                            certain statements made by the Acting Secretary of State in an address
                            before the National Foreign Trade Convention on October 8, 1942.</p>
                        <p>The Memorandum in question states, among other things, that the Argentine
                            Ambassador has been instructed to indicate that the Argentine Government
                            has learned of the aforesaid statements with profound displeasure since
                            they are not consonant with the state of relations between the two
                            countries and because they do not specify concrete cases and therefore
                            only constitute unfounded assertions.</p>
                        <p>In reply, it may be recalled that the Foreign Ministers of the Twenty-one
                            American Republics at Río de Janeiro in January 1942<note n="68"

                            decisions because they recognized that, in view of the aggression
                            committed against the hemisphere by the Axis powers, there should be a
                            rupture of all relations, diplomatic, financial and economic, and a
                            severance of all telecommunications between the American republics and
                            those powers.<note n="69" xml:id="d214fn69">For resolutions of the

                            decision was taken because the American republics realized from the
                            experience of the European neutrals overrun by the Axis and from the
                            perfidious activities of the Japanese in Asia and in Pacific areas that
                            the mere existence of the aforesaid relations and communications was a
                            guarantee that they would be used and abused, under the direction of the
                            diplomatic representatives of the Axis powers in complete disregard of
                            the norms governing the conduct of such representatives in international
                            law, to further sabotage, espionage and other activities directed
                            against the lives and properties of the nationals and governments
                            fighting for a cause which the American republics have embraced, by
                            their official acts, as their own cause.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the Argentine Government, simultaneously with
                            the delivery of the Memorandum of October 10 by Ambassador <pb n="232"
                                xml:id="pg_232" facs="0244"/>Espil, made a public statement setting
                            forth most of the considerations contained in the Memorandum, and
                            specifically questioning the existence of widespread Axis espionage
                            groups in Argentina, the American Ambassador in Buenos Aires has
                            delivered to the Argentine Foreign Minister a statement, a copy of which
                            is Attached,<note n="70" xml:id="d214fn70">Drafts of memoranda, <ref
                                    target="#pg_218">p. 218</ref>.</note> summarizing certain
                            information which has come to the attention of the Ambassador regarding
                            Axis espionage rings operating in Argentina.</p>
                        <p>The information contained in this statement describes in some detail the
                            activities of four groups of German espionage agents, all of which now
                            appear to have their headquarters in Argentina. Approximately thirty
                            agents have been identified. There is no doubt from the messages which
                            have been intercepted, a number of which are included with the
                            statement, that these groups are intimately connected with the German
                            High Command from whom they receive their instructions. In addition
                            their connections with the German Embassy in Buenos Aires through the
                            offices of the Military and Naval Attachés, who took an active part in
                            the direction of these groups, have been well established.</p>
                        <p>The activities of these groups consist principally in the gathering of
                            information either locally or from agents in other American republics
                            and the transmission of this information to Germany. Among the subjects
                            treated in radio messages which have been intercepted are the following:
                            arrivals and departures of United Nations’ and neutral shipping,
                            including war vessels of the United Nations; reports on United States
                            armament and industries and on the military and naval activity of the
                            United States and Brazil; weather reports; movements of United States
                            aircraft, both military and commercial; information on United Nations’
                            bases in the Caribbean. Of particular significance were intercepted
                            messages disclosing discussions as to possible methods of sabotage of
                            United Nations’ shipping through activities in the port of Buenos Aires,
                            with obvious peril to the port itself.</p>
                        <p>The attached statement describes activities undertaken by Axis agents in
                            Argentina prejudicial to the security of the American republics as a
                            whole. Since it is of vital interest that information concerning such
                            activities be made available to the governments and peoples of the
                            American republics, the Government of the United States feels free to
                            make such distribution of the present memorandum and its attachment as
                            it may deem desirable.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Espil stated that he felt the step taken by this Government was in
                            the highest degree desirable. He said he was only sorry that this step
                            had not been taken a long time ago.</p>
                        <p>I reminded the Ambassador that during the first days of July Ambassador
                            Armour had informed the Argentine Foreign Minister that this Government
                            was aware in the most detailed manner of Axis activities detrimental to
                            the vital defense interests of the other American Republics which were
                            going on within Argentina and that at that time the Argentine Government
                            had taken practically no steps whatever to do anything to correct this
                            situation. I said that if, under similar conditions, the Argentine
                            Government had communicated a message of that importance to this
                            Government, I did not believe the Ambassador could conceive of this
                            Government refusing to take any action whatever.</p>
                        <p>I said there was no use of mincing words with regard to the position of
                            the present Argentine Government. It was constantly giving lip service
                            to the principles of the Good Neighbor Policy and to the ideal of
                            inter-American solidarity, and yet, at the same time, it was not only
                            permitting a desperately serious situation of the kind now complained of
                            to continue, but it had also, to all intents and purposes, refrained
                            from any practical implementation of the definite commitments which the
                            Argentine Government made at the Río de Janeiro conference. I said that
                            so long as the Argentine Government refused to comply with this official
                            obligation to eliminate all means of telecommunication between the Axis
                            agents in Argentina and the outside world, just so long would this most
                            serious aspect of danger to which this Government was referring continue
                            to exist in Argentine territory.</p>
                        <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0246"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador spoke for a while with regard to domestic developments in
                            Argentina. He asked if the Department had any particular information
                            concerning recent political developments and I said that all of the
                            information which we had was covered very fully in newspaper articles
                            which had appeared during the past few days.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated at the conclusion of our talk that his own position
                            had become almost intolerable and that he hoped earnestly that the
                            document now communicated to the Argentine Government would not be made
                            public if the Argentine Government took effective and prompt steps to
                            correct the situation complained of. He said that publication of a
                            document of this character could only increase bad feeling against
                            Argentina within the United States and within the other American
                            Republics. I replied that I could make no commitment of any kind on that
                            point. I said that as the Ambassador and I both must frankly admit, the
                            situation was not one created by the United States or by any other
                            American Republic, but was solely a result of the failure of the
                            Argentine Government to live up to its inter-American agreements and
                            that the question of publication or non-publication of this document
                            must therefore be left open.</p>

                        <p>2182. I am disturbed by AP despatch originating Montevideo and published
                            in local press last night and this morning to effect that source close
                            to Committee on Political Defense announced memorandum similar to

                            Argentina would be released to press within next few days. Because of
                            prompt and effective cooperation being extended by Argentine
                            authorities, as explained in my 2178, November 4, 9 p.m. I strongly urge
                            that no publicity be given out or material at least for time being. I
                            understand that several arrests have already been made and that first
                            raids brought out copies of telegrams on ship movements and other

                                statements that had already been made public in the United States on
                                the same subject, which naturally does not prevent the information

                                of July 8 last, to the effect that the Government of the United
                                States may be assured that the Argentine Government will not

                        <p>1659. From the Under Secretary. Your 2173, November 4, 4 p.m.<note n="77"
                                xml:id="d220fn77">Not printed.</note> I delivered the duplicate
                            memorandum to Espil yesterday, telling him that you had already the
                            previous evening delivered the copy thereof to Ruiz-Guiñazú.</p>
                        <p>Espil urged that no publication be given to this document, alleging that
                            publication thereof would intensify ill-will against Argentina, <pb
                                n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0249"/>not only in the United States
                            but in the other American republics as well. I told him that the
                            Argentine Government itself was solely responsible for the present
                            situation and that I could make no commitment whatever with regard to
                            withholding publicity.</p>
                        <p>I wish you would telegraph me your views as to the most desirable time
                            for the presentation of the document to the Inter-American Defense
                            Committee. It had been my thought that approximately November 12 would
                            be an expedient date. It would seem to be unwarranted from every
                            standpoint for this Government to make public the facts concerning Axis
                            activities in Chile and not to make public documentation covering
                            similar activities in Argentina.</p>
                        <p>I wish you would also telegraph me your opinion as to the public reaction
                            in Argentina if this document is published. My own judgment would be
                            that it would decidedly strengthen the hands of all of the elements who
                            are opposed to the present course in foreign policy pursued by the
                            Argentine Government. But I realize, of course, that you are a far
                            better judge of this question. [Welles.]</p>

                        <p>1892. Supplementing seemingly extempore statement published yesterday
                            accompanying news reports from Montevideo and extensive extracts from
                            memorandum handed Chilean Government June 30 concerning Axis espionage
                            activities in Chile, whose text was made public by the Emergency
                            Advisory Committee on Continental Defense, Minister of Interior Morales
                            Beltrami furnished to the press last night an official statement
                            published in full today. Principal points follow:</p>
                        <p>Given memorandum obliges Chilean Government to make a statement on the
                            subject and to take steps which would otherwise have been postponed
                            until a more appropriate time. The memorandum transmitted to Ministry of
                            Interior by Foreign Minister July 8 but steps had already been taken to
                            locate clandestine radio transmitter in Valparaiso and certain other
                            data were already known to Chilean Government. During July the Minister
                            of Interior by express authority of President was engaged in organizing
                            investigation service competent to handle such matters and memorandum
                            served to accelerate organization so that in August the chief of the
                            service received instructions to exhaust all means to obtain proof of
                            the allegations; in October the efforts were successful and a powerful
                            illicit radio transmitter <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0250"/>was
                            seized and complicity of numerous aliens established; these were
                            detained at the disposition of the Court of Appeals of Valparaiso. The
                            Government’s investigations are not yet finished since it is desired to
                            establish all the connections and ramifications of the espionage web; at
                            the same time the Government wished to have the courts establish certain
                            facts beyond a doubt in order to avoid criticism that steps had been
                            taken without adequate proof; for this reason the Government has taken
                            steps to ascertain what officials gave out information prematurely to
                            the Valparaiso press about a week ago concerning the measures taken
                            there; the publication of the memorandum has precipitated events in a
                            way that the Minister of Interior had attempted to avoid and for this
                            reason he is compelled to make known to the public steps taken by the
                            Government which it might have been better to conceal for a few days
                            more; the expulsion decrees prepared by the Government on November 2
                            when the complete data concerning the trial in Valparaiso were at hand
                            will be carried out now that no further reason for secrecy exists in
                            view of the wide publicity given the matter; consequently the Government
                            has issued decrees expelling from the country the following German
                            nationals for the reasons given reserving the right to adopt additional
                            measures when the pending investigations are terminated: (1) Hans

                            operated; he is port captain of the Compañía de Transportes Marítimos.
                            As he has been found guilty his expulsion will not take effect until
                            final sentence is pronounced. (2) Johannes Abries Peter Szeraws,
                            technician in charge of transmission. He is an ex-member of the crew of

                            in Chile. Is at present a fugitive and his whereabouts unknown. (3) Hans

                            manager of the Compañía de Transportes Marítimos, center of espionage in
                            Valparaiso. Is this successor of Friedrich von Schulz von Hausmann
                            considered as the chief of espionage in Chile. (6) Walter Irritier
                            Adler, intimate friend of Reiners with whom he shares a post office box.
                            His close friendship with preceding and his complicity in the illicit
                            radio transmission has been established. (7) Otto Buchholz Hunold, in
                            whose place of business the condensers and transformers of the
                            transmitter were discovered. Former employee of the Compañía Transportes
                            Marítimos. (8) Horst Kettler Schuke, employee of the code section of the
                            German Consulate in Valparaiso gave orders for the transmission. (9)
                            Jorge Hasseldeck Schwerdfeger, assistant manager <pb n="239"

                        <p>2189. Embassy’s 2182, November 5, 3 p.m. Police have arrested Martin
                            Schneider, Osvaldo Hirner, Victor Amil Caritestoni, Otto Hein and Egon
                            Bunze. Homes of Schneider, Hans Napp, Ricardo Hoffmann, Martin Schwartz,
                            José Mella Alfageme and Compañía Din, have been searched. No results
                            except with Schneider and Hoffmann. Many documents found in possession
                            of former, including voluminous material on ship arrivals and
                            departures, cargoes, armament et cetera. Additional documents written in
                            German now being translated. Documents in possession of Hoffmann look
                            suspicious but police say they must be translated first.</p>
                        <p>Schneider claims documents found in his possession not his, but entrusted
                            to his safekeeping by a friend named William Hans. Claims not to know
                            where Hans lives. Minister of Interior says obvious Schneider is lying
                            and that he intends to hold him under arrest for “few more days” and to
                            try to “squeeze” him into confession. José Mella is not in Buenos Aires
                            at present. Is in Córdoba on vacation. Documents in possession Schwartz
                            prove relationship with Napp.</p>
                        <p>In addition telephones Ludwig Buchwald, Rodolfo Hepe, von Schulz-Hausmann
                            and Rolf Edmund Stickforth have been tapped by police. Post office boxes
                            nos. 1081 and 386 have also been covered. Minister Interior stated he
                            will order immediate arrest of Ottomar Müller, Hans Napp, Walter
                            Freiwald, Georg Hohenstein and Hermann Bauer.</p>
                        <p>It is thought that publication in Montevideo of memo on espionage in
                            Chile and published announcement that similar report may be forthcoming
                            regarding Argentina may have given local agents warning to do away with
                            incriminating evidence.</p>

                        <p>1667. From the Under Secretary. Your telegram 2182, November 5, 3 p.m.,
                            crossed my personal telegram to you on the same subject. No publicity
                            will be given to the memorandum except by instruction of the Department.
                            I will appreciate your keeping me very closely posted with regard to the
                            action taken by the Argentine Government on the basis of our memorandum
                            as well as with respect to action taken generally to clean up Axis
                            activities in Argentina. The responsibility for ferreting out Axis
                            subversive activities and vigorously prosecuting them must rest with the
                            Argentine Government. Our memorandum was intended to demonstrate to the
                            Argentine Government the various types of activities which are taking
                            place. Even though the Argentine Government takes steps now to clean up
                            all of the activities described in our memorandum, the situation will
                            still be totally unsatisfactory unless the Argentine Government,
                            utilizing all of the information which it has, undertakes on its own
                            initiative to stamp out all of the Axis activities today going on in
                            Argentina, many of which, of course, we have no knowledge of. I think it
                            important that the Argentine authorities be made aware of our point of
                            view in the premises. [Welles.]</p>

                        <p>2194. For Under Secretary. Your 1659, November 5, 5 p.m. My first
                            impression is that November 12th would be too early a date for
                            publication and suggest at least another week. As reported in my 2189,
                            November 5, 10 p.m., authorities here acted promptly and made several
                            arrests and raids, but the sincerity, extent, and effectiveness of their
                            further action remains to be seen. Minister of Interior outlined to me
                            yesterday steps he has taken, stated that incriminating documents were
                            seized in connection with arrests made, and promised to keep Embassy
                            informed of developments of investigation. In view of this I should like
                            to have more time to gauge how far Government really proposes to go in
                            arresting, confining, or expelling Axis agents and putting into effect
                            measures to stop communications with Axis countries and further to
                            implement other Rio commitments. In my opinion Argentine public reaction
                            in general would be favorable <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0253"
                            />to publication, particularly if full opportunity had been given
                            authorities to act on information conveyed in our memorandum. Premature
                            publication might be interpreted even by our friends here as indicating
                            we were more interested in showing up Government than in having Axis
                            agents apprehended and activities stopped.</p>
                        <p>Virtually all influential papers would probably receive such disclosures
                            enthusiastically although under state of siege they might not be able to
                            give full expression to their feelings.</p>

                            content of the memorandum. Such a simple statement would not only put an
                            end to all sorts of speculation but would also let the Argentine public

                        <p>The Argentine Ambassador called to see me this morning at his request.
                            The Ambassador told me that he understood from Mr. Duggan<note n="79"
                                xml:id="d228fn79">Laurence Duggan, Adviser on Political

                            given him on November 4 covering the document containing the detailed
                            statement of Axis activities in Argentina had not been communicated to
                            the Argentine Government and that he had consequently cabled down the
                            full text of this memorandum. I told him that I had already made it
                            clear to the Ambassador that while the <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> of November 4 which I had given him was not
                            identical with the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> transmitted by
                            Ambassador Armour to the Argentine Foreign Minister on November 3, it
                            was similar and contained precisely the same general presentation of
                            views of this Government. I gave the Ambassador to read telegram 2183,
                            November 5, 4 p.m., from Ambassador Armour which communicated the text
                            of the reply of the Argentine Foreign Minister to the <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> of November 3 presented by Ambassador Armour and
                            in which the Argentine Government expresses the desire that the
                            memorandum covering Axis activities in Argentina be kept secret.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then handed me a memorandum,<note n="80" xml:id="d228fn80"
                                    ><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> attached herewith, in
                            which the Argentine Government stated that it “understands that secrecy
                            is essential for the purposes of the investigation being <pb n="243"
                                xml:id="pg_243" facs="0255"/>conducted and that those purposes, by
                            reason of their importance and because of their interest for continental
                            security and for the security of the country, should outweigh the
                            reasons set forth in the United States Government’s memorandum for
                            giving publicity to the memorandum, the diligent consideration of which
                            has not been delayed in the slightest degree by the Argentine
                            Government.”</p>
                        <p>The Argentine Government in this memorandum continues by stating that
                            “once the investigation already commenced is terminated, the Argentine
                            Government would consider the desirability of publishing by common
                            accord the results obtained which would give rise to rigorous measures
                            and to the proper punishments.”</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Argentine Government states “The results of the
                            proceedings now initiated as a result of the information which has just
                            been furnished to the Argentine Government is of interest, as stated
                            above, not only to the continent, but also especially to Argentina
                            because of reasons of her own security.”</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador inquired what reply he should make to his Government.</p>
                        <p>I stated textually that in the view of the Government of the United
                            States it is a cause of great gratification that the Argentine
                            Government has now appreciated the importance to the security of the
                            entire continent that Axis activities of this nature be “rigorously
                            suppressed”. I continued by stating that I was informed by Ambassador
                            Armour that the Federal police authorities in Argentina had already
                            undertaken action against the individuals whose names were set forth in
                            the memorandum communicated to the Argentine Government and that in
                            certain cases a very considerable mass of incriminating evidence had
                            already been obtained. I said I hoped that the most rigorous steps
                            possible would be taken by the Argentine Government to bring those
                            guilty to trial so that they might be appropriately dealt with.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then asked if I would not give the assurances requested by
                            his Government, namely that the memorandum transmitted to his Government
                            should not be made public. I stated that I regretted that this
                            Government could not make any commitment in that sense at this time.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador insisted that such a commitment should be made. I again
                            reiterated that I was unable to give such a commitment since the
                            fundamental question involved was one of the utmost gravity to the
                            security of the entire hemisphere and not only to the security of the
                            United States itself.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that he wished to see Secretary Hull about the
                            matter in order to see if the Secretary of State would not give him the
                            commitment sought.</p>
                        <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0256"/>
                        <p>I said that I was sure the Secretary would be very glad to see him but
                            that I believed that he would receive the same reply from Secretary Hull
                            that he had received from me.</p>

                            October 10, 1942, the information handed on November 3rd by Ambassador
                            Armour specifying for the first time the facts pointed out by the
                            Undersecretary of State in his Boston address, was passed immediately to
                            the Police authorities, who some hours later initiated the necessary
                            investigations. Ambassador Armour is aware of this, as well as of the
                            first impressions derived from these steps.</p>
                        <p>As expressed to Ambassador Armour when acknowledging receipt of his
                            memorandum, on which occasion the assurances mentioned above were
                            reiterated, the Argentine Government deems highly advisable that the
                            information furnished to them be maintained and closely examined in
                            strict confidence as being conducive to the objectives in view.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine Government holds that this is essential to the aims of the
                            investigations and that these aims, both in view of their importance and
                            significance as regards the security of the Continent and of the country
                            itself, should prevail over the reasons adduced to circulate and publish
                            a memorandum the diligent consideration of which by the Argentine
                            Government has not been delayed a single moment.</p>
                        <p>On completion of the investigations already commenced, the Argentine
                            Government would consider the publication, in mutual agreement, of the
                            results thereof, results which may necessitate the adoption of the
                            measures and the enforcement of the penalties deemed fitting.</p>
                        <p>The success of the proceedings undertaken as a result of the information
                            just furnished to the Argentine Government interests, as <pb n="245"
                                xml:id="pg_245" facs="0257"/>already stated, not the Continent alone
                            but specially Argentina by reason of its own security.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, any premature publicity might bring about results
                            concerning which the Argentine Government deems it a duty to state that
                            it declines all responsibility.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: With reference to our
                            conversation of this afternoon I have now received from Ambassador
                            Armour the reply to the inquiry which I sent him on November 5<note

                            herewith for your reference, particularly the part which I have
                                marked.<note n="82" xml:id="d230fn82">The marking referred to does
                                not appear on file copy of reply, telegram No. 2194 of November 6, 7

                        <p>I feel we should not only avoid making any commitments at this time with
                            regard to nonpublication of the memorandum, but that we should also
                            emphasize at every opportunity that the facts brought to the attention
                            of the Argentine Government affect the security of all of the other
                            American republics as well as our own security and that the basic
                            question involved is one which has already appropriately been placed in
                            the hands of the Inter-American Defense Committee in Montevideo.</p>
                        <p>I know that you will bear in mind in talking with the Argentine
                            Ambassador that the Inter-American Defense Committee has already made
                            public the memorandum covering Axis activities in Chile, and that we
                            could therefore hardly in principle agree to take a more favorable
                            position with regard to Argentina than we have with regard to Chile.</p>

                        <p>2207. Embassy’s 2206, November 7, 4 p.m. Following are results of
                            conversation between Minister Interior and Vice Consul English this
                            afternoon.</p>
                        <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0258"/>
                        <p>George Hohenstein von Lug confessed his and Ottomar Müller’s guilt
                            probably implicating others. Walter Riewald [<hi rend="italic"
                                >Freiwald</hi>] owns yacht anchored hundred yards from shore in
                            River Plate. From his statements police believe radio transmitter to be
                            aboard but low water precludes their boarding it now; it is under
                            vigilance of guards on shore until water rises. Ottomar Müller arrested.
                            Hans Napp escaped.</p>
                        <p>It is strange that police raided Napp’s home and office November 4th but
                            waited until 6th before trying to make arrest. Embassy had Napp under
                            surveillance all this time and until evening of 6th Napp frequented
                            usual haunts, showed no sign of alarm. Müller and Freiwald also under
                            Embassy surveillance but police finally arrested them.</p>
                        <p>Culaciati<note n="83" xml:id="d231fn83">Argentine Minister of the
                                Interior.</note> claims radio in possession Hirner not a
                            transmitter.</p>
                        <p>Culaciati has refused two offers of Embassy to loan Embassy official to
                            cooperate with police. He stated frankly that reason was he did not wish
                            police to know Americans had anything to do with the matter. This
                            implies that memorandum not given to police and that police consequently
                            unable judge importance of matter or intelligently question agents after
                            arresting them. Culaciati exhibits considerable lack of knowledge
                            regarding progress being made. When asked if von Schulz-Hausmann or
                            Thilo Martens arrested answered “many agents have been detained”.
                            Hausmann and Martens have much influence in official and social
                            circles.</p>
                        <p>Several letters obtained from Hausmann P. O. Box not very interesting.
                            One is from P. Lock and Cía. Casilla 1286 Santiago Chile. Buchwald’s
                            safe deposit box in National City Bank opened; nothing of interest.
                            Buchwald still at large.</p>

                            messages by radio for countries without American continent. This would
                            permit messages in clear by radio. Free use of cable by Missions for
                            cipher messages would be permitted, but presumably Axis Governments
                            would not wish to use this medium. Minister felt one of advantages is
                                [<hi rend="italic">of</hi>] <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0259"
                            />forbidding cipher by radio would be assistance in locating clandestine
                            station.</p>
                        <p>(2) Minister assured me Minister of Interior and Chief of Police are
                            working vigorously on information furnished our memorandum and hoped we
                            would give them sufficient time to complete investigation before
                            insisting on full publicity. He stated they have 11 men under arrest and
                            incommunicado and are working on 20 other cases. He has urged speed and
                            hopes investigation will be completed within week or 10 days when they
                            propose full publication.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime he will discuss at Cabinet meeting Thursday statement
                            referred to in Department’s 1681 November 7, 9 p.m. announcing fact that
                            reply has been submitted by our Government. I am to see him again Friday

                        <p>At lunch yesterday, Dr. García Arias<note n="87" xml:id="d233fn87"
                                >Argentine Minister in Washington.</note> argued eloquently and at
                            length against any further publication of material gathered by this
                            Government concerning espionage and subversive activities in the other
                            American republics. He said that the Argentine authorities are now
                            taking these matters very seriously, but that any publication, directly
                            or indirectly, of data which we had gathered would merely furnish
                            ammunition to extreme nationalist elements to say that, apparently, our
                            own counterespionage activities were carried on with as little regard
                            for Argentine sovereignty as the alleged Axis activities.</p>
                        <p>I am personally of the opinion that there would be nothing to be gained
                            at this time by having the Committee for Political Defense publish the
                            memorandum we furnished the Argentine Government recently.</p>

                        <p>2271. Embassy’s 2264, November 13, 7 p.m. In conversation with Foreign
                            Minister last evening he indicated that while he expected that
                            investigation would be completed by the middle of next week, some time
                            would probably be required to examine evidence secured before
                            publication of a summary of this would be possible.</p>
                        <p>He insisted that eventually, and he hopes as soon as possible, there
                            would be full publicity made of the findings. He seemed to think that
                            Government would appoint a special tribunal (junta) to go over evidence
                            and decide procedure to be used against those incriminated. He said that
                            18 suspects have thus far been arrested and are being held
                            incommunicado.</p>
                        <p>Now that a statement has been made public by the Government that our
                            memoranda have been presented the Department may wish to give thought to
                            date for submission of these memoranda to the Defense Committee in
                            Montevideo provided this procedure still being considered. Once
                            Government here informs us that their investigation has been completed
                            there would seem no longer any reason to defer publication unless
                            Argentine Government has some valid <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249"
                                facs="0261"/>reason why further delay would seem indicated. It might
                            be that if the Government could expedite publication of their findings
                            these could be made simultaneously with publication of our
                            memoranda.</p>

                        <p>2286. Our 2271, November 14, 3 p.m. Minister of Interior informs me that
                            Foreign Minister has apparently secured President’s approval for
                            appointment of military tribunal under the President to investigate Axis
                            activities in Argentina including evidence brought out in our memoranda.
                            Ruiz Guiñazú told Culaciati that he felt such a move would make a good
                            impression in United States.</p>
                        <p>Culaciati told Ruiz Guiñazú that he was against such a committee as this
                            was a matter falling within the jurisdiction of his Ministry. He hopes
                            to have suggestion quashed. He said move was undoubtedly aimed at
                            Chamber Investigating Committee. Furthermore, he feared officers charged
                            with such duties might be unfavorable to our cause.</p>
                        <p>I said it seemed to me this made it even more imperative that he should
                            terminate investigation as soon as possible and publish findings even
                            though they might not be in final and complete form, adding I thought it
                            probable my Government would shortly have our memo published. I am to
                            see him again tomorrow morning.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime report has come to me that Cabinet is this afternoon to
                            discuss question of publication of information contained in our memo and
                            findings resulting therefrom.</p>

                        <p>2302. Our 2286, November 16, 8 p.m. Napp arrested last night. This due
                            efforts provincial police, not capital police. Happened as follows:
                            provincial police assigned Napp case November 12 after local police
                            failed. Two officers provincial police who have cooperated with us for
                            several months called on Embassy yesterday for advice. We supplied all
                            our information on possible whereabouts Napp and made suggestion as to
                            how search should be conducted. <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0262"
                            />The officers followed our advice to letter and 6 hours later took Napp
                            into custody at his home.</p>
                        <p>Provincial police plan to keep Napp’s arrest secret for few days until
                            they have secured confession from him. They must deliver him to local
                            police as soon as it is known he is arrested. So far he has admitted
                            connection with Friedrich Kempter and Ottomar Müller and Informadora
                            Rápida but denies knowledge of Rata, Berko, Otis, Koenig. He states he
                            knows Müller attempted to purchase bomb sight from Argentine official.
                            Disclaims knowledge of Walter Freiwald’s activities, but knows him.
                            Admits he is agronomist by profession and knows nothing of business
                            matters, stating has lost his shirt on various attempted business deals.
                            Admits he was on propaganda program with Müller over Radio Callao.</p>

                        <p>1762. Your 2286, November 16, 8 p.m., and 2271, November 14, 3 p.m. The
                            Department will continue to give careful consideration to the
                            advisability of publishing the memorandum delivered by you to the
                            Argentine Government regarding Axis activities. However, under present
                            circumstances, it appears that publication in the immediate future by
                            the Montevideo Committee would not be necessary. If the Argentine
                            Government publishes the essential information contained in these
                            memoranda and take effective steps to stop the activities disclosed
                            therein, there would seem to be nothing to be gained by the proposed
                            publication. The attitude of the Department is, therefore contingent
                            upon the steps which the Argentine Government may take and concerning
                            which the Department is confident you will report fully.</p>

                        <p>It should be mentioned that in spite of the explanation of the Minister
                            of the Interior that he did not desire the Embassy to cooperate with the
                            police because it was not desired that even the police know the
                            Americans were involved in the matter, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
                            gave a statement to the public explaining that the American Embassy had
                            delivered three memoranda regarding the activities of Axis agents in
                            Argentina and that arrests were being carried out based on the
                            information contained in the memoranda. This would indicate that there
                            is either (1) a serious divergence of opinion among the government
                            leaders as to the action which should be taken against these agents, and
                            that as a consequence some sort of compromise was made, implying that a
                            middle course is being pursued in these investigations whereby it is
                            hoped to arouse neither the ire of Germany or the United States, or (2)
                            it was not desired that the Embassy be in a position to know the
                            intimate details of the investigations being carried out and thus see
                            the inefficiency or lack of sincerity of the Argentine Government. It is
                            possible that a little of both conclusions apply, but the fact that in
                            spite of repeated requests we have not yet received any information of
                            value from the Argentines would indicate that they [at] least wish to
                            cover up some phases of the investigations.</p>

                            <p>I called on the Minister of the Interior by appointment this
                                afternoon at 3:30. I first handed Dr. Culaciati a list of questions
                                which Mr. English had prepared for use by the police in questioning
                                certain of the Nazi agents mentioned in the memorandum handed to the
                                Government. I also gave him a list of the leading figures mentioned
                                in the memorandum showing that out of 44, only 14 had actually been
                                arrested or detained for questioning. Thirdly, I handed him a list
                                of seven leading firms, only one of which—DIN—had been, to our
                                knowledge, investigated thus far.</p>
                            <p>I then went on to discuss with Dr. Culaciati the great importance of
                                having the Government proceed vigorously and rapidly in making
                                arrests, searching premises, and in general bringing the case to a
                                head <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0264"/>as soon as possible. I
                                told him that my Government was considering publishing the
                                memorandum and that while I was prepared to recommend a delay
                                sufficient for them to make a thorough investigation on the basis of
                                facts presented, it was asking a good deal of my Government to
                                refrain from publication unless they had concrete evidence presented
                                of results to date.</p>
                            <p>In my presence he called up Galatto, Chief of the Secret Police, and
                                Morano, and told them both that he wished to have as soon as
                                possible a report on the results to date. This he promised me he
                                would send to the Foreign Minister in time for him to give it to me
                                when I called on the latter at 6 p.m. tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>The Minister told me that the evidence secured to date had been very
                                voluminous and many of the documents in German would require some
                                time for translation. I asked him whether their investigations had
                                been carried into the Province of Buenos Aires, and he replied
                                somewhat evasively to the effect that this was somewhat difficult
                                but pointed to the La Plata raid on Hirner as evidence of some
                                action in the Province.</p>
                            <p>I asked the Minister whether our memorandum had been shown to the
                                police. He said that it had not, as he did not feel it advisable to
                                let the police know at this time that our Embassy had come into the
                                case. I said that I thought it must be difficult for the police to
                                carry on an intelligent and coordinated investigation without having
                                read the memorandum, and having an opportunity to know how the
                                various elements were co-related.</p>
                            <p>I was impressed by a total lack of any system in the methods employed
                                by Culaciati, and his whole approach to the question seemed to be
                                superficial and extremely “hit or miss”.</p>

                        <p>2339. Our 2302, November 18, 5 p.m. Provincial police state that Napp has
                            made one eight-page confession, which has been delivered Minister
                            Interior. Napp admitted practically everything known or suspected of him
                            but steadfastly claimed knew nothing of radio transmitters. Seriously
                            implicates Niebuhr and German Embassy. He said he had not expected
                            arrest, since arrangement had been made with police of Capital through
                            Morano, Chief of Orden Social, to secure his immunity. Was extremely
                            surprised when provincial police showed they were determined to secure
                            confession. We consider it extremely fortunate that provincial police
                            had opportunity to intervene in this matter.</p>
                        <p>Report on Napp’s confession will be sent by next courier.</p>

                        <p>2356. Embassy’s 2339, November 21, 5 p.m. Minister of the Interior
                            yesterday loaned Embassy copy of police report regarding results up to
                            November 20 of its investigations based on our third memoranda.
                            Practically nothing of value is contained in this 35 page report. As
                            examples it is mentioned that report completely “whitewashes” Thilo
                            Martens and Frederick von Schulz-Hausmann, two of the persons against
                            whom we had large amount of evidence. It appears that the report
                            completely ignored information contained in our third memorandum which
                            gave detailed confessions of two Nazi agents in Brazil who had liaison
                            locally with Martens. Report does mention that Schneider, Müller and
                            Freiwald may be to some extent involved and that they are being held for
                            additional questioning.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Schneider, Müller, Schwartz, Freiwald and Hoffmann are still under
                            arrest. Others released except Napp who was delivered to local police
                            only yesterday. Complete report by next courier.</p>
                        <p>Minister of the Interior informed me November 21 he intended publishing
                            above report either November 23 or November 24. However Napp’s
                            confession appears to have completely upset Government’s <pb n="254"
                                xml:id="pg_254" facs="0266"/>plans, since Minister, when informed by
                            member of Embassy staff yesterday that report of local police extremely
                            disappointing, agreed and stated it would be wise to postpone
                            publication few more days until Napp’s surprising confession could be
                            incorporated into the report.</p>
                        <p>It is believed Argentine Government may have had intention of a permanent
                            first report to show lack of Axis espionage activities and discredit our
                            memoranda, but that unexpected action of provincial police in obtaining
                            confession from Napp called for reorientation of policy.</p>

                        <p>2376. Our 2356, November 23, 10 p.m. Minister Interior has loaned Embassy
                            copy Napp’s confession to local police. Provincial police have given us
                            verbal résumé Napp’s confession to them.</p>
                        <p>They differ only in minor items. They will be forwarded as soon as
                            photographed and translated. Minister stated today that due Napp’s
                            practically complete confession Martin Schneider has begun to confess
                            and has implicated other agents, and that police are now searching for
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Minister also said Federal Judge would be allowed to decide method of
                            prosecuting those guilty. He stated they would be deported or interned
                            at the least.</p>
                        <p>Since Napp’s confession authorities appear to be cooperating more closely
                            with Embassy as well as taking more active interest in matter. It
                            appears we have benefitted by withholding publication of memoranda and
                            therefore influencing Argentines to act through threat of publication.
                            At least we have obtained copies of all pertinent police reports which
                            might not have been obtainable otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Press has given considerable space to Napp’s confession details of which
                            have leaked out gradually, and some papers are clamoring for Niebuhrs
                            and other German diplomat’s head.</p>

                            When subject broached to Minister Interior, he did not deny it.
                            Nationalist press has stated that mere fact Americans able uncover
                            German espionage activities is proof that Americans have even larger and
                            more dangerous organization in Argentina. While Germans can have no

                            it is possible they could fabricate plausible story which would at the

                            commercial investigating agencies in Buenos Aires. Also may be advisable
                            stress fact that stupidity of German agents themselves in working openly

                            stated 38 Axis agents had been named in accusations placed before
                            Federal Court, press releases this afternoon named only Hans Napp,
                            Ottomar Müller, Elvezio Ortelli, Martin Schneider, Walter Freiwald and
                            Lothar von Reichenbach as having been indicated in this regard. Also
                            stated that the Federal Judge had placed them under preventive custody
                            and incommunicado. In addition the press said that the findings of the
                            court seriously implicated several officials of the German Embassy and
                            that the Federal Attorney had requested that the case of these diplomats
                            be placed before the Supreme Court in accordance with the Argentine code

                            the suggestion contained in the second paragraph of your telegram under
                            reference but believes that any statement which you might have to use in
                            case the counter-memorandum allegedly being prepared by the Germans is
                            presented, should be brief and couched in most general terms and should
                            avoid any expressions or affirmations, however well founded in fact,
                            which might lead to undignified open controversy with the German Embassy

                            edification of the Argentine Foreign Office and public press.
                            Specifically the Department desires that any reference to monitoring in
                            the United States, to breakdowns of radio intercepts or to censorship

                                <p>The Government of the United States, conscious of its own

                                printed.</note> Yesterday Minister Interior returned from vacation.
                            He was in very cooperative mood and gave impression anxious continue
                            investigation espionage activities and take vigorous measures against
                            those involved. Federal Attorney Gachepiran has caused very favorable
                            impression. He is young and without professional reputation and appears
                            anxious to use this opportunity to make a name for himself.</p>
                        <p>Minister Interior said the six spies who have already confessed will
                            certainly receive prison sentences and when asked about the others named
                            in our memoranda but who had not confessed he stated categorically he
                            would expel all of those against whom there was reasonable evidence. He
                            explained that by this he meant that the evidence should be sufficient
                            only to satisfy his own conscience. He said there was no question
                            regarding the expulsion of those so highly involved as von Schulz
                            Hausmann. He stated he could not predict what action the Supreme Court
                            would take regarding the German diplomats but that in any case he would
                            recommend to Foreign Office to declare them <hi rend="italic">persona

                                    be completely cleared up, and that “several of the more guilty

                            after which these memoranda will be released to the press and radio. If
                            Chile should break off diplomatic relations with the Axis, a most
                            favorable opportunity may arise to place these alternatives squarely
                            before the Argentine Government, with an expression of the intention to
                            achieve the utmost possible publicity in case these memoranda are

                        <p>Señor García Arias stated that the Ambassador had requested him to review
                            with me the position of Argentina with respect to publication of the
                            memorandum handed the Minister of Foreign Affairs by Ambassador Armour
                            regarding the presence of Axis activities in Argentina. Señor García
                            Arias added nothing new to the statement of Argentine views. I informed
                            Señor García Arias that this Government did not present the memorandum
                            with publication the prime consideration. Our first interest was in
                            eliminating Axis activity. Although the Argentine Government had gone
                            into certain phases of the activities rather carefully, it had failed to
                            do anything whatsoever regarding other phases. Its record was definitely
                            spotty. We were prepared to give the Argentine Government a fair
                            interval to clean up the situation, just as we had the Chilean
                            Government. No indication could be given now when action might be
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>Señor García Arias expressed the hope that the Ambassador would be
                            informed before a final decision was taken.</p>

                                printed; the Ambassador indicated in this telegram the request of
                                the Supreme Court that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs obtain a
                                waiver of diplomatic immunity from Germany with respect to the Naval
                                Attaché, and also the President’s refusal to intern those arrested
                                as an infringement of the Court’s jurisdiction.</note> Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs informs me necessary documents based on Supreme Court
                            request regarding Niebuhr were handed German Chargé d’Affaires on
                            December 24. December 29 Minister called in German Chargé d’Affaires and
                            asked him to hasten his Government’s reply as to whether Niebuhr will
                            submit to courts jurisdiction since court begins its summer recess
                            December 31. German Chargé d’Affaires indicated that it might require
                            several days more. The Minister informed me that if German Government
                            consents to Niebuhr waiving immunities Supreme Court is prepared to
                            postpone its vacation to deal with case. If as seems likely German
                            Government refuses Supreme Court then fades out of picture and
                            Government will then decide next step. I said that I presumed this would
                            be to declare Niebuhr <hi rend="italic">persona non grata</hi> but
                            Minister refused to commit himself.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatches
                            No. 479 of January 12 and No. 760 of March 23, 1942,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d254fn1">Neither printed.</note> concerning the question of
                            the possible resumption of diplomatic relations between Uruguay and
                            Soviet Russia. In the first despatch, I referred to newspaper reports to
                            the effect that the Uruguayan Government was studying the possibility of
                            resuming relations with Russia and I quoted Dr. Guani<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d254fn2">Alberto Guani, Uruguayan Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> as stating that personally he thought the question
                            should be given consideration in due course and that he had so informed
                            the President. In my despatch No. 760 of March 23, I reported a
                            conversation in which Dr. Guani told me that he had been urged to take
                            steps looking to the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with
                            Russia and that he was in favor of such action but needed a suitable
                            opportunity or pretext.</p>
                        <p>Labor organizations have for some time been strongly in favor of the
                            resumption of relations with Russia and there is a growing demand for
                            action in this direction on their part and on the part of Leftist
                            groups. The movement is gathering momentum and on June 18 one of the
                            leading opposition candidates for the Presidency, Dr. Eduardo Blanco
                            Acevedo, came out in <hi rend="italic">La Razón</hi> with a statement
                            advocating resumption, expressing his admiration and sympathy for
                            Russia, and asserting that he had been opposed to the breaking off of
                            relations. <hi rend="italic">La Razón</hi> has subsequently published
                            interviews with several prominent citizens who take a similar stand.</p>
                        <p>As reported in my despatch No. 1181 of June 23,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d254fn3">Not printed.</note> there was held last evening in
                            the Ateneo of Montevideo a meeting to observe the anniversary of
                            Germany’s aggression against Russia. The gathering was organized under
                            the auspices of the “Comité Ruso pro-Patria”, made up principally of
                            White Russians. In response to an invitation <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263"
                                facs="0275"/>from the Committee, the British Minister<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d254fn4">Ralph Clarmont S. Stevenson.</note> and I had
                            agreed to attend and to make brief remarks, it being understood that no
                            attempt would be made by the organizers or the speakers to raise the
                            question of the resumption of relations, since this might put us in an
                            embarrassing position with the Uruguayan Government. At the time it was
                            not anticipated that Dr. Guani would attend the gathering. He decided to
                            attend at the last moment and obviously his presence gave the meeting
                            quite a different aspect in so far as any embarrassment to the British
                            Minister and me was concerned.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Guani received an ovation and as he took his place on the platform
                            the crowd called vociferously for the resumption of relations.
                            Subsequently, yielding to the demands of the audience, he made a very
                            brief speech in which he referred appropriately to Russia’s magnificent
                            resistance and stressed Uruguay’s consistent condemnation of aggression.
                            Speaking very deliberately, he then remarked that he knew that the
                            audience wished to hear from him on the subject of the resumption of
                            relations. He stated that, while it is true that diplomatic relations
                            are severed, his presence proved that there is no severance but rather a
                            close union of ideals between Uruguay and the Russian people, as well as
                            all other Democratic peoples. In order to bring out the full dramatic
                            effect of his words, I find it necessary to give the Spanish text, which
                            was substantially as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Si bien es cierto que hay ruptura de relaciones diplomáticas con
                                    Rusia, mi presencia aquí esta noche prueba que no hay
                                    ruptura”—</p></quote></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">at these words, the audience interpreting them as
                            meaning the resumption of relations, rose to its feet and applauded for
                            several minutes. Dr. Guani then continued— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“mi presencia aquí esta noche prueba que no hay ruptura sino
                                    unión de ideales con el pueblo ruso y todos los pueblos
                                    democráticos.”</p></quote></p>
                        <p>This morning I had occasion to see Dr. Guani and we naturally discussed
                            last evening’s meeting. He said that, while he appreciates Russia’s role
                            in the war and has every sympathy with the country in its present stand,
                            he still has some misgivings on the score of communism and some
                            apprehension as to Russia’s role after the war. He said, however, that
                            the movement in favor of resumption is gaining in strength and that the
                            question is of considerable political importance. Dr. Blanco Acevedo’s
                            advocacy of resumption he attributes to vote-catching motives. Dr. Guani
                            obviously considers resumption a distinct possibility, not to say a
                            probability, and he remarked that, when the time came for action along
                            these lines, Uruguay might request the good offices of the United States
                            or of Great Britain as an intermediary. He intimated that Great Britain
                                <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0276"/>might perhaps be rather
                            more indicated. From his remarks I did not gather that he has any
                            personal preference for Great Britain but rather that he may feel that
                            if the United States were to act as intermediary the impression might
                            arise that Uruguay’s action in resuming relations was being taken at our
                            suggestion. (Reference is made in this connection to my telegram No. 527

                            continuing and more intimate contacts between the Soviet Government and
                            the Governments of the United Nations, the former will be inclined to
                            abandon its former policies and to join with the governments of the
                            United Nations and those sympathetic thereto in all forms of desirable
                            international cooperation. I assume that the Government of Uruguay will
                            bear fully in mind the desirability before a resumption of relations is
                            agreed upon of having a clearcut and explicit understanding with the
                            Soviet Government regarding nonintervention in the domestic affairs of
                            other nations similar to that concluded with the Soviet Government by

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 1183 of June 23, 1942, concerning the movement in Uruguay in favor
                            of the resumption of relations with Russia and a conversation which I
                            had with Dr. Guani on June 23.</p>
                        <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0277"/>
                        <p>Reference is made also to my confidential telegram No. 527 of June 23 for
                            the Under Secretary and to the Under Secretary’s reply (Department’s
                            telegram No. 385 of June 25).</p>
                        <p>Yesterday, I conveyed the Under Secretary’s views verbally to Dr. Guani.
                            He expressed his appreciation.</p>
                        <p>He stated that he was of course aware of the desirability of having a
                            very definite understanding regarding non-intervention in the domestic
                            affairs of other countries; that the question was fundamental; and that
                            such an understanding with the Soviet Government must be an essential
                            condition of an eventual resumption of relations.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Guani said further that he did not intend to precipitate matters and
                            that, before taking any steps looking towards the resumption of
                            relations with Russia, he would consult with the Governments of other
                            American republics. He mentioned in particular in this connection the
                            United States, Brazil, and Chile. He intimated that he would not want
                            Uruguay to be the only South American country to résumé relations.</p>
                        <p>In the course of our conversation, Dr. Guani remarked that the principal,
                            if not the only, reason for considering the resumption of relations with
                            Russia at this time was that country’s magnificent military
                            resistance.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, his remarks yesterday were of a nature to convey the
                            impression that he might be less inclined to take early action than his
                            statements quoted in my earlier despatches would indicate. I believe
                            that the change or apparent change in his attitude is to be attributed
                            to the circumstance that he had in the meantime given the matter more
                            serious thought and was weighing his words more carefully than on former
                            occasions.</p>

                            no. 1209 of June 30, 1942, and to previous reports concerning the
                            movement in Uruguay in favor of the resumption of relations with
                            Russia.</p>
                        <p>As reported in my despatch no. 1183 of June 23, the question was brought
                            prominently to the fore in connection with the meeting, attended by Dr.
                            Guani, held in the Ateneo of Montevideo on June 22 to observe the
                            anniversary of Germany’s aggression against Russia.</p>
                        <p>Early in July, a delegation of the organization “Acción Antinazi de Ayuda
                            a los Pueblos Libres” delivered to President Baldomir several albums
                            containing petitions for the resumption of relations <pb n="266"
                                xml:id="pg_266" facs="0278"/>with Russia said to bear over twenty
                            thousand signatures. The President was quoted in <hi rend="italic">La
                                Razón</hi> as having told the delegation that resumption was a
                            measure which was “on its way” (<hi rend="italic">en marcha</hi>) and
                            that Dr. Guani’s statements at the Ateneo on June 22 (my despatch no.
                            1183) “reflected the Government’s sentiments”.</p>
                        <p>While the movement has continued, there were no further developments of
                            any particular interest until early in September when a meeting was held
                            in the Ateneo for the purpose of organizing a “Comité pro-Relaciones con
                            Rusia”. According to press reports, the committee has been set up with
                            Dr. Pedro Diaz as Chairman, Dr. Héctor Paysse Reyes as Secretary, and
                            Thomas Richardson Arrieta as Pro-Secretary. Among its members is Dr.
                            Raúl Baethgen who is chairman of the non-partisan committee which has
                            launched the presidential candidacy of Dr. Eugenio J. Lagarmilla.</p>
                        <p>The “Comité pro-Relaciones con Rusia” plans, it is reported, to issue a
                            manifesto and to conduct a vigorous campaign. Its membership includes in
                            particular persons active in the Ateneo and leaders of the Batllista and
                            Independent Blanco political groups.</p>

                        <p>The Soviet Ambassador<note n="12" xml:id="d259fn12">Maxim
                                Litvinov.</note> called to see me this afternoon at my request.</p>
                        <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0279"/>
                        <p>I told Mr. Litvinov that I had been requested by the Uruguayan
                            Government, in an entirely unofficial and personal way, to sound out the
                            Soviet Government as to whether the latter would be desirous of renewing
                            diplomatic relations with the Government of Uruguay. I said that I had
                            told the Uruguayan Government that I would be very glad to make this
                            inquiry, and requested Mr. Litvinov to let me know what the feeling of
                            his Government might be.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that, while in ordinary circumstances he was
                            already authorized to agree with representatives of the other American
                            Republics upon the establishment of diplomatic relations, he would in
                            this particular case have to inquire of his Government. He reminded me
                            of the ruptured relations between the Government of Uruguay and the
                            Soviet Union in 1935, and said that his Government felt that it had been
                            very badly treated in that instance. He went on immediately to state,
                            however, that he himself felt that incidents of this kind should not be
                            remembered and that diplomatic relations should be resumed. He expressed
                            the highest regard for Dr. Guani, the Uruguayan Foreign Minister, whom
                            he said he had seen much of in Geneva.</p>

                            Litvinov told me that he had received instructions from his Government

                            diplomatic relations with the Government of Uruguay. He suggested that
                            the Uruguayan Ambassador address a letter to him as by instruction of
                            his Government stating that the Government of Uruguay would be glad to
                            renew diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. He stated that as soon
                            as he received such a letter he would immediately send a letter in reply
                            stating that the Soviet Union would be very glad to undertake a renewal
                            of diplomatic relations with Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Litvinov that I would be very glad to transmit this
                            information immediately to the Ambassador of Uruguay and to the

                        <p>170. This Government would like to study, in collaboration with the
                            Haitian Government, the possibility of developing an overland supply
                            route to the eastern Caribbean via Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican
                            Republic to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, thus reducing shipping
                            to the short hauls connecting the islands. In view of the reduced
                            shipping available within the Caribbean area, such a route might have
                            strategic importance in the conduct of the war. As far as can be
                            foreseen at the present time, such a route would only involve the
                            improvement of existing roadways.</p>
                        <p>In informing the Foreign Minister of the foregoing would you please
                            ascertain whether his Government would be disposed to collaborate in
                            making this survey, and, if the survey indicates practicability of the
                            idea in improving the existing roadways. You may state that this
                            Government would be prepared to pay all the expenses involved in any
                            improvement work undertaken.</p>
                        <p>If the reply is in the affirmative, one or more Army engineers will
                            immediately proceed to Haiti to discuss the matter with the Haitian
                            Government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s urgent telegraphic instruction No. 170 of June 4, 11:00
                                [<hi rend="italic">8:00</hi>] p.m., 1942, directing me to enquire
                            whether the Haitian Government was disposed to cooperate in an
                            investigation to be made by American Army <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270"
                                facs="0282"/>engineers to ascertain the feasibility of an overland
                            supply route to the Eastern Caribbean.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned this project to President Lescot yesterday and, in expressing
                            his entire approval, he claimed it practically as his own, since he said
                            that for some time he had contemplated a road from the Mole via
                            Cap-Haїtien to the Dominican frontier at Ouanaminthe, whence it would go
                            presumably to Samaná Bay via Ciudad Trujillo itself. He thought there
                            would only be one short piece of new construction on this road in the
                            neighborhood of Le Borgne.</p>
                        <p>Subsequent consideration of the problems involved, however, made me think
                            that very possibly the Haitian section of the road should start at
                            Port-au-Prince. There have so far been no submarine attacks within the
                            waters of Port-au-Prince inside of the island of La Gonâve, or, for that
                            matter, between Capes Tiburon and the Mole. The approach of submarines
                            into the waters this side of La Gonâve would be fraught with great
                            additional risks, including the protective artillery now installed in
                            the neighborhood of Port-au-Prince. The additional time of this passage
                            could possibly be used during night travel.</p>
                        <p>At the Môle there are no kind of installations,—piers, warehouses, etc.
                            Everything would have to be created there.</p>
                        <p>This morning I spoke to Mr. Walker of the J. G. White Corporation to ask
                            his opinion in regard to road possibilities. He thought that the
                            completion and perfection of the northern road considered by the
                            President would take over a year. He also agreed about the comparative
                            installations at the Môle where there are none and Portau-Prince where
                            everything is ready to receive traffic. He also pointed out that there
                            is a very tolerable and used road from Portau-Prince into the Dominican
                            Republic and on the Dominican side the road is better than on the
                            Haitian side.</p>
                        <p>Asked as to the desirability of constructing a road from Port-au-Prince
                            due east via Barahona, he said that this would be only some twenty
                            kilometers shorter, but would be a saving in grades. On the other hand,
                            in view of the sandy nature of the country through which it would have
                            to pass in Western Barahona, it might be difficult to find an adequate
                            base for the road and that it would take some time to build.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Walker stated that his company did not have any detailed data in
                            regard to the costs of road building, etc., which I thought might be
                            useful to the Army engineers in case they came here.</p>

                            just informed me that his Government is deeply interested in project and
                            will gladly cooperate in making survey. The Dominican Government would
                            like to have some of its engineers accompany the American engineers who
                            make the survey and would like copies of the survey report upon
                            completion. In case the result of the survey is favorable the Dominican
                            Government would wish to be consulted beforehand regarding improvement
                            work and also at appropriate time regarding details of supply route.</p>
                        <p>In discussing this with Despradel I considered it opportune to emphasize
                            great advantages which the overland route would have for the Dominican
                            Republic especially in view of shipping shortage. I feel that the prompt
                            carrying out of this project would be extremely beneficial to our
                            relations with the Dominican Republic in view of the increasing economic
                            depression observable here and the prevailing feeling that the United
                            States has not done very much to relieve the situation.</p>

                            1942 regarding the projected overland supply route to the eastern
                            Caribbean. Precise details of this project have yet to be worked out but
                            the Army Engineers’ survey recommends the route from Port-au-Prince over
                            the existing road system through Azua and Ciudad Trujillo to San Pedro
                            de Macorís as the most desirable one. The Department, therefore, wishes
                            to obtain the approval and cooperation of the governments concerned in
                            the first and most important of the steps to be taken in this joint war
                            effort in the hope that work may commence on the highway in the near

                        <p>A good many details of the plan remain to be worked out. However, it is
                            desired that you discuss the project with President Trujillo along
                            general lines at an early opportunity pointing out that its realization
                            will not only facilitate the moving of supplies to the eastern Caribbean
                            area but will also be of great value in furnishing a supplementary route
                            for Dominican exports and possibly for imports. The Department is
                            confident, in view of the highly cooperative attitude which President
                            Trujillo has demonstrated that he will wholeheartedly assist in the
                            successful carrying out of this project. The lines along which such
                            assistance might be rendered by the Dominican Government include (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) the simplification of formalities covering the
                            storage of through shipments, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) cooperation in

                            Administration or other agency of this Government who may proceed to the
                            Dominican Republic in order to make detailed arrangements for road work.
                            You may indicate that this Government will make provision for
                            extraordinary repairs and maintenance costs resulting from truck
                            movements over Dominican roads under the project.</p>
                        <p>In discussing this matter with President Trujillo you should state that
                            the Department is not unmindful of the very serious restrictions which
                            have been placed upon the movement of automobiles and trucks in the
                            Dominican Republic due to the shortage of petroleum and petroleum
                            products. Careful consideration is being given to this situation.</p>

                            this morning President Trujillo gave assurances of his enthusiastic
                            support of the project. With respect to the particular points mentioned
                            by the Department, the President said that he would be glad at any time
                            to issue a decree establishing free ports of entry for transit goods,
                            and that he would guarantee that such goods would not be subjected to
                            any taxes or charges whatsover by the Dominican Government. The
                            President also places the entire rolling stock of the Dominican Republic
                            at our disposal for this project, and assured me that all of the other
                            resources and facilities of his Government would be available to us.</p>

                            today that he had given consideration to the draft agreement proposed by

                                “from the public domain” is inserted.</note> and that the Dominican
                            Government would be glad to enter into the agreement except that it will
                            be impossible to assume any expenses which might arise under 4 (<hi

                            Government’s financial situation was such that it would be unable to
                            provide raw materials for these projects, and that the road building
                            equipment was so limited that it would not be able to make available any
                            equipment for this work.</p>
                        <p>Despradel said that if our Government would modify the agreement with
                            respect to these two points the Dominican Government would be glad to

                        <p>A–109. Your airgram A–136, October 20. The plan for highway
                            rehabilitation and construction avoids financial outlay on the part of
                            the Dominican Treasury.</p>
                        <p>(1) Paragraph 4 (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of the draft agreement,
                            referring to raw materials such as clay, sand, gravel, stone and timber
                            involves no expenditure but merely the granting of the free use of these
                            materials which are to be found in the river beds and in the terrain
                            along the route of the highway, and likely to be a part of the public
                            domain. Any labor and transportation costs involved in handling these
                            materials would be part of the cost of the project borne by the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The Dominican Government would be expected to make such materials freely
                            available when found on the public domain and to lend its assistance in
                            making them available if found on private property. <pb n="274"
                                xml:id="pg_274" facs="0286"/>The Governments of the other American
                            Republics that have participated in cooperative highway projects have
                            been quite willing to enter into such agreements.</p>
                        <p>(2) With regard to the clause in Paragraph 4 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            regarding the use of equipment, reference is made to the Legation’s
                            despatch no. 1015 of April 9, 1942<note n="8" xml:id="d267fn8">Not
                                printed.</note> and other correspondence concerning the credit of
                            $300,000 granted by the Export-Import Bank of Washington for the
                            purchase of rolling stock and equipment for the Dominican Department of
                            Public Works. Another credit of $100,000 was created for the purchasing
                            of tractors and farm equipment for the Dominican Department of
                            Agriculture. The Department is informed that approximately $200,000 was
                            drawn by the Dominican Government on these two credits during June and
                            July, 1942. Please inform the Department of the amount of machinery and
                            equipment which has now reached the Dominican Republic or which is
                            expected to arrive in the immediate future.</p>
                        <p>You may already have noted that Paragraph 4 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) is
                            reasonably flexible as it stipulates that there should be supplied for
                            use on the project “such of the equipment owned by the Government of the
                            Dominican Republic as it may be possible to make available for this
                            work.” The contribution of the Dominican Government would be to allow
                            the use of equipment already owned by it. Part of this project is the
                            improvement and maintenance of an existing highway from San Pedro de
                            Macorís to Elías Piña. Since in any case, it is assumed that a budgetary
                            allowance is made by the Dominican Government for that work, it appears
                            that this sum could be applied to any expenses incurred under Paragraph
                            4 and that no undue dislocation of the Dominican budget would result. In
                            view of manufacturing and shipping difficulties the Public Roads
                            Administration has indicated its intention to use as little heavy
                            equipment and machinery as possible.</p>
                        <p>Will you please discuss these points with the appropriate Government
                            officials and inform the Department by airgram of the results of your
                            conversations?</p>

                        <p>480. Department’s 346, November 2, 6 p.m., and A–109 and my A–136.
                            Immediately after receipt of Department’s 346 this morning I had an
                            entirely informal conversation with the Secretary of State for the
                            Presidency. He agreed that the Dominican Government will supply all
                            procurable raw materials from the public domain and will make available
                            any public roads or Department of Agriculture equipment possible. He
                            told me that two purchases were made against the credit of $200,000
                            drawn by the Dominican Government in June and July 1942 comprising two
                            Loraine excavators. They have not arrived and there is no indication
                            when they may arrive. No other purchases of equipment for Public Works
                            or the Department of Agriculture have been completed under the two
                            credits noted in the Department’s A–109.</p>
                        <p>Following this conversation I called this morning also on the Foreign
                            Minister about the same matter. He told me his Government will sign the
                            draft subject to the following change of language in B–4<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi> “all needed raw materials locally procurable
                            from the public domain such as clay, sand, gravel, stone and

                        <p>If the Department will authorize this change in language, I shall deliver
                            him the revised draft immediately thereafter.</p>

                        <p>239. 1. Ministry Economic Warfare has asked the Embassy if it could
                            ascertain within the next few days the Department’s policy, since
                            Japan’s entry into the war, in considering firms of Japanese <pb n="283"
                                xml:id="pg_283" facs="0295"/>nationality or race for inclusion in
                            the Proclaimed List. MEW tends to consider the question of race more
                            important in the cases of Japanese than in the cases of Germans or
                            Italians. However, it recognizes the impracticability of carrying every
                            small Japanese trader in the American Republics on the Statutory List.
                            MEW seems to feel that its policy on the nationality factor may not be
                            entirely appropriate for Japanese if adhered to strictly as in the case
                            of Germans and Italians.</p>
                        <p>2. MEW proposes to accede to the request of the Netherlands Government to
                            send an observer to the Blacklist committee meetings.</p>

                        <p>236. Your 239 of January 16. Since entry into the war we have also
                            considered question of nationality more important in case of Japanese
                            than in cases of Germans and Italians proposed for Proclaimed List. Our
                            present policy is generally to list all Japanese nationals who are
                            engaged in business in American republics and who are recommended for
                            inclusion on list by our missions. In cases involving Germans and
                            Italians the Proclaimed List Committee continues to require information
                            indicating direct or indirect identification with pro-Axis activities.
                            Although many Japanese cases involve small traders we have not so far
                            had an excessively large number of cases to consider and for the present
                            the recommendations of our missions on Japanese cases are being followed
                            without any instructions from the Department with respect to selection
                            according to size of business.</p>

                        <p>The Swedish Minister, Mr. Boström, called at his request. He told me that
                            he had been instructed by his Government to protest against the
                            extension of the Proclaimed List to include Swedish firms. He <pb

                            instruction, he had reminded his Government that he had made a similar
                            oral protest last summer at the time of the President’s proclamation
                            creating the Proclaimed List and also reminded his Government that names
                            upon our Proclaimed List did not go beyond the British list and included
                            only firms which were subsidiaries of or agents for German companies. He
                            had asked for permission to make an oral protest rather than a written
                            one.</p>
                        <p>We discussed the matter briefly. The Minister said that he was sure each
                            Government understood the position of the other; that he did not wish to
                            inaugurate any controversy, but merely requested that I make a minute of
                            his call for purposes of the record. He asked that no written reply be

                                positive cooperation against Axis aggressions.</item>

                                request that specific cases not be listed we are prepared to

                                are taken by government to eliminate inimical elements from firm and

                                government or the firm. Consultation procedure is particularly

                        <p>431. In reply to inquiry of British Embassy here concerning Department’s
                            position on the listing of French firms situated outside occupied and
                            unoccupied France, we have orally advised the Embassy as follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>We are prepared to include on the Proclaimed List for European
                                    countries all cases of French firms which the British include on
                                    the Statutory List after consultation with our local mission and
                                    with you. We understand that the British policy is generally to
                                    list such firms which refuse to give undertakings not to accept
                                    direction or control from France; not to remit money to France;
                                    and not to trade with or on behalf of the enemy. We have
                                    expressed the hope that this policy would not result in the
                                    indiscriminate listing of French firms which decline to give
                                    such undertakings if the firm was not actually engaged in
                                    inimical activities. The case of Orosdi-Back in Turkey was
                                    discussed with us and while we doubted the apparent necessity
                                    for listing this firm in Turkey we stated that we would not
                                    object if MEW considered it necessary.</item>

                                <item>We advised the Embassy that we had no objection to the British
                                    continuing to request such undertakings from French firms since
                                    this was a matter for their decision but that we could not
                                    associate ourselves with such undertakings.</item>

                                <item>We informed the Embassy that we did not consider it advisable
                                    for the British to request undertakings from French firms
                                    located in this country and that we would exercise such control
                                    of these firms as seemed necessary.</item>

                            17, 1941, File No. 740.00112A European War 1939/2776A, concerning the
                            proposed extension of the proclaimed list of certain blocked nationals
                            to countries outside the other American republics and, in reply thereto,
                            to submit the following: <list>

                                    American firms; and the only firms in Eire known to be pro-Axis
                                    are either German, Belgian, Irish or of undetermined
                                    nationality.</item>

                                <item>All exports from Eire, except those to the United States or

                                    navicerts. Although vessels of Irish registry ply between ports
                                    in Eire and ports in Spain and Portugal, on their outward-bound
                                    voyages from Eire they invariably proceed to a port in South
                                    Wales where they are subjected to examination by the British
                                    authorities and take on cargoes of coal for Lisbon and
                                    Gibraltar; as a general rule they sail from Eire in ballast,
                                    although on occasion they have been known to carry luggage
                                    belonging to officials of foreign governments. Thus, it is
                                    practically impossible at the present time for any item exported
                                    from Eire to find its way to an Axis country, or be utilized for
                                    the benefit of an Axis country. Vessels of Irish registry
                                    proceeding to the United States and vessels of other registry
                                    departing from Eire are, of course, subject to British control
                                    and frequently sail under British convoy.</item>

                        <p>2. Department is requested kindly to telegraph as soon as possible
                            regarding foregoing and to instruct Embassy also as to whether
                            applications to make remittances for support of relatives in occupied
                            France are granted by Treasury (British permit such remittances).</p>
                        <p>3. British will interpret “controlled from occupied France” to mean
                            effective rather than nominal control. They have noted many French firms
                            asserting their head offices have been set up in small towns in
                            unoccupied France, whereas businesses are in reality controlled from
                            headquarters in Paris.</p>
                        <p>4. British do not intend to send the instructions arising from this
                            coordination of policy to their missions in American Republics until
                            they have consulted British Embassy, Washington.</p>

                            List.</p>
                        <p>Although no general effort has been made up to the present time to
                            include in the List Axis organizations which were not engaged in <pb

                            isolated cases non-commercial Axis organizations have been included and
                            the successful results attending such inclusion indicate the
                            desirability of a wider consideration of such organizations with respect
                            to possible inclusion.</p>
                        <p>You are, therefore, requested to forward reports concerning Axis-inspired
                            political organizations, Chambers of Commerce, schools, or other
                            non-commercial groups with recommendations concerning the desirability
                            of their inclusion in the Proclaimed List. In connection with such

                            results through the stigma that will be attached to the organizations in
                            the minds of the local public, through the possible inclusion of such
                            names in local black lists, through the probable desire to resign on the
                            part of persons who are not strongly pro-Axis in their sympathies but
                            who may have joined for business or social reasons, and through the

                        <p>A–15. Reference your telegram 4191 of July 27.</p>
                        <p>1. We have no objection to the taking of undertakings from firms
                            “controlled” from occupied France provided that the undertaking is based
                            on the complete and effective severance of such control. In those
                            circumstances we would no longer consider the firm controlled from
                            occupied France for listing purposes.</p>
                        <p>2. We do not contemplate seeking such undertakings generally ourselves
                            but we would not ordinarily list a firm from which the British had
                            accepted an undertaking. Although we cannot associate ourselves with
                            their undertakings from French firms we believe it is advisable that our
                            missions be kept informed by the British of all cases where they
                            contemplate accepting undertakings in order that divergent actions may
                            not be taken. In all important cases we believe it would also be
                            desirable for MEW or ourselves to be informed beforehand so that any
                            adverse information available in London or Washington could be
                            considered before undertaking is accepted.</p>
                        <p>3. Our general views on these undertakings are that an undertaking should
                            only be considered where the mission is satisfied that the firm is
                            genuinely anti-Axis in political sympathy and that caution <pb n="294"
                                xml:id="pg_294" facs="0306"/>should be exercised not to give undue
                            weight to a technical severance of control from French territory as
                            there is evidence that many French firms have taken steps to grant
                            powers of attorney with respect to the operation of their branches, and
                            it is felt that this procedure leads to the possibility of a technical
                            compliance with the requirements of a severance of control without any
                            real change in the influence over the firm’s operations.</p>
                        <p>Any arrangement between a head office in France and a branch in a neutral
                            country whereby control is shifted from the head office to the branch
                            should be scrutinized with particular care where the head office is in
                            occupied France.</p>
                        <p>4. It is the policy of the Treasury not to license any remittances to
                            enemy or enemy-occupied territory. This includes occupied France.
                            Subsistence remittances to American citizens in occupied territories are
                            handled by State Department through the Swiss Government.</p>

                            war. Purpose would be now to secure greater fear of listing on the part
                            of neutral firms who, largely invulnerable to United Nations’ sanctions
                            at present, are not hesitant about indulging in lucrative trade with the
                            enemy as they feel that war trade lists will be abolished at the end of
                            the war and they will be able to résumé trade with United Nations on the
                            same basis as firms which have scrupulously foregone enemy business.
                            Proponents of retention recognize that in the American Republics it
                            might be less desirable than elsewhere, but think that an announcement
                            that the lists “will not be abolished” (not necessarily that “the lists
                            will be continued”) upon the termination of the war, would be most
                            desirable as an extremely effective way of removing the contempt in
                            which the lists are now held by many business men in neutral countries,

                        <p>A–138. Your 4991, September 5, 1942, concerning MEW proposal that some
                            announcement be made that the War Trade Lists will remain in effect for
                            some time after termination of the war. The following represent our
                            tentative views on this matter.</p>
                        <p>We believe that any formal announcement by the British Government or this
                            Government along these lines would receive primary attention both in
                            neutral and belligerent countries as representing one of the first
                            concrete statements of post-war policies on the part of our governments.
                            It would probably be given more importance and broader interpretation
                            than would be warranted and in this connection we believe such an
                            announcement would inevitably result in charges that the continuation of
                            our War Trade Lists after the war would involve punitive measures
                            against neutrals and that such a policy would be contrary to and make
                            impossible the establishment of normal and non-discriminatory
                            international commercial relations between peaceful nations. The
                            announcement of such a policy might be distorted to represent policies
                            more in accord with the “new order” of the Axis than the type of
                            post-war settlement for which the United Nations are fighting. Moreover,
                            an announcement now that we proposed to continue the war trade lists
                            after the war would be accepted by persons who are critical of the lists
                            as confirming the charge that the lists are motivated by national trade
                            rivalries and selfish commercial considerations rather than the
                            exigencies of war and national defense. We fear that such charges might
                            discredit seriously the post-war policies of the United Nations and in
                            particular the present economic warfare justification for the War Trade
                            Lists in the eyes of the countries affected and in the eyes of the
                            business community generally. Against these manifest and serious
                            objections to such an announcement at present we find it difficult to
                            see clearly the compensating advantages which would be realized. We
                            believe it is very important in this connection to distinguish sharply
                            between the question of whether it will be necessary to retain the War
                            Trade Lists in operation for a period following the termination of the
                            war and the question of whether it is advisable presently to announce
                            such a policy. <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0308"/>We can imagine
                            that it may well be necessary to retain the lists for a period after the
                            war, but we believe it is impossible at present to foresee with any
                            accuracy what will be the nature of the conditions which might make such
                            a policy necessary. It is quite probable that the immediate post-war
                            conditions would be such that any such policy would have to take into
                            account the situation in particular countries. On the other hand, we
                            cannot at present imagine any useful purpose which would be served by an
                            announcement which suggested that a distinction would be drawn between
                            different countries. In fact, there would be obvious dangers in any such
                            suggestion. Since the principal, if not the only, advantage for making
                            such an announcement of policy now would be the deterrent effect which
                            it would have on otherwise invulnerable firms it would be necessary, in
                            our opinion, to make the announcement absolutely applicable to specified
                            countries or to all countries if its deterrent purpose was to be
                            realized.</p>
                        <p>If we are correct in believing that the principal or sole purpose of such
                            an announcement would be its deterrent effect in assisting the current
                            enforcement of the War Trade Lists policy we can see very little, if
                            any, need for invoking such an additional sanction with respect to the
                            American Republics since nearly all firms in these countries which are
                            dependent upon international trade are today either subject to the
                            effective threat of inclusion on the War Trade Lists, or are subject to
                            local internal controls which restrict or prevent pro-Axis activities on
                            their part. Accordingly, today we can see no advantage which could
                            outweigh the obvious disadvantages of announcing such a policy with
                            respect to the American Republics. Although we are not in a position at
                            present to say that there would not be important deterrent advantages in
                            announcing such a policy for certain European countries, we are very
                            doubtful, as stated above, that it would be advisable politically or
                            otherwise to single out the European neutrals in any such
                            announcement.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing represent our preliminary views on this matter and we
                            believe it would be advisable for you to bring these considerations
                            promptly to the attention of responsible officials in the British
                            Government in order that a hasty and ill-advised position may not be
                            taken on this extremely important matter. In this connection you may
                            state that we would now be opposed to making any such announcement with
                            respect to the American Republics and that we would not be prepared to
                            associate ourselves with such an announcement with respect to the
                            European countries without much more careful consideration and a clearer
                            appreciation of the advantages from and necessity for such a move. We,
                            of course, recognize that future developments might be such as to
                            require an entirely different view of this matter.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the objective which MEW has in mind might be
                            substantially achieved in particular cases in Europe if informally and
                                <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0309"/>unofficially the local
                            Black List authorities found appropriate occasions for replying to
                            inquiries on this subject to the effect that it was not impossible that
                            our Governments would find it necessary to maintain their War Trade List
                            policies with respect to certain persons and firms who had proven
                            unfriendly to our war interests. We should want to give further
                            consideration to even this possibility before anything were done along
                            these lines by our representatives.</p>

                        <p>6128. Reference to the Department’s telegram No. A–138, October 10,
                            respecting continuance of war trade lists after the war. The
                            Department’s comment on the British proposal has been presented to
                            Ministry of Economic Warfare and exhaustively discussed with its
                            officials. The cogency of the Department’s views is realized and we are
                            assured that no hasty action will be taken here or indeed any
                            announcement made of this character without American concurrence. The
                            Ministry of Economic Warfare, however, attaches such importance to this
                            proposal that it requests a renewed examination of the problem in the
                            light of the following observations: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The proposed policy would not be directed against any neutral
                                    country in particular but against listed firms and individuals
                                    in neutral countries who continue to trade with or otherwise
                                    assist the enemy. In executing this policy consideration can
                                    continue to be given to the economic interests of neutral
                                    countries. Consequently it is believed that we could combat any
                                    contention that this policy would represent punitive or
                                    discriminatory measures against neutral countries as such
                                    inasmuch as any announcement would refer solely to listed firms
                                    or persons.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>Compensating advantages of such an announcement particularly
                                    with respect to European neutrals are in London believed to
                                    outweigh the disadvantages cited in Department’s A–138. We
                                    discussed at some length with Ministry of Economic Warfare the
                                    alternative suggestion set forth in the final paragraph of this
                                    airgram but the opinion here is that such a method would not be
                                    an effective deterrent. Furthermore, the British contend that
                                    present developments are such as to warrant action of the nature
                                    proposed. They are strongly of the opinion that the moment has
                                    come to sharpen this weapon of economic warfare and that the
                                    proposed action would <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0310"
                                    />have a salutary effect in Switzerland, Sweden and Portugal.
                                    The British missions in Bern and Lisbon are strongly in favor of
                                    a public announcement and have stressed that the same effect
                                    could not be achieved by informal or unofficial warnings. In
                                    Switzerland the Ministry of Economic Warfare believes that the
                                    listing policy is at the moment effective in reducing the
                                    exportation of fuses to Germany and has indications that the
                                    Germans in their effort to obtain as large as possible quantity
                                    of fuses from Switzerland have agreed to permit certain
                                    additional Swiss exports to us if a relaxation of the listing
                                    policy against firms working on Axis orders can be obtained. It
                                    has furthermore been brought out in the current negotiations
                                    with the Swiss<note n="22" xml:id="d291fn22">See <ref

                                    anxious to avoid listing even when not particularly vulnerable.
                                    Consequently an increased effectiveness of the threat of listing
                                    in the next few moments [<hi rend="italic">months</hi>] is
                                    considered to be of great value.</item>

                                <item>In respect of Latin America the British argue that as the
                                    proposal is directed principally against firms and individuals

                                    announcement would not, therefore, be confined to any country or
                                    group of countries. It is immaterial to the Ministry what
                                    publicity would be given in that region and it would agree to
                                    confine local publicity to European neutrals. It is believed
                                    here, however, that it would not be possible to make public this
                                    distinction in any official announcement.</item>

                                    under date of October 16 a proposed statement on this matter
                                    which has doubtless been communicated to the Department. The
                                    Ministry emphasizes that it is not wedded to this particular
                                    phraseology and it would welcome any suggestions on our part.
                                    For example, it was suggested that the statement might be
                                    amplified by the addition of a phrase making it clear that we
                                    are merely reserving the right to take such action. We would
                                    thereby not be committed to enforcing it fully.</item>

                                    President of Portugal, and to Gen. Francisco Franco y Bahamonde,

                            Furthermore, in line with the considerations already stated by us, we
                            believe any such announcement would be utilized by the Axis propaganda
                            agencies not only to discredit our post-war aims, but also to create in
                            the minds of their peoples both at home and abroad the impression that
                            they, the people, had no alternative but to fight and resist us to the
                            bitter end. This would be, we believe, contrary to the current
                            propaganda policies of our two governments and not in our best interests
                            at the present juncture. In this connection please emphasize with MEW
                            that the announcement of a post-war policy now regarding continuation of
                            the War Trade Lists with respect to Axis firms abroad inevitably
                            involves implications that Axis firms within the Axis countries will
                            also be subjected to retaliatory international trade restrictions.
                            Manifestly, we cannot risk backing into even an implied suggestion of
                            post-war policies on such a basic question through a statement of policy
                            on the War Trade Lists.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the foregoing basic considerations and the points made in
                            our previous airgram, we find it difficult to reconcile such a proposed
                            announcement with the current European listing policies which are not
                            themselves as rigorous as they could be made.</p>
                        <p>If a listed firm is vulnerable to our controls, no further deterrent
                            pressure is needed against it unless we ourselves are dealing with <pb
                                n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0312"/>the firm for supply or
                            pre-emptive reasons or have been compelled to permit our firms to deal
                            with it for similar reasons. If a firm would be vulnerable to our
                            controls but is not presently listed, the answer would seem to be to
                            list it. Such a firm would certainly not be deterred greatly by the
                            announcement of such a policy if it had reason to believe, as it has had
                            up to now, that the list would not be applied to it. In this connection
                            we are aware that there are many circumstances, including the purchasing
                            and pre-emptive buying programs and political problems, which make a
                            more rigorous listing and licensing policy difficult. If a firm is not
                            presently vulnerable because not dependent upon international commerce,
                            we see no reason to believe it would be greatly deterred by a loose
                            threat of continuing a control against it which, even under war
                            conditions, was admittedly ineffective. Under post-war circumstances the
                            control would probably be even less effective.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the observation in your no. 6128 of November 2, paragraph
                            no. 2, that an increased effectiveness of the threat of listing would be
                            of great value in Switzerland during the next few months, we believe
                            that this purpose can best be achieved by both applying our listing and
                            licensing policies more vigorously in Switzerland and perhaps by letting
                            it be known locally, either informally or by public announcement, that
                            this was being done. We consider such steps, wherever necessary and
                            advisable, much more likely to be effective and less dangerous than any
                            present public announcement with respect to a general post-war policy
                            concerning the War Trade Lists.</p>
                        <p>The Canadian Legation here has informed us that the Canadian Government
                            is not presently sympathetic to the MEW proposed announcement.</p>
                        <p>Please keep us fully informed on this matter.</p>

                        <p>6043. British Embassy here has advised Department that Netherlands
                            Government proposes to publish a blacklist of its own in the near future
                            and that the Netherland authorities may shortly suggest their being
                            represented on Proclaimed List Committee. Department has had no word of
                            these developments from other sources and requests any information on it
                            available to you. Tentatively we can see no need for the publication of
                            another list and we believe it would <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301"
                                facs="0313"/>be impossible, for various reasons, to extend further
                            representation on the Proclaimed List Committee.</p>
                        <p>Please telegraph your and MEW’s views and whether British authorities

                        <p>6854. 1. Embassy has been informed orally, with reference to Department’s
                            6043, November 30, by Netherlands Ministry of Justice as follows: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Under a Dutch decree of October 22, 1942, a Black List
                                    Committee and Black List will be established. Black List
                                    Committee will meet under chairmanship of official of Ministry
                                    of Justice and will have representatives of Foreign Office,
                                    Ministry of Colonies, Ministry of Trade, Industry and Shipping.
                                    The Committee will meet in London and will make recommendations
                                    to the Minister of Justice who will promulgate list. Although
                                    there have been no meetings of Committee as yet it is believed
                                    that it will convene before Christmas and that first Dutch Black
                                    List will be published at approximately the same time as
                                    revision to Statutory List in January.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Prohibition of intercourse with any persons appearing on Dutch
                                    list will be binding on all Dutch subjects and Dutch nationals
                                    residing in United Nations or neutral territory. The Dutch
                                    intend to follow statutory listings in Eastern Hemisphere and
                                    Proclaimed listings in Western Hemisphere. Dutch officials
                                    believe that creation of their list will stop previously
                                    existing breach in blockade for there is at present no sanction
                                    against Dutch nationals trading with persons on Proclaimed and
                                    Statutory Lists other than threat of listing.</item>

                                <item>Netherlands Ministry of Justice believes that no concurrence
                                    other than that described in paragraph 2 will be necessitated by
                                    establishment of Dutch list. In Eastern Hemisphere Dutch Consuls
                                    who make independent investigations will report to the
                                    Netherlands Minister and he in turn will unofficially consult
                                    his British colleague. It is the Dutch desire that a somewhat
                                    similar procedure be followed in Western Hemisphere. However,
                                    Dutch feel that they would like to have the opportunity of
                                    listing Dutch nationals or firms with large Dutch interests in
                                    their own list previous to their publication either in the
                                    Statutory or Proclaimed List. Further, they believe that if they
                                    are to follow the Proclaimed List they would be somewhat loath
                                    to do so if they were given no voice whatsoever in the
                                    listings.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>2. The Dutch attend the Black List Committee here as observers. A formal
                            request was made by them for access to Ministry of Economic <pb n="302"
                                xml:id="pg_302" facs="0314"/>Warfare’s records. In acquiescing in
                            this Ministry of Economic Warfare invited them to attend the Black List
                            Committee and observe its work. Although Ministry of Economic Warfare
                            maintains and [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] that they are only observers
                            a Dutch representative attends every meeting of the Black List
                            Committee. Experience of Ministry officials and American member is that
                            this Dutch representative does not intervene in cases other than those
                            in which there is a Dutch interest.</p>
                        <p>3. No other United Nations Governments have requested representatives on
                            Black List Committee. Black List Section Ministry of Economic Warfare
                            believes that case of Dutch can be distinguished from others because of
                            control of territory and large overseas interests. Belgian Congo, only
                            other large United Nations territory under administration of government
                            in exile, is adequately controlled by other than Black List means.</p>
                        <p>4. Dutch state that they have received invitation to attend Lisbon Status
                            Committee. Neither Ministry of Economic Warfare nor this Embassy have
                            any information in this regard.</p>
                        <p>5. Ministry of Economic Warfare states that far from dissuading Dutch
                            from the establishment of Black List of their own they pressed them to
                            institute one previous to invasion of Dutch East Indies by Japanese. The
                            officials of Ministry believe that as Dutch territory is reoccupied the
                            value of the Dutch Black List may increase. In fact they believe that
                            such a list may well have another advantage in that it may open up
                            additional sources of intelligence. This was emphasized in regard to
                            Sweden where they state the Dutch representative is good intelligence
                            officer. They also believe that existence of a Dutch list would not
                            detract from Proclaimed and Statutory Lists but might even give them
                            added strength. It is added by them that Black List Section of Ministry
                            consults with United Nations Governments when question of listing Allied
                            nationals or firms with large Allied interests arises. This procedure
                            would have to be followed regarding Dutch interests even if the
                            Netherlands Government did not have an observer on the Black List
                            Committee.</p>
                        <p>6. Embassy hear Netherlands Government concurs in our view that in the
                            circumstances it would not be practicable to cause Dutch withdrawal and
                            suggests that unless there is a compelling reason it would be
                            psychologically undesirable to attempt to dissuade them from
                            establishing list.</p>

                        <p>Reference Department’s previous instructions regarding status of French
                            firms for Proclaimed List purposes. The Department believes that the
                            recent military and political developments in both continental France
                            and the French African territories have now produced a situation which
                            permits and requires a definite determination of the status of all
                            French enterprises in the American republics with respect to our
                            Proclaimed List and related policies. Accordingly you are requested to
                            review the status of all French enterprises which have been under
                            observation and to report promptly any such persons or firms who
                            maintain any commercial or financial relations with continental France,
                            or who currently are “collaborationist” or “pro-Axis” in political
                            sympathies, or who maintain any corporate or other business connections
                            with enterprises in continental France. We are now prepared to place any
                            such persons or firms on the Proclaimed List and recommendations for
                            such action should be forwarded to the Department promptly.</p>
                        <p>In this connection it is suggested you consult your British colleague
                            with particular regard to reviewing the status of any French enterprises
                            which may be presently classified as “starred black list” cases on the
                            MEW War Trade Lists.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s circular instruction of October 9, 1942<note n="24"
                                xml:id="d295fn24">Not printed.</note> regarding use of undertakings
                            in connection with French firms remains in effect except that all
                            continental France is now to be treated as occupied France was
                            previously treated for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>In particular a prompt reply is requested with respect to the status of
                            any Havas Telemundial or Teleradio agency operations in your country.
                            Havas Teleradio has been denied Treasury licenses for funds for further
                            operations in the United States and its operations have ceased here. If
                            the Havas agency is continuing to operate in your country a
                            recommendation for its inclusion in the Proclaimed List should be
                            forwarded to the Department. For your confidential information the
                            Office of War Information here is endeavoring to establish or contact a
                            French news service to Algiers and this service for special purposes may
                            use the name Havas but will in fact have no connection with the old
                            Havas agencies except that they may use certain of the former Havas
                            personnel in New York.</p>

                        <p>A–290. Reference BEW 326 dated September 10, 1942 from Bern and
                            Department’s A 259 of December 3 and Bern’s telegram no. 4574 dated
                            October 8<note n="25" xml:id="d296fn25">None printed.</note> on
                            Confidential List. The Department believes that it is probably not
                            possible or desirable to fix as exact rules and criteria for listing
                            firms in neutral countries of Europe as are applied with respect to
                            firms in South America. In general, the purpose of the Proclaimed and
                            Statutory Lists is to bring to bear all of the sanctions available to
                            the British and this government against firms and individuals whose
                            operations, activities or known sympathies are favorable to the Axis
                            cause. Such sanctions should be regarded as including the stoppage of
                            transactions between such firms and persons subject to the control of
                            the British and American Governments, the blocking of funds of such
                            firms in the United States, Great Britain or Canada, and such effect as
                            the stigmatizing of the firm may have on local transactions and on
                            transactions with other neutral countries in Europe and South
                            America.</p>
                        <p>In general, firms which should be considered for inclusion are: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Those that are controlled by persons in Axis territory or by
                                    Axis nationals known to be sympathetic to the Axis cause.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Firms maintaining trade with enemy territory or substantially
                                    connected by trade or otherwise with firms on the published
                                    lists.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Firms whose activities in any way aid the Axis.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Considerations against the strict application of these general rules
                            would be: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>If the firm had available for export to the United States
                                    strategic materials.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>If the number of firms to be included under the criteria
                                    mentioned was so large as to weaken the effectiveness of the
                                    list. This consideration should be balanced against the results
                                    to be obtained from listing and the mere size of the list would
                                    not constitute an objection if any salutary results were to be
                                    expected as a result of the listing.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Political considerations, including the essentiality of the
                                    operations of the firm in the local economy.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In general, in the absence of considerations with respect to strategic
                            materials the fact that a firm has been an agent for or has engaged in
                            trade with the United States or Great Britain should not affect its
                            inclusion in the published lists. In rare cases where the Consul
                            believes <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0317"/>that considerations of
                            this nature should be taken into account, the case should be reported in
                            full to the Embassy at London and to the Department with a statement of
                            the reasons why the reporting office believes that special
                            considerations are applicable.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the question raised in your despatch no. 5311 dated
                            September 3, 1942<note n="26" xml:id="d296fn26">Not printed.</note>
                            enclosing communications relating to the application of listing policies
                            to firms in Sweden, the Department believes that the absence of
                            vulnerability may be taken into account in connection with other factors
                            such as the unimportance of the firm and the unduly large number of
                            firms in a given country which might otherwise be eligible for listing.
                            In the absence of such other factors, however, the Department believes
                            that the absence of vulnerability to American or British controls should
                            not usually be a controlling factor as the stigmatizing of a firm which
                            is controlled from enemy territory or which is pro-Nazi in its
                            activities is of itself useful in most cases and may result in indirect
                            sanctions through the unwillingness of other firms in the same country
                            or other countries to transact business with it following its
                            listing.</p>

                            surpluses of a long list of Argentine commodities. Of these, the most
                            interesting from the point of view of Argentina is unquestionably
                            linseed. The negotiations up to the present with regard to linseed have
                            been held up because of the failure to agree on price. Today the Federal
                            Loan Agency has agreed, contingent on the satisfactory conclusion of the
                            entire agreement as to the rest of the commodities, to underwrite the
                            purchase of 30,000,000 bushels of linseed, partly from the old and
                            partly from the new crop, at $1.10 per bushel, f.o.b. Buenos Aires. This
                            price we are informed by the representative of the Loan Agency<note

                            basis which should enable the immediate conclusion of the over-all
                            purchase agreement. I am leaving Washington Saturday and should arrive
                            at Rio January 20. I shall explain all details to Sumner Welles.

                        <p>192. From the Under Secretary. The Argentine Ambassador<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d299fn7">Felipe A. Espil.</note> called to see me yesterday
                            evening. He told me that he had received several telegrams from his
                            Government since my return to Washington urging that he obtain a
                            statement from me of the general views and policies of this Government
                            with regard to Argentina since the conclusion of the conference at Rio
                            de Janeiro.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador, who is laboring under very considerable personal
                            resentment because of the increasingly severe trend of press comment in
                            the United States with regard to Argentina’s present policies and
                            attitude, said that he feared that the United States was embarking upon
                            a policy of pressure upon Argentina and a policy of reprisal because of
                            the refusal of Argentina to follow the course taken by 19 other American
                            republics.</p>
                        <p>I stated to the Ambassador that he could inform his Government that the
                            United States was following neither a policy of pressure nor a policy of
                            reprisal. I said that I was surprised, in view of the relations which
                            had existed between Argentina and the United States during the past 9
                            years and the well-known and proven policy of the Government of the
                            United States, that such a question could even be raised.</p>
                        <p>I stated that this Government was pursuing a policy which was completely
                            realistic. I said that at the present time demands were being made upon
                            the United States by all of the united nations in all parts of the world
                            for urgently-needed naval and military material. I continued that
                            adequate defense of the Western Hemisphere was a matter of cardinal
                            concern to this Government. During the past few weeks, moreover, six
                            American republics, in addition to those which had already taken action,
                            had broken relations with <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0320"/>the
                            Axis powers and had openly sided with the United States. These nations
                            had consequently incurred the dangers inherent in the position which
                            they had assumed. For that reason, I said, it was imperative for this
                            Government to give immediate and prompt consideration to their defense
                            requirements. By reason of the fact that Argentina had not adopted a
                            similar attitude, it should be obvious that the requirements of these
                            other nations were more urgent than those of Argentina and would
                            consequently be given preferential attention by the United States. I
                            concluded by saying that this position would be made clear to the
                            military and naval representatives of Argentina now in Washington by the
                            War and Navy Departments as well as by the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>In your conversations with the Acting Foreign Minister you may inform him
                            accordingly.</p>
                        <p>For your personal information, the policies which you and I discussed,
                            and which have been recently referred to in telegrams exchanged between
                            you and the Department, will be followed in detail. As a result of a
                            meeting I had this morning with appropriate officials here in the
                            Department, certain studies will be promptly undertaken of the actual
                            need by the United States of so-called strategic materials in Argentina
                            in order to determine whether the pending contract for the purchase by
                            us of strategic materials in Argentina should be consummated in whole or
                            in part. I feel very strongly that the announcement of a contract of
                            this kind would be politically inexpedient owing to present conditions
                            in Argentina and in the neighboring countries. It seems to me that this
                            Government can purchase in the open market in Argentina the quantities
                            it requires of hides, wool, and linseed and that there is no need to
                            enter into the contract which has been under discussion. I would
                            appreciate having your own views with regard to this question.
                            [Welles.]</p>

                        <p>271. For the Under Secretary. Your telegram 192, February 10, 9 p.m.,
                            reference last paragraph. I agree with you that our Government should be
                            able to purchase in the open market quantities it requires of products
                            mentioned and that there is no need to enter into a contract at this
                            time. However, I should like to discuss this matter with Williams who
                            has been handling negotiations on his return to Buenos Aires next
                            week.</p>
                        <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0321"/>
                        <p>I have heard reports that Government here is contemplating securing
                            control of products mentioned with a view to forcing our hand but in the
                            absence of more definite information I am inclined to think they would
                            only proceed to such length as a last resort.</p>

                        <p>403. For the Under Secretary. My 271, February 13, 10 p.m., was explained
                            to Williams on his return and he is in entire agreement.</p>
                        <p>On February 25, Williams called on Alonso Irigoyen<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d301fn8">Argentine Under Secretary of Finance.</note> and
                            informed him that due to the changed international situation it would be
                            necessary to reconsider proposals included in the over-all purchase
                            program and therefore negotiations would be suspended for the present.
                            Irigoyen was greatly disturbed and urged that the agreement be concluded
                            without delay stating that whatever might be said to the contrary every
                            one would consider suspension as reprisal for not following our
                            Government’s international policy. Williams explained that shortage of
                            shipping, the possibility of having to take delivery of commodities here
                            and to advance substantial sums, combined with possible local storage
                            difficulties, were well founded reasons for reconsideration of the
                            program. He emphasized that such reconsideration was in no sense a
                            reprisal: that such action was necessitated by a situation now existing
                            which did not exist when the original offer was made; and furthermore
                            that the commitment to supply essential materials would now be more
                            difficult to fulfill because of increased demands for our own and our
                            Allies’ requirements. He also pointed out that export control was less
                            important now than previously.</p>
                        <p>Williams also spoke to Coll Benegas<note n="9" xml:id="d301fn9"
                                >Presumably Carlos A. Coll Benegas, Argentine economic
                                consultant.</note> along similar lines. Latter also was disturbed
                            and appeared pessimistic regarding the Argentine economic outlook. He
                            considered it unfair that the negotiations be suspended claiming that
                            the possible motives mentioned had previously been contemplated.</p>
                        <p>On February 27, Williams made similar statement to Torriani<note n="10"
                                xml:id="d301fn10">Carlos L. Torriani, Director of the Division of
                                Economic and Consular Affairs of the Argentine Foreign
                                Office.</note> and also discussed export control clause since
                            Torriani was previously opposed to our wording. Torriani while stating
                            that he felt an <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0322"/>acceptable
                            formula could be agreed upon still maintained previous viewpoint. A
                            detailed report will be airmailed.</p>
                        <p>Williams requests Federal Loan Agency to advise what commodities they
                            desire to purchase independently. Beryllium oxide contract will be
                            signed March 3. It contains clause making effect dependent on conclusion
                            of over-all agreement. If over-all purchase negotiations should be
                            suspended indefinitely, would Metals Reserve Company be disposed to
                            ratify beryllium contract independently of overall agreement?</p>
                        <p>Without any indications that negotiations of over-all agreement are being
                            resumed, it may be found advisable to effect separate agreements for the
                            purchase of certain other specific products, such as linseed, as better
                            terms probably would be offered than obtained in open market. For
                            example it is probable that a separate agreement could be concluded for
                            linseed purchases on the same basis as proposed in over-all
                            agreement.</p>

                        <p>509. William Baum Company of New York has asked Department for an
                            expression of opinion concerning proposed sale of 360,000 tons of
                            Argentine scrap to Bethlehem Steel in exchange for 60,000 tons of
                            manufactured steel. Baum states that Crespo<note n="12"

                            inform Baum that maximum available <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311"

                            quarterly allocations. Whether or not Crespo is in a position to arrange
                            export of scrap, the fact that this offer has been made is an indication
                            that there are probably substantial quantities of scrap in Argentina
                            which cannot be used there.</p>

                                n="17" xml:id="d306fn17">Col. Manuel N. Savio.</note> as requested
                            in Department’s 509, April 13, 5 p.m. While Colonel Savio was very
                            sympathetic regarding United States’ needs for scrap, he reiterated his
                            previous position to the effect that most complete data they have been
                            able to obtain indicates that not more than 400,000 tons of scrap can be
                            said to be in any way readily available in Argentina and that no
                            quantity of this has been collected in any one place. He stated that the
                            most liberal estimate, including much that is practically inaccessible
                            or unobtainable for other reasons, would not increase the total beyond
                            700,000 tons. He feels that Argentina must increase its own iron and
                            steel production as a matter of defense and <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313"
                                facs="0325"/>that therefore, it must conserve what scrap is
                            available for that purpose. He further stated that scrap is now being
                            sold at speculative prices, as high as 52 pesos, approximately $12.30
                            per metric ton, placed Buenos Aires, and that any prospect of export
                            would so increase the speculative price as to make it practically
                            prohibitive. He indicated no interest in a matter of exchange of scrap
                            for finished steel.…</p>
                        <p>While this discussion was entirely informal, it is the Embassy’s belief
                            that Colonel Savio’s position represents the official viewpoint and that
                            it would be useless to present the matter formally through the Foreign
                            Office unless the Department feels otherwise.</p>

                                    oxide to the conclusion of the over-all purchase agreement be

                        <p>In Embassy’s opinion beryl ore export permits will not be granted until

                            suggested that authorization be granted to make Saba contract effective
                            with paragraph 4 of special conditions eliminated and a clause
                            substituted making the effectiveness of contract contingent upon the
                            Argentine Government granting export licenses for export to the United
                            States for an accumulated 568 tons beryl ore and agreeing to <pb n="314"

                            100 tons per month with a minimum total of 1200 metric tons per year.
                            Agreement would probably be along lines outlined in last paragraph of

                        <p>656. From Metals Reserve. Your 825, May 5, 11 p.m.</p>
                        <p>“Metals Reserve is prepared to make the Saba contract effective
                            contingent upon the Argentine Government granting export licenses for
                            export to the United States of the accumulated stocks of beryl ore and a
                            further agreement to grant licenses at the rate of a minimum of 100 tons
                            of ore monthly out of current production. Since the consumption of the
                            Saba plant will be only about 1,000 tons of ore per year, export
                            licenses should be granted for any quantity in excess of this
                            requirement of Saba but not less than 1,200 tons annually.”</p>

                            Government was explained regarding rubber contracts in other Latin
                            American countries, as well as the policy to be followed in making
                            available to the other American republics their essential needs of
                            rubber and rubber products.</p>
                        <p>The substance of this telegram, as instructed, was communicated to the
                            Argentine Government by Embassy note No. 750, dated May 21, 1942. By
                            note signed by the Minister of Foreign Relations and Worship, dated June
                            18, 1942, but which was not despatched from the Ministry until June 25,
                            1942, the Argentine Government acknowledges receipt of the Embassy’s
                            note No. 750 and advises that the Argentine Government is anxious to
                            immediately initiate conversations with this Embassy for the purpose of
                            arriving at a “modus vivendi” with respect to the future supply of crude
                            rubber for Argentina. For that purpose they have designated Dr. Raúl E.
                            Arrarás Vergara delegate of the Ministry of Agriculture on the Rubber
                            Distribution Committee (see voluntary report No. 940 of March 31,
                                1942<note n="22" xml:id="d310fn22">Not printed.</note>) as the
                            person who is authorized to treat with the Embassy on the subject of
                            crude rubber. The announced purpose is to reach an agreement,
                            satisfactory to the essential needs of the Argentine for rubber during
                            the present emergency, including those which contribute to the provision
                            of foodstuffs and supplies to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Informally the Embassy has, on several occasions, discussed rubber in
                            general with Dr. Vergara and other members of the Rubber Distribution
                            Committee. This information has been supplied the Department by
                            despatches Nos. 4339 of March 6, 1942 and 4935 of May 4, 1942.<note
                                n="23" xml:id="d310fn23">Neither printed.</note> Dr. Vergara has
                            consistently intimated that the United <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316"
                                facs="0328"/>States should advise Argentina of the amount of rubber
                            that it can guarantee for this market. The Embassy’s position, lacking
                            further instructions, has been that until Argentina is willing to
                            present a complete picture, including rubber stocks, consumption by
                            articles produced, restrictions now in effect, and those definitely
                            provided for the future, with the dates on which they will be made
                            effective, that there would be little use in our proposal to our
                            Government in Washington that a fixed amount of rubber be set aside. The
                            Embassy has frankly expressed to Dr. Vergara and others of the Rubber
                            Distribution Commission that they cannot expect any rubber whatsoever
                            from the United States or from the countries with whom the United States
                            has purchase contracts until Argentina has actually placed into effect
                            restrictions proportionately equal in their importance to those already
                            in force in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Early instructions from the Department as to any further position the
                            Embassy should take would be greatly appreciated.</p>

                            and the English translation<note n="29" xml:id="d312fn30">Not

                            Reference is also made to Embassy’s despatch No. 4935 of May 4,
                                1942.<note n="29" xml:id="d312fn33">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>After briefly studying the present proposal, it is difficult to see where
                            the Argentine Government has made any headway in the past two months.
                            The situation is basically the same as described in the above despatch.
                            In brief, Argentina has really put in little or no actual restriction on
                            the use of rubber. It will be noted, for example, in the first table,
                            under paragraph 2, that the presumed consumption of rubber in all
                            branches is greater in 1942 than it was in 1941. This is accounted for,
                            presumably, by reason of a reduction in imports of rubber manufacturers.
                            It is true that they suggest sharp reductions in the use of crude
                            rubber, ranging from 40% for shoe manufacture to 55% for industrial,
                            medicinal and miscellaneous, with 45% reduction planned for tires, tubes
                            and repair materials. If these restrictions were actually in effect, the
                            case would be considerably more convincing. Dr. Raúl E. Arrarás Vergara,
                            who signs the present informal proposal, is the representative of the
                            Ministry of Agriculture on the Argentine Rubber Rationing Commission and
                            has also been officially designated to discuss a rubber modus vivendi
                            with <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0330"/>the United States. The
                            position of our Government, as set forth in Department’s circular
                            telegram of May 18 midnight,<note n="31" xml:id="d312fn31">See footnote
                                21, <ref target="#pg_315">p. 315</ref>.</note> which was transmitted
                            by Embassy note No. 750 of May 21, 1942, to the Foreign Minister, has
                            been explained. Further discussions have been very frank to the effect
                            that the Argentine stock position is comparatively better than that of
                            the United States considering demand, and that in view of this, it is
                            quite improbable that our Government would be able to set aside further
                            quantities of rubber for uses now prohibited in the United States.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that Dr. Arrarás Vergara understands thoroughly this point
                            of view, but as he explains it, his problem is that of facing the
                            different Argentine manufacturers, who are demanding that the Government
                            provide ways and means of obtaining rubber from other American
                            republics. Consequently, while he personally agrees that it would be
                            better for Argentina to reach a modus vivendi with the United States,
                            and withdraw from attempts to make purchase contracts with the other
                            republics, it is thought that he personally fears the political pressure
                            that would be brought by domestic manufacturers, should they be forced
                            to drastically curtail their crude rubber consumption.</p>
                        <p>With this in mind, the discussion outlined under paragraph 4 was drafted.
                            Likewise, Dr. Arrarás Vergara is now in Bolivia and when he left Buenos
                            Aires, planned to go on to Peru. The proposal to be made to Peru is
                            that, although the United States has a purchase contract with that
                            country, Argentina could still supply rubber manufacturers, provided
                            some Peruvian crude rubber could be diverted to Argentina.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy would appreciate instructions as to whether or not the United
                            States is prepared to entertain a formal proposal of the Argentine
                            Government to negotiate a rubber modus vivendi. At the same time it is
                            presumed that with the conclusion of purchase contracts by the United
                            States with Bolivia and Ecuador, the Argentine Government will realize
                            that no substantial quantities of crude rubber can be obtained from
                            those sources. It may then be willing to treat Argentine crude rubber
                            requirements the same as those of other critically important materials.
                            The Department will recall that rubber was made a special exception by
                            reason of the sudden appearance of the decree providing for the Rubber
                            Commission and giving to the Ministry of Agriculture the control over
                            acquisition and importation of that product. (See voluntary report No.
                            870, March 6, 1942, and Embassy’s despatch No. 4339, March 6,
                                1942.)<note n="32" xml:id="d312fn32">Neither printed.</note> The <pb
                                n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0331"/>accomplishments to date of the
                            Commission have not been substantial, probably for the same political
                            reasons mentioned above which have hindered the adoption of any
                            forthright restrictions on consumption.</p>
                        <p>There is one further point meriting attention, although only indirectly
                            connected with the Argentine proposal. This has to do with the American
                            companies—Goodyear and Firestone. Actually, their branches are Argentine
                            companies and the local managers are interested in maintaining their
                            plants at a level of production that will at least in some way be
                            economical. Consequently, while they would prefer to look to the United
                            States for rubber, they do not feel that it would be advisable to give
                            the impression to the Argentine authorities that they do not wish to
                            cooperate with any program devised for the purpose of obtaining more
                            crude rubber for Argentine manufacturers, regardless of the source from
                            whence it comes. Again, presumably, the contracts with Ecuador and
                            Bolivia should automatically solve this problem, but the Department’s
                            opinion, especially as regards the position of the American companies,
                            would also be appreciated.</p>

                        <p>There exists in the Argentine an embargo on the export of beryl ore.
                            There is great need of beryl ore in the United States, and our Embassy
                            in Buenos Aires has repeatedly pointed this out to the appropriate
                            authorities. Six months ago the Argentine Government gave as its reason
                            for the maintenance of the embargo its desire to assure sufficient beryl
                            ore for the Saba Plant which manufactures beryl oxide. The Saba Plant is
                            anxious to find a market for this oxide.</p>
                        <p>In May 1942 our Embassy in Buenos Aires was informed that the Metals
                            Reserve Company was prepared to make a proposed contract with the Saba
                            Plant effective contingent upon the granting by the Argentine Government
                            of export licenses for export to the United States of the accumulated
                            stocks of beryl ore and contingent upon an agreement to grant licenses
                            at the rate of a minimum of 100 tons of ore monthly out of current
                            production. The request was also made that since consumption of the Saba
                            Plant will be only about 1,000 tons of ore per year, export licenses
                            should be granted for any quantity in excess of this requirement of
                            Saba, but no less than 1,200 tons annually.</p>
                        <p>Our Embassy reported in August that the matter had been submitted to the
                            Inter-Ministerial Commission. In September our Embassy reported that no
                            reply had been received and that the Foreign Office had been informed
                            that on about September 15 freight space would be available for the
                            shipment of the accumulated stocks of beryl ore estimated at 800 tons
                            and that, therefore, an early reply would be appreciated. The Foreign
                            Office stated that the question would be submitted to the
                            Inter-Ministerial Commission shortly.</p>

                        <p>Since it now appears that the requirements of the Saba Plant have been
                            taken care of and that the Metals Reserve Company is prepared to put
                            into effect the proposed contract with Saba contingent upon an agreement
                            to assure export licenses for beryl ore as described above, it would be
                            greatly appreciated if the Argentine Government would take action to
                            permit the freight space available in the immediate future to be used
                            for the export of beryl ore to the United States, and would agree to the
                            future export of beryl ore in the amounts described above.</p>

                        <p>1397. 1. In view of protracted delay in effecting arrangements for the
                            procurement of beryl, it was suggested at a meeting of representatives
                            of interested agencies that you call together Messrs. Hughes, Jahns,
                            Singewald, and Bates<note n="34" xml:id="d315fn34">Thomas L. Hughes,
                                Commercial Attaché in Argentina; William F. Jahns, Joseph T.
                                Singewald, Jr., and Bennett R. Bates, members of a mission sent to
                                Argentina by the Board of Economic Warfare.</note> for the purpose
                            of reviewing the question of beryl procurement in Argentina and making
                            such recommendations as, in your opinion, will best facilitate immediate
                            procurement and dispose of existing vexatious questions.</p>
                        <p>2. In substitution of the proposal made in the Department’s no. 656 of
                            May 12, 1 p.m., it has been suggested that Metals Reserve might make a
                            blanket offer to buy the entire Argentine production of beryllium
                            products whether in the form of ore or of oxide leaving it entirely to
                            the Argentine Government to control the amount of the productions of
                            each material. Such proposal would contemplate no stipulation regarding
                            maximum or minimum quantities but would of course call for removal of
                            existing embargo on ore.</p>
                        <p>3. With respect to the question of our extending assistance in plant
                            expansion to stimulate production of oxide, we believe it would be most
                            difficult to provide necessary equipment during the course of the war.
                            There is also the question whether supplies of beryl or oxide may be
                            going forward to the Axis from Argentina through submarine shipment or
                            other means. Do you believe such to be the case? We naturally should not
                            wish plant expansion promoted by us to result in augmenting any such
                            shipments.</p>
                        <p>4. Is it your opinion that delay hitherto affecting arrangements springs
                            from obstructive purposes designed to induce us to believe that we can
                            eventually obtain Argentine beryl without there being any bona fide
                            intention to supply it?</p>
                        <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0334"/>
                        <p>5. Your full comment will be appreciated on the foregoing items together
                            with such other suggestions and comment as you may have to offer. If the
                            foregoing proposal is not satisfactory can you make a concrete
                            proposal?</p>
                        <p>6. In connection with the foregoing care should be exercised that nothing
                            should be said or done to prejudice anticipated favorable replies to the
                            representations already made as set forth in the Department’s no. 1314
                            of September 3, 5 p.m. and no. 1366 of September 12, 10 p.m.<note n="35"

                        <p>1483. From Metals Reserve. Your 1860 [<hi rend="italic">1840</hi>] of
                            September 22. You are hereby authorized to inform the Argentine
                            government that the Metals Reserve Company considers the contract of
                            March 3 [<hi rend="italic">4</hi>], with the Sociedad Anónima Berilo
                            Argentina for 200 metric tons of beryllium oxide to be in effect and
                            that clause 4 under “Special Conditions” on the third page of the
                            contract has been stricken out. This is the clause that refers to the
                            agreement between the United States and Argentine Governments.</p>
                        <p>This action has been taken with the understanding that the Argentine
                            government will issue export licenses immediately for the export of 500
                            metric tons of beryl ore now available in Argentina and that it will
                            make additional export licenses available at a rate of 100 metric tons
                            of beryl ore monthly hereafter, if available. Metals Reserve Company
                            further agrees that the prices paid for Argentine beryl ore will conform
                            to those paid for ores imported by it in similar transactions with other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The attention of the Embassy is called to the fact that it would be
                            extremely undesirable to have the entire 500 tons for which export
                            license is to be issued shipped to this country on a single steamer. It
                            is desired that the material be shipped in several lots with,
                            preferably, not more than 200 tons in any single shipment. This fact has
                            been communicated to Watson Geach &amp; Co., agents for South American
                            Mining Co., which has sold beryllium ore to Metals Reserve Company, but
                            is being repeated to the Embassy to insure that the policy is carried
                            out. Please advise Williams. [Metals Reserve.]</p>

                        <p>The Department is giving consideration to a plan submitted by Treasury to
                            control transactions undertaken by cloaks with respect to articles
                            exported from the United States. Exporters in the United States would
                            file an extra copy of export declaration, which would be dispatched
                            immediately by airmail to the appropriate American mission. The American
                            mission would then examine these declarations to determine whether
                            cloaks or Proclaimed List nationals were involved. With respect to
                            shipments in which such a person has an interest, the information would
                            immediately be transmitted to the Department with a view to stopping the
                            shipment or preventing delivery to the consignee through the cooperation
                            of Canal Zone authorities, the British and the shipping lines
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>Please advise the Department whether such a plan would be practical from
                            an administrative angle in so far as your mission and the consulates
                            subject to your jurisdiction are concerned. In addition the Department
                            would appreciate an expression of your views in general.</p>

                        <p>64. Department’s circular telegram December 6, 9 p.m. Control of
                            importations from the United States by cloaks was carefully discussed
                            with the Ravndal Mission<note n="42" xml:id="d322fn42">Christian M.
                                Ravndal, Assistant Chief of the Division of the American Republics,
                                was instructed on November 19, 1941, to discuss with the American
                                Missions in South America policies and procedures relating to export
                                control, priorities, the freezing of foreign funds, and the
                                Proclaimed List.</note> and this Embassy is also of the opinion that
                            only by careful control both here and in Washington may shipment <pb
                                n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0338"/>be prevented from reaching
                            undesirable hands. For example, Armco International was recently advised
                            that several firms not their customers are arbitrarily using Armco’s
                            name as supplier and enlisting support of Argentine Embassy to obtain
                            high priority rating.</p>
                        <p>As it would be exceedingly difficult if not impossible to prevent
                            delivery to consignee of shipments which may have already left the
                            United States it would appear that a thorough check made prior to the
                            embarkation would be more practicable. If the Department were to
                            reinstate the system of individual license and were to forward daily to
                            the Embassy an airmail list of all requests for export license for
                            Argentina, listing the firm making the request, the consignee and the
                            material concerned, it would be possible for this Embassy to determine
                            each doubtful case and to advise by cable or airmail whether or not in
                            our opinion the transaction is bona fide and whether the license should
                            be issued. This system would supplant that now in effect of sending a
                            special cable on each suspicious case and it is believed that it would
                            provide a thorough control such as is not now possible under general
                            license and occasional cables.</p>

                                Defense/l791a,<note n="43" xml:id="d323fn43">Not printed.</note>
                            concerning the proposed procedure to be followed in the distribution of
                            any product allocated by the United States.</p>
                        <p>This Embassy is concerned with the procedure providing for issuance of
                            the certificate of necessity by the foreign country, in this case
                            Argentina.</p>
                        <p>In the case of tinplate, for example, the Argentine Government recently
                            made a partial distribution involving 16, 194 metric tons of the
                            approximately 27,000 tons allocated to this country for the first
                            quarter of 1942. Further, the Central Bank immediately advised the
                            individual firms as to the quota pertaining to each. The Bank has also
                            shown us a copy of the cable from the Argentine Embassy in Washington to
                            the effect that the State Department approved of the allocation made by
                            the Bank.</p>
                        <p>With one exception, that distribution was made on the basis of 1940
                            consumption. For the first quarter of 1942, however, the semi fiscal <pb
                                n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0339"/>Corporación Argentina de
                            Productores de Carnes (CAP) was granted a total of 200% of the tinplate
                            used by the Company throughout the year 1940, whereas in other cases the
                            distribution consistently approximated 25% of 1940 performance. This
                            matter was called to the attention of the Central Bank, which entity
                            insists that not only did they have the State Department’s approval, but
                            that the allocation was justified by reason of purchase by the CAP of a
                            small <hi rend="italic">frigorífico</hi><note n="44" xml:id="d323fn44"
                                >Packing house or cold storage plant.</note> in Concordia. It was
                            further stated by the Central Bank that they have subsequently received
                            advice from their Embassy in Washington to the effect that the State
                            Department has asked them to immediately distribute 54,000 tons of the
                            total allocation of 77,500 tons granted Argentina for all of 1942, and
                            that in said distribution each <hi rend="italic">frigorífico</hi> would
                            be guaranteed as much tinplate as it needs up to a maximum production
                            capacity. This has since been done by decree of January 27, 1942.</p>
                        <p>While this distribution would appear to be fair, it would be regrettable
                            if the Argentine Government were to understand that the United States
                            approved of an 800% increase in the quota for the CAP, while at the same
                            time other producing units were held at their 1940 production levels.
                            Consequently, it is respectfully suggested that the Argentine Embassy be
                            advised that any approval given by the Department was only for the
                            purpose of expediting the deliveries of tinplate and could not be
                            construed as an approval of the actual distribution. Otherwise, should a
                            greater shortage arise in the future, the Argentine Government may plead
                            that the precedent has already been established whereby the CAP is
                            justified to a share equal to or in some cases larger than the other <hi
                                rend="italic">frigoríficos</hi> who have been heavy producers for
                            years. The basic features governing production capacity include first,
                            the number of animals available and, second, the amount of machinery of
                            each establishment.</p>
                        <p>This same situation is anticipated for the Yacimientos Petrolíferos
                            Fiscales (YPF—Government Oil Fields) and, possibly, for some private
                            concerns of considerable influence. In order to avoid such a difficulty,
                            it would seem preferable that the power of redress which the Board of
                            Economic Warfare retains, could better be exercised before the firms
                            here are advised by the Argentine Government as to their particular
                            quotas. It is believed that the full cooperation of the Central Bank can
                            be obtained to the end that the Embassy confer with them before each
                            individual firm is advised of its quota. The critical analyses of the
                            Central Bank requirements studies which the Embassy is now preparing and
                            forwarding to Washington contain complete recommendations as to
                            distribution by firms. Hence, in <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0340"
                            />each case where these analyses have been prepared, the Embassy could
                            immediately make its recommendations to the Central Bank. In those cases
                            where no agreement is reached, an explanatory despatch would be prepared
                            by the Embassy for the Board of Economic Warfare for its guidance. By
                            this method, both embarrassment and unjust discrimination should be
                            avoided.</p>

                        <p>239. In analyzing the import requirements studies of the Central Bank it
                            is noted that several Government departments are requesting large
                            amounts of various materials heretofore not imported by them direct.
                            Likewise the practice whereby Proclaimed List construction companies
                            obtain government contracts at exceedingly low bids is of increasing
                            concern, as this Embassy is convinced that these contracts are let in
                            most if not all cases on the supposition if not tacit understanding that
                            the Government itself will obtain from the United States the necessary
                            raw materials delivering them in turn to the construction firms
                            successful in obtaining government contracts.</p>
                        <p>In view of the policy expressed in the Department’s 151, February 4, 9
                                p.m.<note n="46" xml:id="d324fn46"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref
                                    target="#pg_377">p. 377</ref>.</note> I believe the Argentine
                            Government should be informed to the effect that no material can be
                            allocated direct to government departments for work let or to be let on
                            a contract basis but that rather it will be the responsibility of the
                            individual contractor to obtain this material in his own name. In as
                            much as the Argentine Central Bank is authorized to make both the import
                            requirements studies and the recommendations of the Argentine Government
                            as to the local distribution of materials allocated by the United
                            States, I believe the Department may wish this point of view <pb n="329"

                        <p>I would appreciate early instructions on this point.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Welles</hi>: It is my understanding that we have
                            adopted a definitively negative policy toward Argentina in regard to:
                                (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the shipment to that country of war
                            material and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the conclusion of an over-all
                            purchase agreement covering strategic materials.</p>
                        <p>The question which now arises in acute form is the policy to be adopted
                            regarding the export to Argentina of scarce materials. These materials
                            are vitally important to the economic activities of the country. No
                            policy of restriction below the extremely low levels made necessary in
                            the case of the American republics as a whole could be effective in the
                            case of Argentina without British cooperation. I do not think that we
                            would wish to ask for such cooperation or that any specific
                            discrimination against Argentina in this matter would be a contribution
                            to the war effort.</p>
                        <p>I therefore recommend that our allocations, priorities, and export
                            license policies toward Argentina be handled on the same basis as toward
                            the other American republics. It seems to me that to proceed otherwise
                            would be to fail to take a realistic view of Argentina’s importance to
                            us and to the British at this time.</p>

                                xml:id="pg_330" facs="0342"/>It is useless for us to work with the
                            bank and to insist to individual importers that they do not qualify for
                            quotas under allocation when at the same time they are able to see by
                            the manifests of incoming ships that large quantities of iron and steel
                            and other products subject to allocation are constantly arriving,
                            consigned either to order or to firms which would not normally be

                                >Penelope</hi>, referred to in cable under reply, brought a total of
                            178 consignments covering 5269 long tons of iron and steel. Of these, 97
                            consignments, covering 2400 tons, came to firms who would either not
                            merit any quota, or to order, or to other entities which in numerous
                            cases the Embassy has reason to believe are instrumental in providing
                            materials for Proclaimed List firms. It is difficult to understand why
                            export licenses are granted in such questionable cases without referring
                            the matter to this Embassy, while at the same time a transaction
                            involving the International General Electric Company, Incorporated, and
                            the Compañía Argentina de Electricidad is made the subject of a special
                            inquiry, even though it involved only 475 pounds of mica tape and strips
                            (Department’s 342, March 11, 6 p.m.<note n="50" xml:id="d326fn50">Not

                        <p>A further result of the present practice is the following: The German
                            chemical and pharmaceutical firms, whose monthly sales turnover is 5
                            million pesos and whose profits are sufficiently large to enable them to
                            be the most effective contributors to the German propaganda machine, are
                            still obtaining all their requirements through a series of small
                            intermediaries in the United States and here. Química Merck, one of the
                            leading German firms, is now advertising recently received American
                            drugs as made in the United States but bottled by Merck here as
                            propaganda to their clients that the Proclaimed List and the export
                            control system of the United States is ineffectual as far as the Axis is
                            concerned. This is but one of many examples.</p>
                        <p>As the Department feels that the recommendation of Embassy’s 372 [<hi
                                rend="italic">322</hi>], February 22 [<hi rend="italic"

                            effect that no further export licenses be granted for products subject
                            to allocation unless accompanied by the corresponding certificate of
                            necessity or in lieu thereof special recommendation of this Embassy,
                            would result in delays in shipping and in upsetting of production
                            schedules, it is suggested that effective control could still be
                            maintained through application of the recommendation contained in
                            Embassy’s 64, January 10, 2 p.m. This suggested that Department forward
                            daily to this Embassy an air mail list of all requests <pb n="331"
                                xml:id="pg_331" facs="0343"/>for export licenses for Argentina,
                            listing the firm making the request, the consignee, the material
                            concerned, its volume and value.</p>
                        <p>(Section 2) This system should be employed for all merchandise until such
                            time as final decision on allocations procedure is taken. Thereafter it
                            should still be applied to all merchandise not subject to allocation.
                            There would be relatively little delay if the Department were to follow
                            this suggestion, since the Embassy’s recommendation on each application
                            for export license could be in Washington within 1 week from the time
                            the application was made. This would eliminate a term of shipping delays
                            and the upsetting of production schedules, but it would at the same time
                            effectively stop both speculation, which is everywhere in evidence at
                            present, and the shipment of merchandise which we are confident now
                            finds its way into the hands of Axis firms.</p>
                        <p>I feel sure Department will appreciate the difficult position in which
                            Embassy finds itself as regards work with the Argentine Government in
                            the mutual attempt properly to control destination and distribution of
                            the limited critical and strategic materials which we are in a position
                            to provide for Argentina’s most imperative needs. Furthermore, the
                            practice which now allows indiscriminate shipments to reach Argentina
                            does not appear consistent with the policy which I understand was
                            adopted following the Rio Conference.<note n="51" xml:id="d326fn51"

                            raise questions which you may wish to have in mind. Yesterday in a
                            conversation with Sir Frederick Phillips<note n="54" xml:id="d328fn54"
                                >British Treasury Representative in the United States.</note> he
                            stressed the growing concern of the British Treasury on the increasing
                            British sterling obligations, mentioning specifically obligations
                            arising out of essential purchases in South America, chiefly in
                            Argentina and Brazil. The British will probably be apprehensive if our
                            proposal to them meant reducing the total amount of exports which they
                            could make at this time and which were meant to reduce their sterling
                            obligations. This does not mean that they cannot shift exports from one
                            commodity to another; but even here there may be some difficulty since,
                            for instance, recent cables indicate that they are reducing textile
                            production in order to transfer workers to other industries.</p>
                        <p>I do not raise these considerations to suggest that the point that we are
                            raising is not sound but merely to anticipate observations that Lord
                            Halifax may make, the answer to which is that obviously in the
                            application of principle considerable study and flexibility will be
                            necessary.</p>

                        <p>In the light of the acute shortage in the joint supply of certain
                            strategic materials available to the Governments of the United States
                            and Great Britain, and of the increasing demands of the United Nations
                            for such materials, it is desired to bring to the attention of the
                            British Government certain aspects of the problem of supplying
                            restricted commodities to Argentina.</p>
                        <p>The appropriate export agencies of the United States Government have
                            endeavored primarily to meet the material needs of the United Nations
                            and, secondarily, to strengthen so far as possible the national
                            economies of those nations which have associated themselves with the
                            objectives of the United Nations by severing relations with the Axis
                            powers. This course of action has been dictated as much by necessity <pb
                                n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0345"/>as by choice, since the
                            available supplies of many essential materials have been extremely
                            limited.</p>
                        <p>In the implementation of this twofold policy, this Government has been
                            forced to reject an increasing portion of the export license
                            applications covering proposed shipments of scarce commodities to
                            Argentina and to make certain reductions in the allocations of such
                            commodities which would normally be made to that country. The effect of
                            this policy, therefore, is to make certain strategic materials available
                            for distribution among those nations which are assisting directly or
                            indirectly in the war effort.</p>
                        <p>It would clearly not redound to the benefit of the United Nations or
                            their sympathizers if the deficiencies thus suffered by Argentina were
                            fully compensated by the shipment of offsetting amounts of certain
                            strategic materials from British sources. The cooperation of the British
                            Government is therefore desired in the task of assuring that in this
                            connection the limited supplies available will be conserved for purposes
                            of the united war effort.</p>
                        <p>In the event that the British Government concurs in principle with the
                            considerations set forth above, this Government will welcome a
                            discussion relative to specific commodities, the shortage of which has
                            necessitated the proposed course of action.</p>

                            policy you and Ambassador Armour agreed upon at Rio de Janeiro, and
                            which has since been followed by the Department, the BEW<note n="56"

                            give Argentina the reduced set of figures for second quarter
                            allocations. These have been worked out, in consultation with our
                            Embassy at Buenos Aires, on the basis of a policy of continuing to
                            furnish those products necessary to maintain public health, essential
                            transportation, et cetera, and of such other products which should not
                            more appropriately be given to those countries which are collaborating
                            more effectively in the war effort. The application of this policy has
                            resulted <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0346"/>in a curtailment of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Welles</hi>: Dr. García Arias, of the Argentine
                            Embassy, came in this morning and drew my attention to the attached
                            article headed “Ban on shipments to Argentina is on” in the <hi
                                rend="italic">New York Times</hi> of this morning. The article
                            emphasizes the fact that there is discrimination between Argentina and
                            Chile, with the latter being favored.</p>
                        <p>Dr. García Arias expressed the opinion that articles of this nature
                            produce a most unfortunate effect in Argentina, particularly at this
                            time when Admiral Sueyro and General Lapez<note n="59" xml:id="d331fn59"
                                >Rear Adm. Sabá Sueyro and Brig. Gen. Bduardo T. Lapez headed an
                                Argentine military purchasing mission to the United States; for
                                correspondence on this mission, see <ref target="#pg_371">pp.
                                    371</ref> ff.</note> are explaining to Argentine officials and
                            others the attitude of the United States. It was Dr. García Arias’
                            suggestion that at one of your press conferences you refer to this
                            article and state that the isolated examples therein described could in
                            no sense be considered representative of United States policy.</p>
                        <p>Dr. García Arias and I then discussed the entire situation of
                            Argentine-United States relations in a general way without arriving at
                            any very novel conclusions.</p>
                        <p>I am aware that our policy toward Argentina has been given the most
                            careful consideration. It is therefore with some diffidence that I
                            express the view that there are only two effective policies open to us:
                                (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) economic cooperation on the same basis as
                            with other American republics, and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) economic
                            warfare. A policy which merely places Argentina in a somewhat less
                            favorable position than the other republics in the distribution of the
                            limited amount of export materials which we can spare is one which will
                            merely cause irritation without, in my opinion, producing any favorable
                            effect upon Argentina’s foreign policy. On the other hand, the attitude
                            which we have taken regarding military matériel is perfectly sound and
                                <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0347"/>realistic; it places
                            Argentina at a real disadvantage in relation to Brazil and should exert
                            a considerable leverage on military, naval, and political circles.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Dean</hi>: The Embassy at Buenos Aires is so
                            exercised about the ineffectiveness of export controls that I thought it
                            desirable to report to you. I understand that Mr. Armour may supplement
                            the Embassy’s strong telegram on this subject (No. 477, March 12, 2 p.m.
                                [<hi rend="italic">midnight</hi>]) with a personal letter to Mr.
                            Welles.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the points made in the Embassy’s telegram, the staff has
                            told me the following: Many new shoestring operators have mushroomed
                            into the import field in Argentina. They are prepared to act as cloaks
                            for blacklisted concerns in return for the high prices which the latter
                            are willing to pay. Established importers are more reluctant to run the
                            risks involved in cloaking.</p>
                        <p>These new importers have their counterparts in the States where many new
                            exporters have recently sprung up. These exporters appear to be working
                            with the cloaks down here because the latter will pay more than the
                            established importing units in Argentina. OPA’s<note n="63"
                                xml:id="d334fn63">Office of Price Administration.</note> price
                            ceilings are often circumvented by concealed arrangements for extra
                            compensation.</p>
                        <p>Export controls, in the States, have apparently been ineffective as a
                            means of stopping shipments to questionable consignees in Argentina. The
                            Embassy states that this is true even of those commodities subject to
                            specific licensing requirements. In fact, the Embassy states—this
                            appears to be an exaggeration—that export controls have operated in
                            reverse, permitting shipments to new and doubtful consignees while
                            blocking them to old reliable concerns. The administration of the
                            controls has, according to the Embassy, been so capricious and perverse
                            that local importers and officials grin slyly, put it all down to
                            grafting by the authorities in the States, and consider it a first-class
                            scandal.</p>
                        <p>I believe that <hi rend="italic">some</hi> of the Embassy’s indignation
                            results from inadequate information regarding the time when the
                            requirement of a specific export license is imposed on particular
                            commodities, and from inadequate information in general concerning the
                            operation of export controls, allocations, etc. As a result of lacking
                            adequate information, 1) The Embassy often suspects that shipments have
                            arrived because of stupid or irregular issuance of export licenses when,
                            in fact, the <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0349"/>difficulty lies in
                            the absence of any requirement of an export license. 2) The Embassy is
                            not in position to explain away to the Central Bank, or to reliable
                            concerns which have been denied licenses, shipments of commodities which
                            left the States a few days before the requirement of a specific license
                            was imposed. 3) The Embassy lacks an adequate framework of reference for
                            its investigations, often seeking to determine the method by which a
                            license was secured by an undesirable when the commodity involved was
                            not subject to the requirement of a specific license at the time it left
                            the States.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed the whole question of information with appropriate
                            members of the Embassy staff, all of whom say that Washington has kept
                            them very poorly informed. Mr. Lankenau,<note n="64" xml:id="d334fn64"
                                >Richard F. Lankenau, junior economic analyst in the Embassy in
                                Argentina.</note> who is assigned to export control matters, has
                            prepared a despatch to Mr. Ravndal, urgently requesting certain
                            specified information, and proposing a procedure whereby he may be kept
                            informed in the future.</p>
                        <p>I have not been able to check the merit of the Embassy’s objections with
                            respect to specific cases, and I recognize the possibility of another
                            Pennzoil dud.<note n="65" xml:id="d334fn65">This is a reference to an
                                unsupported surmise that the Pennzoil firm shipped oil to a

                            full report on all questionable shipments, giving the names of ships,
                            days of departure and arrival, names of consignees and shippers and
                            quantities consigned, be transmitted to the Department so that specific
                            cases can be checked by B.E.W., and flaws of [<hi rend="italic">or</hi>]
                            irregularities in control system be discovered.</p>
                        <p>I have also suggested that the Embassy quickly report to Washington any
                            evidence that price ceilings in the States are being violated by
                            exporters there. In this connection, OPA may, with respect to
                            price-controlled commodities, be of some assistance in reducing
                            questionable shipments. Exporters in the States may be encouraging or
                            winking at such shipments because they can be made at prices well in
                            excess of price ceilings. A vigorous enforcement of those ceilings as
                            they relate to exports may remove economic incentive for dealing with
                            questionable customers and thereby cut down such dealings.</p>
                        <p>As you know, several measures have been suggested for tightening up
                            export controls down here: <list>

                                    this by administrative or shipping difficulties. I have

                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Embassy favors the first two measures, and particularly the second.
                            If, as seems to be the case, difficulties here result from the repeated
                            issuance of licenses to questionable consignees or for suspiciously
                            large amounts, a trial of the second measure is warranted—unless
                            administrative or shipping difficulties make it unfeasible. In
                            connection with measure 3, a greater degree of skepticism in Washington,
                            particularly in relation to shipments of unusual quantities, would seem
                            to be in order.</p>
                        <p>Some skulduggery may be taking place in the form of forging of
                            certificates of necessity which are issued by the Central Bank. As you
                            know, the Bank issues a numbered certificate to appropriate importers,
                            and forwards a copy to the Embassy. Since the Embassy does not forward
                            copies to Washington, there appears to be no basis for an adequate check
                            of the authenticity of the certificate of necessity in Washington.
                            Although there is no indication that forgery has occurred, it would seem
                            desirable to have summaries of the certificates transmitted to
                            Washington so that they can be checked against export applications. The
                            Embassy is of the opinion that such a procedure would be desirable and
                            would involve only a negligible administrative burden. I have asked the
                            Embassy to submit its views to the Department.</p>

                        <p>513. Embassy’s 477, March 12, midnight. The Department is convinced that
                            the only way in which the situation described can be rectified is to
                            call in all outstanding Argentine licenses issued between October 10 and
                            March 1 and refer them to the Embassy for recommendation; and the
                            Department is prepared to request the Board of Economic Warfare to do
                            this. (By <hi rend="italic">Current Controls Bulletin</hi> No. 11 of
                            March 14,<note n="68" xml:id="d336fn68">The <hi rend="italic">Current

                                Export Control of the Board of Economic Warfare.</note> all
                            individual export licenses dated prior to October 10 were revoked
                            effective midnight April 10 and all outstanding licenses issued on or
                            after October 10 will be valid for 6 months only).</p>
                        <p>As similar action is not at present contemplated with regard to any other
                            American Republic, and since the Department is most anxious that no
                            action should be taken which might give the Argentine Government grounds
                            for alleging pressure or discrimination, the Department is, however,
                            unwilling to make the request without the knowledge and consent of the
                            Argentine Government.</p>
                        <p>Please take this matter up with the Foreign Office making it clear that
                            the proposed course is the only practicable way in which speculators and
                            other undesirable consignees can be eliminated.</p>
                        <p>You may add that the Argentine Embassy has informally suggested that
                            licenses be recalled as outlined in order to permit its Government to
                            regularize its own internal procedure.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I refer to your telegram No. 477 of March
                            12, 1942 in which it is stated that the distribution in Argentina of
                            materials imported from the United States is most unsatisfactory, owing
                            to the fact that export licenses are issued without due respect to the
                            merits of the consignee or purchaser. The suggestion was made that all
                            applications for licenses be sent to the Embassy for recommendation
                            before action is taken upon them.</p>
                        <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0352"/>
                        <p>I have been advised by the Office of Export Control of the Board of
                            Economic Warfare that it is not practicable to delay consideration of
                            all applications for license to export materials to Argentina until the
                            Embassy has given its recommendations with respect to such applications.
                            An alternative procedure, however, has been suggested which appears to
                            be fairly satisfactory in that it will give the Embassy an opportunity
                            to review a majority of the applications approved. This procedure, which
                            is being inaugurated with the forwarding of this instruction, is to
                            transmit daily to the Embassy copies of the reports of the Special
                            Committee which passes on applications for license to export to
                            Argentina. These reports which embody the decisions of the Committee on
                            all applications reviewed by it will be forwarded henceforth by airmail
                            without covering instructions. This Committee takes action on all
                            applications which have a value of $500 or more, and it is understood
                            that the volume of applications considered by it represents over eighty
                            per cent of all applications for license to export to Argentina and
                            includes all items of significance. The Department is represented on
                            this Committee which was established on February 16, 1942 and which has
                            been implementing the Department’s policy with respect to Argentina.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that these daily reports of the Committee’s decisions
                            include the name of the applicant, description of the material,
                            including the volume and value, the names of the consignee and
                            purchaser, and, in the case of a rejection, the reason for the action
                            taken. The Embassy should review these decisions promptly and telegraph
                            the Department immediately if it disapproves the granting of a license
                            in any instance. The Embassy should not, except in exceptional cases,
                            advise the Department regarding the decisions of the Committee to reject
                            applications, as due consideration has been given to the supply
                            situation in each instance before this decision was made. As soon as the
                            Department is informed by the Embassy that it disapproves the granting
                            of a particular license, the Office of Export Control will be notified,
                            and that agency has agreed to immediately revoke the license in
                            question. If the Embassy acts promptly in forwarding recommendations,
                            revocation of licenses can be made before shipment of the goods has been
                            made. This procedure should give the Embassy the means of preventing the
                            shipment of all significant items.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the statement in the telegram under reference that
                            license applications are approved without due consideration to the
                            merits of the consignee, I should like to point out that, under present
                            procedure, all applications must indicate the names of the consignee and
                            purchaser, and these names are checked by the Office of Export Control
                            against the Proclaimed List and the Confidential List. Apparently, these
                            lists are incomplete and unsatisfactory, and, if the above-outlined
                            procedure does not work out satisfactorily, it would <pb n="341"
                                xml:id="pg_341" facs="0353"/>appear advisable for the Embassy to
                            prepare a White List against which all applications could be
                            checked.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the statement in your telegram under reference that
                            goods are arriving consigned “to order”, the Office of Export Control
                            advises that applications are only granted when the names of the
                            consignee and purchaser are given and that if a shipment is indicated as
                            being consigned “to order”, the application is rejected. It is believed
                            that your impression that licenses are granted for the exportation of
                            goods consigned “to order” may be owing to the fact that ships’
                            manifests often indicate consignments as being “to order”, although the
                            goods in question are covered by a license on which the consignee and
                            purchaser are shown. Licenses are granted, however, to an applicant who
                            indicates that its own subsidiary is the consignee and purchaser. For
                            example, licenses are granted to the United States Steel Corporation for
                            material consigned to the United States Steel Corporation in Argentina.
                            It is assumed that the Embassy can, in a large part, supervise the
                            distribution of materials consigned in this fashion. However, should the
                            Embassy disapprove of the granting of licenses in this manner, you
                            should inform the Department accordingly and the problem will be taken
                            up with the Office of Export Control.</p>
                        <p>I should like to point out that some of the goods arriving in Argentina
                            were undoubtedly licensed prior to the implementation of the present
                            policy which started with the functioning of the Special Committee on
                            February 16. As licenses are valid for six months, consideration is
                            being given to requesting that outstanding licenses be called in for
                            revalidation, at which time these licenses could be revoked in light of
                            the existing policy. However, if this action were taken with respect to
                            Argentine licenses only, such a step might well be called discriminatory
                            and thus not in accord with our announced policy. I should appreciate
                            your views on such a proposal, as well as those on this entire
                            problem.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sumner</hi>: I am glad to acknowledge your
                            letter of March 27,<note n="69" xml:id="d338fn69">Not printed.</note>
                            advising me of the manner in which our export control authorities <pb
                                n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0354"/>have already started to
                            implement our policy of sharing supplies of scarce commodities with
                            countries siding with us. You ask my further comment on the manner in
                            which we may distribute whatever we find it advisable to supply
                            Argentina in such a way that “the friendly majority of the Argentine
                            people would be strengthened at the expense of the unfriendly but
                            influential minority”.</p>
                        <p>First let me reiterate that not only do we in the Embassy and other
                            Americans here, leaders in our business community with whom I have
                            spoken, heartily approve of this policy, but I further believe that a
                            large bulk of the thinking Argentine people are of the same feeling. In
                            this connection you will recall the views expressed by Alexander
                                Shaw<note n="70" xml:id="d338fn70">Alejandro E. Shaw, Argentine
                                economist.</note> in his memorandum, a copy of which I sent you with
                            my letter of April 11.<note n="71" xml:id="d338fn71">Letter of April 11

                                Bonsal in letter of the same date, not printed.</note> Consequently,
                            it is gratifying to note the emphasis given to make this policy
                            thoroughly effective.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed at length with members of the Embassy staff the
                            suggestions contained in your letter, covering diversion of materials
                            through operation on: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>The basis of a confidential white list; or,</item>

                                <item>The basis of reference of questionable license applications to
                                    the Embassy for recommendation; or,</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                                <item>The institution of a general requirement that Certificates of
                                    Necessity accompany all applications for licenses to export
                                    merchandise to Argentina.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>It is our opinion that the third method should be the one employed. It is
                            true that the adoption of the combined white list and reference to the
                            Embassy of questionable license applications would provide excellent
                            export control, but this system could not be applied to products under
                            allocation. The Central Bank would also be left in the same position as
                            now, namely, with no voice in approving the prospective Argentine
                            consignee or consumer. I emphasize this point because of the cooperation
                            which the Embassy has enjoyed with the Central Bank and which I feel
                            should be maintained to the end that unnecessary irritation on the part
                            of the Argentine Government be avoided. At the same time, with the
                            Central Bank we are in a position to be quite frank in all of our
                            discussions, both of policy and procedure.</p>
                        <p>The maintenance of a white list also offers practical difficulties in
                            that many firms of excellent reputation would nevertheless not be
                            acceptable for products which they now desire to import, simply because
                            those products are outside their normal business.</p>

                        <p>Regarding the probable attitude of the Argentine Government, you will be
                            interested to know that only recently Central Bank officials themselves
                            have broached this subject and, in substance, have indicated the hope
                            that a system employing Certificates of Necessity for all imports be
                            adopted. This encourages me even more to recommend that it be placed in
                            effect as soon as is possible.</p>
                        <p>I believe that some of the essential features of the plan would be: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Two series of Certificates of Necessity: one for allocated
                                    products and another for those not subject to allocation.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>A copy of each Certificate issued by the Central Bank to be
                                    supplied to the Embassy immediately.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The Embassy will recommend to the Department action to be
                                    taken on each Certificate; these recommendations would be in
                                    numerical order on a special form. The form would include the
                                    Certificate number, date, to whom issued, volume and value of
                                    product and recommendation of Embassy, with explanation of
                                    reason. These sheets would be forwarded with each air mail pouch
                                    or preferably by courier.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The Department should advise the Embassy immediately of all
                                    rejections.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Neither the Argentine importing firms nor the Central Bank should know
                            the extent of Embassy authority in decisions concerning export licenses,
                            but I believe that the latter should be advised of the general procedure
                            so that its officials will consult freely with the Embassy before
                            issuing Certificates. There is still a tendency on their part to issue
                            certain Certificates and advise us afterwards, a practice which we hope
                            will soon be discontinued.</p>
                        <p>To be successful, this control would require the rejection in Washington
                            of all but very exceptional cases where Certificates of Necessity have
                            not been issued. It will be equally imperative that export licenses be
                            granted for Certificates approved by the Embassy except in those cases
                            where scarcity of the material concerned requires rejection. Probably it
                            will be necessary for the Argentine Government to agree to issue
                            limitation orders in keeping with those issued in the United States. The
                            application of the system will also require a full understanding on our
                            part of general policy as regards use of materials, the issuance of
                            Certificates of Necessity to re-selling firms, relative importance of
                            effect upon the economy of the country and of activities which might be
                            considered as contributing in some way to the war effort. I mention
                            these points in the belief that, while the system could probably be
                            placed in effect through correspondence, the Department may feel that it
                            could be more effectively worked out and subsequent confusion avoided if
                            some officer of the Embassy were to spend a short time in Washington for
                            that purpose. It is also difficult to estimate how much additional work
                            would accrue to the Embassy <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0356"
                            />and, of course, it might be found necessary to request some additional
                            personnel, but it is doubtful if any more would be required under this
                            system than under that utilizing the white list and the reference of
                            questionable applications to the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>I shall await with interest your decision in this matter and in the
                            meantime we shall do everything possible to expedite our replies to the
                            lists you now plan to forward for checking.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: There is enclosed a list of the
                            commodities allocated to Argentina for the second quarter of 1942.<note
                                n="72" xml:id="d339fn72">Not attached to file copy.</note> Iron and
                            steel products, and some other additional items, will be announced
                            shortly.</p>
                        <p>The allocations, as shown, are based largely on the recommendations of
                            your Mission; and in this connection the Department wishes to express to
                            you and your staff its great appreciation of the reports on essential
                            requirements which have been submitted by your office. It is hoped that
                            the reporting officers will continue to spare no effort to supply the
                            Department with this vitally important information. A questionnaire is
                            being prepared for your guidance in collecting and analyzing the type of
                            information of most value to the agencies in Washington.</p>
                        <p>The Department is aware that our Missions have been handicapped by lack
                            of information as to the exact procedure followed in the War Production
                            Board and the Office of Export Control with regard to allocations and
                            the licensing for export of allocated commodities. The following is
                            designed to explain the background of the allocations system and to give
                            the Missions a picture of the situation as it exists today.</p>
                        <p>Last January, it was necessary to announce allocations before the
                            machinery to administer them was set up. Following their announcement,
                            the War Production Board began trying to fit allocations into production
                            schedules. This proved to be so complicated, in view of the rapid
                            conversion of industries to war production, that in effect there was no
                            fixed allocations procedure during the first quarter of the year. The
                            War Production Board, conscious of the necessity of providing for the
                            other American republics, proceeded on the basis of priority <pb n="345"
                                xml:id="pg_345" facs="0357"/>ratings, and it is gratifying to record
                            that very substantial quantities of exports moved forward during a most
                            difficult period.</p>
                        <p>During the first quarter, at the suggestion of this Government, the other
                            American republics set up Certifying Agencies, most of which are now
                            functioning. It has developed rather logically that in many countries
                            the Certificates have become corollary to systems organized to supervise
                            or control the equitable distribution and the price of the commodities
                            upon arrival. Thus, as is evident from despatches received by the
                            Department, the foreign governments are concerned as to the treatment
                            accorded the Certificates by the Office of Export Control.</p>
                        <p>In the first quarter the Office of Export Control approved thousands of
                            applications with and without accompanying Certificates of Necessity.
                            The flow of production and export is a continuous process and could not
                            be held up pending receipt of Certificates. The latter are only now
                            beginning to arrive in substantial numbers. Many of the commodities so
                            licensed have been shipped, others are at seaboard awaiting bottoms,
                            while others are still awaiting their turn for manufacture. Statistics
                            are in preparation to show how much of each allocated commodity was
                            licensed or shipped to each country during the first quarter of
                            1942.</p>
                        <p>The large number of outstanding licenses not covered by Certificates
                            presents a most complicated problem particularly in the matter of
                            coordinating these licenses with the efforts of the Certifying Agencies
                            and control systems in the other American republics. There must be a
                            transition period during which, concurrent with the approval of licenses
                            covered by Certificates, the noncertified outstanding licenses can be
                            worked off. The extent of this transition period cannot be determined at
                            this time, but it may extend as long as through the second quarter, or
                            until September 1, 1942. Attempt to recall or invalidate all outstanding
                            licenses not covered by Certificates might result in interruption to the
                            flow of manufacture and export. In this connection, however, and with
                            special reference to Argentina, the Department refers to the strictly
                            confidential telegram no. 513 of April 13, stating that the Department
                            is willing, under certain stipulated conditions, to suggest to the Board
                            of Economic Warfare that outstanding licenses for Argentina be recalled
                            and submitted to the Embassy for recommendation.</p>
                        <p>These problems, and the questions they involve, have actively concerned
                            the several interested agencies of the Government for several months;
                            and the Department, the War Production Board and the Board of Economic
                            Warfare are still trying to work out a practicable allocations and
                            licensing procedure for the second and subsequent quarters of the year.
                            The successful merging of the existing unsatisfactory <pb n="346"
                                xml:id="pg_346" facs="0358"/>procedure and a new improved procedure
                            constitutes an administrative problem of the first magnitude; the
                            readjustment must be made while administrative processes carry on.</p>
                        <p>The Department is pleased to be able to inform you that the production
                            phase of the allocations system is being worked out rapidly and
                            satisfactorily by the War Production Board. An announcement will shortly
                            be made of a procedure which will (1) require manufacturers of an
                            allocated commodity to reserve a definite portion of their production
                            facilities to accommodate foreign orders within the overall total of the
                            allocation for the industry; (2) require manufacturers to accept foreign
                            orders that have been licensed for export; and (3) help the agents in
                            the United States of foreign customers to find a manufacturer in the
                            event difficulty is experienced in placing the order. Owing to the
                            complexity of modern industrial organization, the implementing of orders
                            issued by the War Production Board may be slightly different as regards
                            different commodities, and announcements will be made in the near future
                            with respect to fixed booking dates, etc., for orders to fit into
                            production schedules for certain forward periods.</p>
                        <p>As for the licensing procedure, and the relation of the Certificate of
                            Necessity thereto, the administrative problem is especially difficult.
                            It is nevertheless hoped that an announcement will soon be made of a
                            procedure which will provide the following: (1) During the transition
                            period of working off the outstanding un-certified licenses, and in
                            order to give certain of the other American republics more time to
                            organize their Certifying Agencies, the Office of Export Control will
                            give definite preference to those license applications covered by
                            Certificates; (2) After a certain date the Office of Export Control will
                            approve only those new applications for license to export which are
                            covered by Certificates of Necessity (Confidential: this is the position
                            being urged by the Department but there is no definite assurance as yet
                            that the Board of Economic Warfare will agree). Thus it is hoped that
                            during the third quarter and thereafter there will be a close
                            coordination between the issuance of licenses and the issuance of
                            Certificates of Necessity so as to enable the other governments to plan
                            effectively the most advantageous distribution of scarce commodities
                            within their economic systems.</p>
                        <p>With regard to other aspects of the allocations and licensing system the
                            Department desires to give the following information in answer to
                            specific questions presented by the Missions: <list>

                                    few, the Certifying Agencies should issue certificates with the

                                    will be considered in relation to the limitation orders

                                <item>The Certificate of Necessity will serve in lieu of a PD–1a
                                    form with regard to an allocated commodity. In this connection,
                                    however, the Certificate should contain full answers to the
                                    questions thereon, particularly as regards the end use of the
                                    commodity, existing inventories, and availability of
                                    substitutes. It is recognized that the Certifying Agencies in
                                    some of the other republics are still in process of organization
                                    and that all are not yet fully equipped to make the detailed
                                    investigations necessary to determine end use of allocated
                                    commodities for presentation on the Certificate form.
                                    Nevertheless, if such agencies, or any other agencies within the
                                    foreign governments, are to supervise the distribution of
                                    commodities after arrival they will eventually need to know such
                                    details. Thus the Missions are urged to encourage the agencies
                                    to persist in obtaining and recording such information, not only
                                    to comply with our requirements but also for their own future
                                    control purposes.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>There are certain vitally important questions regarding allocations
                            procedure which cannot be answered at this time. The first is whether
                            the unused portion of a quarterly allocation will carry forward into
                            subsequent quarters of the year. The problem is so involved that the
                            Requirements Committee has not yet been able to work out a solution. The
                            heavy industries of the United States are working against a strict
                            forward time-table to satisfy the demands of the armed forces of the
                            United Nations, and to attempt to telescope the unused portion of a
                            quarterly allocation into production schedules for following quarters
                            presents serious technical difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The second concerns the determination of what outstanding licenses shall
                            be charged against first quarter allocations. For example, in many cases
                            commodities licensed prior to January 1, 1942 are only now moving
                            forward, while at the same time there are outstanding thousands of first
                            quarter licenses for commodities that have moved forward only in part,
                            and some not at all. The administrative problem of determining the exact
                            status of the commodities that have been licensed, and checking them
                            against factory production schedules and export shipments, is an
                            extremely complicated one. However, the whole problem is receiving
                            urgent attention and it is hoped that a solution will soon be arrived
                            at.</p>
                        <p>During the transitional period the Department appreciates that the
                            position of the Missions in this matter will be a difficult one.
                            However, the Missions should continue to cooperate as fully as possible
                            with the Certifying Agencies and encourage the careful issuance of the
                            Certificates, endeavoring to see that there is no cloaking, and that <pb
                                n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0360"/>established trade channels, and
                            in particular American firms, receive a proportionately fair share of
                            the trade based on past performance.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes it inevitable that as the issuance of
                            Certificates progresses the responsibility of the Missions will
                            increase. It is understood that practically all of the Missions have
                            made informal arrangements with the Certifying Agencies to receive a
                            copy of each Certificate as issued. Needless to say, should the Mission
                            feel that any Certificate issued is not in the best interest of the
                            United States, the Certifying Agency should be approached tactfully with
                            a view to rectification. If the case is judged sufficiently serious to
                            warrant intervention, as a last resort, the Mission can effectively
                            nullify the Certificate by advising the Department in the premises.</p>
                        <p>There is evident a tendency in the other American republics to adopt
                            forms of economic control that are perhaps more comprehensive than the
                            situation warrants. The Department realizes, of course, the sovereign
                            right of the other American republics to institute such controls as they
                            deem necessary to maintain order in their economic systems. In this
                            connection, the Missions should lend their friendly and informal counsel
                            to prevent, if possible, the establishment of controls which appear
                            unnecessarily extensive or impractical. The Missions should be prompt in
                            reporting controls which adversely affect the treaty rights of the
                            United States and its citizens abroad.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s strictly confidential telegram No. 513, April 13, 9 p.m.,
                            in which the Embassy was advised that the Department is prepared to ask
                            the Department of Economic Warfare to reject all outstanding export
                            licenses issued between October 10, 1941 and March 1, 1942, referring
                            them to the Embassy for recommendations. Inasmuch as the same action was
                            not contemplated at this time with regard to any other of the American
                            republics, and since the Department was very anxious that no action be
                            taken which might give the Government of Argentina grounds for alleging
                            discrimination or pressure, the Department was not willing to make the
                            request without the consent and knowledge of the Argentine
                            Government.</p>
                        <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0361"/>
                        <p>In line with the instructions to take this matter up with the Ministry of
                            Foreign Affairs, the subject was discussed with Dr. Carlos L. Torriani,
                            Director of the Division of Economic and Consular Affairs, and Dr.
                            Alberto A. Bonfante, Subdirector of the same division. Both emphasized
                            that they were not in a position to give an official opinion, either
                            formally or informally, as the matter must of necessity be referred to
                            the Ministries of Agriculture and Treasury and to the Argentine Central
                            Bank. This they agreed to do by memorandum and give the Embassy a
                            definite statement later on. Neither was of the opinion that it would be
                            necessary to make the matter the subject of a formal note to the
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation, both officials raised certain positive
                            objections. They fear that the revocation of all outstanding export
                            licenses would result in harmful delay. Further, they drew the
                            distinction, from the Argentine point of view, as between controlling
                            the imports of merchandise through firms normally engaged in the
                            business and the question of obtaining necessary import requirements
                            regardless of through what channels. In other words, while they agree
                            that it would be much better to have the merchandise allowed export
                            licenses from the United States come direct to the proper firms and
                            entities, they felt that it would be definitely better for the
                            merchandise to reach Argentina through any channel than to run the risk
                            of losing any of the limited supplies which Argentina hopes to receive.
                            It was suggested that a more satisfactory solution would be for the
                            Department to submit to the Embassy in Buenos Aires a list of the
                            doubtful cases of the licenses now outstanding and to revoke only those
                            recommended for that action by the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>It was explained that the Embassy was in no position to judge whether
                            such a procedure would be feasible or not from the standpoint of the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>While definite advice as to the action preferred by the Argentine
                            Government must await further advice from the Foreign Office, it would
                            be appreciated if the Department could, in the meantime, advise as to
                            the practicability of the above suggestion. In the course of the
                            conversation it was emphasized that the United States wishes to follow
                            the course most acceptable to the Argentine.</p>

                        <p>767. With regard to Department’s willingness to ask the Board of Economic
                            Warfare to revoke all outstanding Argentine licenses issued between
                            October 10 and March 1, mentioned in Department’s cable 513, April 13, 9
                            p.m., it is quite doubtful if Argentina will approve. Officials both of
                            the Foreign Office (see strictly confidential despatch No. 4808, April
                            21) and of the Central Bank have strictly informally advised that they
                            would be afraid to make such a recommendation, first, because of
                            criticism that might ensue and second, because they fear some much
                            needed merchandise now consigned to unsatisfactory parties might,
                            through cancellation, not reach the country. They wish to know if it
                            would not be possible for the Department to supply a list of the
                            licenses outstanding, giving type of merchandise, quantity, and the name
                            of the Argentine importer. With this list they could recommend those to
                            be rejected. While the above is strictly unofficial, it is apparent that
                            this will undoubtedly be the official position taken later. Consequently
                            the Embassy would like advice as to the possibility of meeting their
                            request.</p>

                        <p>632. Your 767, April 25, 4 p.m. In view of indicated reluctance on part
                            of Foreign Office and Central Bank to recommend revocation and
                            reconsideration of outstanding licenses issued prior to March 1st, this
                            proposal may well be abandoned. As regards possibility of supplying
                            statistical record of such licenses, the Board of Economic Warfare
                            estimates that compilation could not be completed in less than a
                            month.</p>
                        <p>Since the abuses described in your 477 March 12 midnight have been
                            largely eliminated by the checking procedure effective March 24, and
                            since many of the uncertified licenses will have been consummated by
                            delivery or will have expired in the interim, it would not appear
                            practicable to attempt to furnish the data requisite for their
                            re-examination.</p>
                        <p>The appropriate Argentinian import agencies may be assured that under
                            present procedure the closest possible coordination between <pb n="351"

                            inevitable early difficulties, is fully appreciated.</p>

                        <p>I have the honor to refer to this Embassy’s confidential despatch No.
                            4000 of January 28, 1942, discussing allocation procedure, especially as
                            regards the insistence on the part of the Embassy to Central Bank
                            officials that proper control can only be exercised if the Embassy
                            approves the issuance of each Certificate, both as regards the firm or
                            entity to which it is issued and the amount of the product involved.</p>
                        <p>This system has worked with relatively complete success from the
                            beginning until recently. We now find that the Central Bank is prone to
                            issue an increasing number of Certificates without prior approval of the
                            Embassy. In some cases they subsequently ask our approval and explain
                            the case and in others no mention is made at all. In order that our
                            control might be complete, every Certificate has been carefully studied
                            and the Department has been advised as to our recommendation on every
                            Certificate issued. These recommendations have gone forward in the form
                            of despatches or reports, for example, see voluntary report No. 982 of
                            April 17, 1942,<note n="73" xml:id="d343fn73">Not printed.</note>

                            strictly confidential despatch No. 4438 of March 16, 1942, prepared by
                            Mr. J. L. Camp, Senior Economic Analyst.<note n="73" xml:id="d343fn75"
                                >Not printed.</note> By this procedure, the Embassy has made a
                            specific recommendation for every Certificate of Necessity issued by the
                            Argentine Central Bank. The bulk of the Certificates were covered in the
                            revised estimates of the Central Bank studies and in the Embassy’s
                            original recommendation for distribution of quotas. In those cases where
                            the Certificates issued have been to firms and for amounts approved in
                            those reports, no special mention of the Certificate has been made, but
                            in every other case a special reference has been provided to the
                            Department.</p>
                        <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0364"/>
                        <p>As the Department will realize, this offers a means of providing a
                            thorough and complete check, covering the distribution of every
                            allocation. At the same time, it requires a great deal of careful work,
                            as it is not the intent of the Embassy to refuse any request simply
                            because the Argentine Central Bank may have issued the Certificate
                            without prior Embassy approval. This means that each case must be
                            discussed and studied carefully, and while the Embassy prefers to
                            continue with this system, it would very much appreciate the
                            Department’s viewpoint as to the extent to which it is utilized by the
                            Board of Economic Warfare in approving or disapproving export license
                            applications. Likewise, except from the standpoint of scarcity, it would
                            be helpful for the Embassy to know the degree to which its
                            recommendations are accepted by the Board. If, except for scarcity of a
                            product, the Embassy recommendations are generally accepted in making
                            final decisions, unless later additional information is available in
                            Washington, the system will be continued. If the Board of Economic
                            Warfare does not utilize these reports or find them sufficiently useful
                            to warrant their continuance, the system will be dropped.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy feels that it would be much more practicable to apply the
                            greatest element of control possible here in Argentina and thus relieve
                            the Board of Economic Warfare in Washington of the necessity of passing
                            on the relative merits of each individual case. Always, the exception
                            must be made as regards scarcity of the product concerned, as only the
                            Board can be in a position to determine that point. However, the Embassy
                            has certain advantages. It is limited in its work to the requirements of
                            only one country. Staff members engaged in this work, with few
                            exceptions, range from four to twelve years experience in Argentina. The
                            advice and assistance of business men, whose knowledge of this market is
                            still greater, is also utilized. This makes possible the relatively
                            rapid separation of the desirable from the undesirable consignees or
                            purchasers.</p>
                        <p>This is one of the primary reasons why it is believed that a system
                            requiring the issuance of a Certificate of Necessity for all products,
                            whether allocated or not, would be preferable.</p>

                        <p>The Embassy believes that the combined system of reviewing Special
                            Committee export license recommendations established by Department’s
                            instruction No. 2161 of April 14, 1942, and the WT reports initiated by
                            the Department’s strictly confidential telegram No. 586 of April 27, 3
                                p.m.,<note n="77" xml:id="d343fn77">Not printed.</note> will do much
                            to eliminate the speculator and cloak <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353"
                                facs="0365"/>from future trade with the United States. It is
                            regretted, however, that in the first case, approvals cannot be withheld
                            pending Embassy advices. It is also hoped that the Board of Economic
                            Warfare has been able to revoke the licenses in the 247 cases
                            recommended by the Embassy covering the lists of applications reviewed
                            by the Special Committee from March 24 through April 16, 1942. The
                            efficacy of this system is apparent when it will be noted that these 247
                            cases represent approximately 17% of the total number recommended by the
                            Committee for approval.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty anticipated by the Embassy on the WT inquiries is that
                            seldom will we be able to make the “three” recommendation, simply
                            because it is common practice for nearly all firms to attempt entering
                            fields where they have not heretofore been engaged. In any case, this
                            combined procedure should do much to eliminate numerous cloaks and to
                            retain trade in normal channels, at least during the transition period
                            prior to the establishment of the system requiring the Certificate of
                            Necessity for all products, provided always that the Department and the
                            Board of Economic Warfare decide to adopt such a system.</p>
                        <p>The viewpoint of the Department on the points mentioned above would be
                            greatly appreciated.</p>

                            proposed revocation of outstanding export licenses, it does not appear
                            feasible to submit a list of doubtful licenses now outstanding to our
                            missions in Argentina. Such a step would involve reviewing thousands of
                            outstanding licenses. The Department has been furnishing the Embassy
                            with lists of all applications granted subsequent to March 24, and upon
                            the mission’s request, all licenses to which they objected have been
                            revoked. I believe we are faced with the necessity of letting <pb
                                n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0366"/>those licenses go which are
                            outstanding, hoping that the new procedure which is now in effect will
                            prove satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>I should think that in reply to Mr. Armour’s letter, it will be desirable
                            to point out the procedure now followed by the Board and the Department,
                            i.e. transmitting abstracts of the licenses issued in order that the
                            Embassy’s approval may be obtained. I realize that this action is taken
                            after a license has been issued, but I do not believe that there is any
                            other method which could be instituted which would meet the present
                            situation unless, of course, there is a white list established, and from
                            Mr. Armour’s letter I take it he is opposed to such a list.</p>
                        <p>I will send you Colonel Lord’s comments on Mr. Armour’s letter when they
                            have been received.</p>

                            regarding the extent to which the Department and the B.E.W. find it
                            possible to consider and follow Embassy recommendations on allocations
                            and export licenses. This was recently covered in part by Confidential
                            Despatch No. 4954 of May 5, 1942. However, the list of the export
                            applications reviewed by the Special Committee, the WT inquiries, and
                            information received by local firms of rejections in Washington of
                            Certificates of Necessity, lead me to believe that the condition
                            discussed in Embassy cable 477<note n="82" xml:id="d345fn82">Dated March
                                12, midnight, <ref target="#pg_329">p. 329</ref>.</note> still
                            exists. I feel that I should emphasize that this practice is having an
                            increasingly detrimental effect and has reached the point at which not
                            only local business men but actually Argentine Government officials
                            openly express the feeling that the Certificate of Necessity is of
                            little if any value. At the same time, from the lists of export license
                            applications reviewed by the Special Committee, approvals are noted of
                            license applications which this Embassy recommends should be revoked for
                            reasons ranging from the fact that the merchandise is outside the normal
                            business of the Argentine importer to that in which the importer has
                            actually been recommended for the Proclaimed List. I know you appreciate
                            fully how this limits the effectiveness of the Embassy in the exercise
                            of its control. A case which I believe to be of vital importance is
                            found in the informal approach yesterday made by officials of the
                            Central Bank regarding the distribution <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355"
                                facs="0367"/>of the second quarter allocations of iron and steel and
                            of plastics. Their position is that owing to the limited amount of the
                            quotas, they feel that it will all have to be given to Government
                            entities, as they are of first consideration. Obviously, this would
                            produce the exact opposite of the desirable results commented upon in
                            your personal letter of March 27,<note n="83" xml:id="d345fn83">Not
                                printed.</note> and the position now taken may be of definite
                            political significance, as up to now, Central Bank officials have agreed
                            completely with members of the Embassy staff to the effect that the
                            maintenance of operations on any kind of an economic basis by Argentine
                            private industry, both small and large, was of greater collective
                            importance to the economy of the country than most Government
                            construction or similar projects. I feel that under present conditions
                            the Embassy is handicapped in combatting effectively the proposed
                            distribution to Government entities. Were it possible to employ our
                            recommendations, especially as regards Certificates of Necessity, we
                            could logically take the position that allocations could not be made to
                            Government departments, but only to the individual firms holding
                            Government contracts for essential works. However, Certificates of
                            Necessity for at least some of the few cases we have recommended of that
                            nature have been rejected.</p>
                        <p>I note that <hi rend="italic">Current Controls Bulletin</hi> No. 20,
                            forwarded with the Department’s instruction No. 2308, of May 7,
                                1942,<note n="83" xml:id="d345fn84">Not printed.</note> states that
                            Certificates of Necessity will be followed except when interests of
                            national defense dictate the contrary and further, that applications for
                            export licenses of allocated materials unaccompanied by the Certificate
                            of Necessity will be returned without action other than in exceptional
                            cases. Perhaps it has not yet been possible to place this procedure in
                            practice, as on some occasions licenses are granted for allocated
                            materials in quantities greater than the total allocation made to
                            Argentina, and for uses for which both the Argentine Government and this
                            Embassy understood would be unacceptable. As an example, I refer to the
                            case of cellulose acetate, discussed under application No. 2376,
                            reviewed by the Special Committee April 13 and reported on fully and
                            recommended for revocation by Embassy cable 804, May 1, 12 noon.<note

                            3633, for bakelite molding powder reviewed on April 30. This company is
                            believed to have stocks for more than two years of normal operations.
                            They would not be eligible for any quota allocation. The amount of the
                            powder for which export license was approved would also be sufficient
                            for another two years normal operations. Similar cases seem to have
                            occurred in <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0368"/>formaldehyde, other
                            plastic materials, iron and steel, caustic soda and tanning materials. I
                            particularly refer, for example, to pipe for YPF<note n="86"
                                xml:id="d345fn86">Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales.</note>
                            mentioned in Embassy cable 871, May 9, 2 p.m.<note n="87"
                                xml:id="d345fn87">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>I feel that I must also report the increasing expression on the part of
                            local business people of the belief that so many inconsistencies can
                            hardly be explained by other reasons than plain graft and I regret to
                            state that this accusation is being increasingly made as regards
                            obtaining export licenses. One man who has recently returned from
                            Washington admits that he obtained numerous licenses using fictitious
                            Argentine consignees, subsequently shipping the merchandise to order and
                            receiving it here himself for sale to other people. On at least one
                            other occasion, one person has advised us that he has duplicated his
                            application for export license on the theory that probably one would be
                            granted. Both were. Five cases have been called to our attention where
                            the firms in the United States requested export licenses for materials
                            which have never been ordered by the reported consignee. The duplicate
                            applications appearing in the lists reviewed by the Special Committee
                            suggests that this practice may be rather common.</p>
                        <p>I fully realize that the magnitude of the problem in Washington makes
                            some confusion inevitable. Also, we appreciate that the WT inquiries now
                            in effect should help considerably. However, I feel that many mistakes
                            could be avoided by adopting the system outlined in my letter to you of
                            April 16, 1942. The Central Bank has recently informed us that they
                            would not only approve this system but that in its application they
                            would use a Committee upon which the Ministries of Agriculture, Treasury
                            and Foreign Relations are represented. They are already preparing “use”
                            priority schedules for certain products and would, I feel, be inclined
                            to accept the major part of our recommendations in that regard. To
                            require Embassy recommendation for all export license, both for
                            allocated and unallocated products, with the further understanding that
                            these recommendations would be considered and under ordinary
                            circumstances accepted in Washington for other than questions of supply
                            and use, would, I realize, require the Embassy to accept some of the
                            responsibility now assumed by the BEW. However, I feel that the Embassy
                            staff, being on the ground, is in a good position to perform that duty
                            effectively for the BEW, and I hope that early action will be possible
                            which will embody this or some other more satisfactory system.</p>

                                Buenos Aires That Present Controls Are Unsatisfactory</hi></p>
                        <p>Reference is made to Mr. Meltzer’s letter of April 3 to Mr. Acheson and
                            Mr. Armour’s letter to Mr. Welles of April 16 regarding what appears to
                            be an unsatisfactory control procedure on the part of the export control
                            authorities in that imported commodities are still reaching undesirable
                            firms. Several suggestions are made whereby this situation can be met.
                            In this connection I should like to set forth the steps that have been
                            taken to remedy the situation, and to give my views on the matter.</p>
                        <p>The following are the forms of control procedure which were placed in
                            effect in March and April and which, it is believed, will in part meet
                            the situation:</p>
                        <p>1. A list of all applications approved and rejected by the
                            Reviews-Appeals Committee giving full information as to the material
                            involved, consignee, and purchaser, and action taken on the particular
                            applications is daily airmailed to the Embassy. The Embassy has been
                            advised to notify the Department immediately if it disapproves the
                            granting of any of the licenses. When the Department receives word to
                            this effect from the Embassy it informs the BEW, which has agreed to
                            revoke the licenses.</p>
                        <p>The Reviews–Appeals Committee considers all Argentine applications with a
                            value of $500 or over and all applications to export chemical products
                            with a value of $100. I am advised that this amounts to about eighty per
                            cent of all applications received. Although this only gives the Embassy
                            a check after the licenses have been issued, the shipment can be
                            prevented by the ready revocation of the license. (This procedure was
                            worked out as a compromise after the BEW refused to hold all
                            applications pending clearance with the Embassy).</p>
                        <p>2. In order to check cloaking operations on shipments to Argentina, the
                            World Trade Intelligence Division, in cooperation with the BEW, has
                            arranged to regularly telegraph to the Embassy lists of export license
                            applications on which action has been suspended by the BEW because the
                            consignee is unknown here or the transaction appears questionable.</p>
                        <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0370"/>
                        <p>This form of control should in a large part affect cloaking operations
                            which exist as the result of new firms being established in Argentina.
                            In this way, the Embassy is given an opportunity to check on all cases
                            in which the name of the consignee is unknown to the BEW or WT.</p>
                        <p>3. Embassy review of Certificates of Necessity in effect provides control
                            by the mission of the issuance of licenses for the export of allocated
                            materials.</p>
                        <p>A copy of all Certificates of Necessity issued by the Central Bank are
                            sent to the Embassy. If the Embassy disapproves an order, it can either
                            get the Bank to revoke it or notify the Department that the license
                            should not be issued.</p>
                        <p>These new measures of control plus the implementation of the Argentine
                            policy in general should in large part meet the objections of the
                            Embassy. A means of complete control over every single shipment has not
                            yet been found practicable. For example, the Embassy first requested
                            that it be allowed to advise on all applications. The BEW pointed out
                            that it was impossible to hold up shipments until the Embassy had
                            investigated and approved each application, but agreed to the procedure
                            outlined above. The BEW recommended that the Embassy make up a White
                            List but this proposal was turned down by the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy was further consulted on the question of calling in for
                            revalidation all outstanding licenses issued to Argentina with a view to
                            revoking those which the Embassy disapproved of; however, the Embassy
                            turned down this suggestion as it would obviously be a discriminatory
                            act.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the suggested measures of control set forth on page 2 of Mr.
                            Meltzer’s letter to Mr. Acheson, these have all been considered and are
                            either being carried out or have been found impracticable. As to
                            suggestion (1) that specific licenses be required for all articles, it
                            should be pointed out that general licenses are rapidly being cancelled
                            and that it would be most discriminatory to require individual licenses
                            for Argentina when not requiring them for the other republics. Proposal
                            (2) that all applications be cleared with the Embassy was found to be
                            impracticable by the BEW. Suggestion (3) that cases involving consignees
                            considered questionable be checked with the Embassy is now in effect.
                            Proposal (4) to furnish copies of the confidential list to collectors is
                            not in effect but if it were it would only have the value of stopping
                            the small amount of material such as foodstuffs going out under general
                            license. All individual applications are checked by the BEW against the
                            confidential list.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Armour’s proposal that all orders for imports be covered by
                            Certificates of Necessity bears merit in that it could indeed give the
                            Embassy control at its end. Possibly this is the only means available
                                <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0371"/>of obtaining the complete
                            control desired by the Embassy. Before it is attempted the present means
                            of control now functioning should be fully explained to the Embassy, and
                            a further report from it should be received as to whether it is
                            satisfactory.</p>

                        <p>1115. Department’s instruction of May 15<note n="89" xml:id="d347fn89"
                                >Not printed.</note> calling for reports on Argentine essential
                            requirements for 1943 of 173 products or groups of products. Iron and
                            steel report is required by July 18 and others by September 1st. The
                            Department is aware that the Argentine Government, through the Central
                            Bank, has cooperated in the preparation of all requirements reports and
                            its further cooperation is essential in this undertaking. However, I
                            feel that this is not an appropriate time to ask the Argentine
                            Government to collaborate in the preparation of the number and type of
                            reports called for by these instructions. For several months the
                            Argentine Central Bank has employed a minimum of 30 to 40 people, on
                            requirements studies requested by our Government. To date they have
                            prepared 46 reports. Unfortunately, export licenses for Argentina have
                            not been granted on the basis, either of their recommendation or of
                            those of the Embassy nor have their certificates of necessity brought
                            anticipated results. Consequently to ask the Argentine Government for
                            these additional reports could not be other than embarrassing. Moreover,
                            I feel that the entire problem is complicated by reason of the necessity
                            of considering the ultimate use as of primary importance. I realize that
                            this cannot be avoided. However, the principal criteria for end-use of
                            any given material seem to be (1) contribution to the <pb n="360"
                                xml:id="pg_360" facs="0372"/>war effort and, (2) effect upon the
                            national economy of the importing country. For practical purposes I feel
                            that with very few exceptions, for example tungsten mining and possibly
                            some of the work of the <hi rend="italic">frigoríficos</hi>, Argentina
                            makes no contribution to the war effort. This leaves national economy as
                            the basic consideration. While realizing that to allow the exportation
                            of material from the United States to Argentina for a use prohibited in
                            the United States carries both substantial political and economic
                            considerations, I feel that the fundamental differences, particularly
                            now, of the economies of the two countries must not be disregarded.</p>
                        <p>If it were possible for the United States to let the Argentine Government
                            exercise that control, subject only to general limitations, which I feel
                            it would be glad to meet, the import requirements studies would be
                            simple, accurate and practicable. Once the requirements were estimated
                            and allocation made, control of allocation would still be exercised both
                            as regards the Proclaimed List or suspect consignees, and as regards any
                            preference which might be given to local entities such as Caporypf.</p>
                        <p>I realize that this suggestion requires a determination of policy, but I
                            feel very strongly that this should be taken now rather than to continue
                            as at present. Our further insistence upon detailed statistical studies,
                            followed by unsatisfactory results, is increasingly irritating to the
                            Argentine Government and, I might add, to the Argentine people. In fact
                            I believe that if the Department feels that no consideration can now be
                            given to making the Argentine Government primarily responsible for
                            use-distribution of allocated materials, it would be better if the
                            entire allocation system were abandoned for Argentina and if every order
                            were simply made subject to individual export license, with the
                            understanding that Embassy’s approval would be obtained for other than
                            supply and use factors. While this system would not be entirely
                            unsatisfactory, it should at least serve a dual purpose. Argentina would
                            be made to realize that hers is a particular case as compared with other
                            hemisphere countries, and the United States could not be accused of not
                            attempting to fulfill implied obligations.</p>

                            no. 4954 of May 5, 1942 concerning procedure under Certificates of
                            Necessity issued by the Central Bank, particularly as regards <pb
                                n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0373"/>the extent to which the
                            Embassy’s recommendations are followed at the Board of Economic Warfare
                            in approving or disapproving export license applications supported by
                            such certificates, and informs the Ambassador that his recommendations
                            are followed in practically every case. There have been some very few
                            exceptions, but the Embassy’s observations are of such definite value
                            that the Department desires the Embassy to continue to make
                            recommendations with regard to export license applications forwarded by
                            the World Trade Division of the Department, and decisions of the
                            Argentine section of the Reviews and Appeals Committee of the Office of
                            Exports.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State further desires to inform the Ambassador that
                            orders were duly issued by the competent authority of the Board to
                            revoke the licenses referred to in the Embassy’s telegrams concerning
                            cases acted on by the Special Argentine Committee between March 24 and
                            April 16.</p>
                        <p>The Committee has raised a special point in connection with those cases
                            in which the Embassy recommended disapproval on the grounds that the
                            import is outside of the normal activities of the consignee. In certain
                            of such cases it has developed that the World Trade Intelligence
                            Division has very favorable reports concerning the consignees and the
                            feeling of the Argentine Committee is that the single fact of the import
                            not being “usual” is not a very substantial reason for denying such firm
                            the small amounts of material requested. In this connection, the
                            Committee feels that it is rather logical to assume that many reputable
                            firms, owing to the difficulty of importing customary lines, are
                            branching out into new lines. The Department is inclined to be of the
                            same opinion as the Committee, although the comment of the Embassy is
                            urgently desired in this respect. If the Embassy insists that the fact
                            of a firm importing new lines is sufficient to warrant disapproval of
                            the application, the Department will again inform the Committee in this
                            regard.</p>

                            embarrassing to the Embassy to ask the Argentine Government at this time
                            to collaborate in the preparation of the essential requirements reports
                            for 1943. However, the Department requires the data requested, and it is
                            hoped that the Embassy will obtain the effective cooperation of the
                            American business community in preparing the desired reports.</p>

                                and Christian M. Ravndal, Assistant Chief and Chief, respectively,
                                of the American Hemisphere Exports Office.</note> It seems apparent
                            that existing export control procedure cannot be effectively integrated
                            having regard to supply and shipping problems, and consideration must be
                            given to alternates. Recent telegrams from missions reporting
                            requirements for shipping purposes indicate a definite pattern of import
                            requirements within broad categories leaving only 15 to 20 percent
                            undetermined. The implementation of these expressed needs is complicated
                            by the inability of Export Control to furnish data by commodity on
                            approved licenses and even if this information were available it is
                            improbable that the approved licenses would correspond with the desired
                            pattern and our best efforts would prove futile. The difficulty with
                            present procedure is that applications are filed at unrelated times by
                            individual exporters and not according to a preconceived program. If
                            each of the American republics in cooperation with missions would
                            present a total import requirement for say one full quarter, such total
                            being the composite of all individual applications for the quarter,
                            Export Control could consider each application as a component part of
                            this global requirement and thus minimize present confusion. Would you
                            consider and discuss the following alternative plan: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Importers would submit to a control entity minimum
                                    requirements for the next quarter. For example, by July 1 the
                                    importers would have made known their individual total import
                                    requirements for the period October 1 to December 31.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>These requirements would be checked and certified by the
                                    control entity.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Present form certificates of necessity would be issued for
                                    allocated commodities and, so as to avoid confusion, a different
                                    form certificate for unallocated commodities. Importer would
                                    send certificate to exporter for attachment to export license
                                    application as at present. However, copies of all certificates
                                    would be sent in one batch by the Embassy through the Department
                                    to the Office of Exports of the <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363"

                                    enabling BEW and WPB to determine in advance the quantities by
                                    commodity for which production and shipping must be
                                    provided.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The Embassy would check the importer’s requirements, and
                                    screen for desirability of consignee, end use, et cetera.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>The control entity and the Embassy would indicate the shipping
                                    priority desired on each certificate for guidance in the
                                    distribution of available cargo space.</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>Projects would not be included under this plan. Allocations
                                    would continue to be used for the guidance of foreign control
                                    entity and missions and by means of these allocations BEW and
                                    WPB could retain overall control on the distribution of
                                    materials in short supply. This alternate program appears to
                                    present a more realistic approach to positive economic warfare,
                                    since it contemplates the establishment of a quarterly import
                                    requirement that would be known in advance and against which
                                    positive production and shipping programs could be worked out.
                                    Would appreciate your reaction using Argentina as an example. To
                                    what extent would additional staff be required? [Christian

                        <p>1318. For Ravndal from Ravndal. Department’s 974, June 30, 7 p.m. I have
                            discussed your alternative plan with officials of the Central Bank,
                            Colonel Lord, the Embassy and representative American businessmen and
                            there is unanimous agreement that it offers a practical solution.</p>
                        <p>The only modification suggested is that the period should be one of 6
                            months rather than 3. It is felt here that production and shipping could
                            be more readily coordinated over the longer period.</p>
                        <p>The Central Bank is prepared to ascertain and advise us before October 1
                            what will be Argentina’s import requirements for the first allocation
                            period of 1943. The estimate will be based upon a monthly United States
                            shipping allocation of 14,000 tons of cargo space plus whatever
                            additional tonnage may be expected from Argentine vessels. If this
                            should not be regarded as a reasonable basis the bank should be promptly
                            informed.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the United States Government receives Argentina’s estimated
                            import requirements it will communicate to the Central Bank the
                            quantities of allocated products and the probable quantities <pb n="364"
                                xml:id="pg_364" facs="0376"/>of unallocated commodities in short
                            supply which could be supplied to Argentina. (The Argentine Government
                            would not wish to reserve shipping space for a commodity which cannot be
                            furnished by the United States.) On this basis the bank will undertake
                            to issue certificates covering all import requirements from the United
                            States for the first 6 months of 1943. Every effort will be made to
                            issue all such certificates during the month of October. Copies will be
                            furnished to the Embassy for the information of Washington. The date
                            upon which the certificate can be issued, however, depends in part upon
                            the date when the above advice regarding quantities of products
                            available is received.</p>
                        <p>The Central Bank agrees that the United States Government cannot and will
                            not tolerate any distribution which would permit our merchandise to
                            reach the enemy. It will in all cases consult with the Embassy before
                            issuing a Certificate of Necessity. When it cannot escape issuing a
                            certificate to a firm on the Proclaimed or Confidential List it will
                            advise the Embassy in the expectation that the certificate will be
                            dishonored.</p>
                        <p>In view of the need for elasticity in shipping priority from the United
                            States due to possible sinkings of counted goods from Great Britain the
                            Central Bank would prefer not to indicate shipping priority on each
                            certificate. It has prepared a breakdown by commodities of Argentina’s
                            import requirements under various tonnages of shipping space and
                            requests that this breakdown plus the advice of its representative in
                            Washington be followed by Port Cargo Clearance Committee in loading
                            vessels for this country.</p>
                        <p>During July and August merchandise should be allowed despatch to
                            Argentina under existing regulations. Effective September 1, however, no
                            United States goods of any description whether allocated or unallocated
                            should be permitted export to Argentina unless covered by a new
                            certificate showing clearly that the shipment has been reviewed and has
                            the support of the Central Bank. The purpose of waiting until September
                            1 to institute the new system is to give the Central Bank time to obtain
                            from importers in Argentina full information as to the nature,
                            whereabouts, and condition of manufacture of the goods that have been
                            ordered whether or not covered by an export license and or Certificate
                            of Necessity. Since the factor of merchandise supply of Argentina is in
                            many cases more important than the question of acceptable consignee the
                            Central Bank would like as much as possible of the goods which are now
                            in ports to come forward. By September 1, however, the Central Bank will
                            have examined all outstanding orders and will be able to designate which
                            commodities both allocated and unallocated should be loaded so as most
                            efficiently to make use of available shipping space. <pb n="365"
                                xml:id="pg_365" facs="0377"/>In case it should be desirable from the
                            supply standpoint to let merchandise come forward which is now at the
                            ports in the hands of firms not eligible to receive corresponding
                            certificates the Argentine Government will name an acceptable consignee
                            or will requisition the goods upon arrival for further distribution. In
                            this latter case the Argentine Government will take into consideration
                            the wishes of the United States Government to the effect that the
                            distribution be made only to firms and entities who have access to the
                            United States market.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing represents the opinion of officials of the Central Bank
                            with whom the problem has been discussed and should not be construed as
                            already having been formally approved by the Argentine Government.</p>
                        <p>The personnel needs will be discussed in a separate telegram. [Olaf

                            American firms and Argentine industries such as the meat packers which
                            contribute to the United Nations’ war effort, but not to an extent of
                            jeopardizing our own supply. As a result licenses approved for Argentina
                            have decreased from $11,332,652 in January to $5,975,876 in July.</p>

                            Actual shipments of critical materials have been less than the reduced
                            allocations. This has been effected not only through restrictions on
                            licensing but also through restrictions on priority ratings at WPB. In
                            the case of iron and steel, for example, Argentina’s half rations for
                            July were 13,533 tons, but according to preliminary reports obtained by
                            the Maritime Commission from various sources at the ports, only 1,486
                            tons were shipped in that month. For August the allocation was also
                            13,533 tons; shipments to August 20, 1,883 tons.</p>

                            Iron and steel supply is Argentina’s vital weakness in the absence of
                            any source other than the United States which might ship in sizable
                            quantities.</p>
                        <p>Since the beginning of this year there has been a marked increase in
                            Argentina’s imports of these products from Spain and it appears that
                            Spain has undertaken specifically, as one of the conditions of the
                            Spanish-Argentine trade agreement to furnish 30,000 tons of iron and
                            steel in the first year.</p>
                        <p>Argentina’s requests for iron and steel in 1943 total 385,000 tons. Our
                            Embassy regards 93,000 tons as the indispensable minimum requirement.
                            Argentine expects to get 30,000 tons from Spain and small quantities
                            from Sweden and Brazil. Presumably, then, we could cut our share in
                            Argentina’s supply to 60,000 tons, or to 5,000 tons a month as against
                            13,000 tons a month in the present quarter.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Collado</hi>: With reference to the question
                            raised in your memorandum of October 27<note n="94" xml:id="d354fn94"
                                >Not printed.</note> regarding the implementation of our policy
                            towards Argentina, it may be explained that allocations for Argentina
                            are determined on the basis of parity with other American republics.
                            After approval of the proposed allocations by the American Requirements
                            Committee in the past AE,<note n="95" xml:id="d354fn95">American
                                Hemisphere Exports Office.</note> in consultation with a member of
                            the Requirements Branch of BEW, has arbitrarily reduced Argentine
                            allocations by 50 percent. However, as you will recall, beginning with
                            the fourth quarter the iron and steel allocation for Argentina was <pb
                                n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0381"/>sharply reduced to
                            approximately 5,000 tons monthly. Because of the very small tonnage
                            involved (1,427 tons) and the fact that a 50 percent reduction would
                            seriously cripple industries employing a relatively large number of
                            workers, the Embassy was instructed to use its judgment in making any
                            reductions in allocations of commodities other than iron and steel and
                            report to the Department the action taken.</p>
                        <p>For example, in determining the acetone allocation, supplies were almost
                            restricted to the rayon industry and an arbitrary cut of 50 percent
                            would be reflected in a corresponding curtailment of the operations of
                            the industry. It was therefore felt that Mr. Armour would be in a better
                            position to evaluate the implications of any reduction that might be
                            made. Likewise, a reduction in the allocation of chromium chemicals
                            which are used largely for tanning leather would bring about a
                            curtailment of activities in that industry and it was felt that the
                            Embassy would be better qualified to determine the extent to which such
                            a curtailment would be advisable.</p>

                            Government departments and [<hi rend="italic">as</hi>] such announcement
                            might be considered discriminatory. The Central Bank could issue
                            Certificates of Necessity to Government department, Embassy would
                            recommend rejection to Board of Economic Warfare who would refuse to
                            issue export license, Embassy would be advised of such action by cable
                            and the Central Bank, on receiving such advice from Embassy would
                            redistribute material to commercial entities. Government departments
                            thus would be gradually reconciled to their inability to obtain
                            materials.</p>

                                of Necessity provides for all consumers and importers receiving
                                proportion of 1941 consumption or imports. With an allocation of
                                14,088 short tons thousands of firms will be issued Certificates of
                                Necessity for insignificant amounts of material. Central Bank
                                requires formal statement from Embassy as to steel mill

                            military and naval matériel by Argentina in the United States. The
                            Ambassador stated that so far neither the War nor Navy Department had
                            given the Argentine delegation any idea of delivery dates. The Argentine
                            Military and Naval Commission here, of course, appreciates the heavy
                            demands for military and naval matériel and, in order that the
                            Government in Buenos Aires may understand, is sending two officers by
                            plane to Buenos Aires.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that I called this morning on the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs,
                            Dr. Rothe. <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0386"/>This was the first
                            occasion I have had to see Dr. Rothe since my two day visit to Rio de
                            Janeiro, and we naturally discussed the conference.<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d359fn8">The Third Meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the
                                American Republics held at Rio de Janeiro, January 15–28, 1942; for
                                correspondence, see <ref target="#pg_6">pp. 6</ref> ff.</note></p>
                        <p>I was disappointed, if not surprised, to find that the events that had
                            transpired at Rio de Janeiro since I had last seen him did not appear to
                            have changed his position or sentiments. He continued to put forth the
                            argument that Argentina in not having broken diplomatic relations with
                            the Axis Powers was in a better position to assist the United States
                            through the exporting of essential materials to us without the attendant
                            risk of having their ships sunk. I pointed out that although relations
                            between the United States and the Axis Powers had not been broken prior
                            to December, this had not prevented Germany from sinking United States
                            vessels. Dr. Rothe admitted this, but insisted that if any attacks were
                            made against Argentine vessels, this would of course lead immediately to
                            a break in relations or declaration of war on their part. He then went
                            on to develop his time-worn argument that Argentina was not in a
                            position to defend itself against attack: that a break in relations
                            would inevitably lead to war and that his Government felt a sense of
                            responsibility to the people not to put themselves in this vulnerable
                            position until they had material to defend themselves. These he said
                            they hoped to obtain from the United States.</p>
                        <p>I told Dr. Rothe that he must of course realize that the situation had
                            changed materially since the Rio de Janeiro Conference: that as I had
                            pointed out to him in previous conversations, following their own line
                            of argument that if ruptured relations submitted a nation to the danger
                            of attack, those nations which had taken the step must be the ones first
                            served and that we would make every effort to see that they received
                            such materials as they required. I expressed the opinion that this
                            argument applied not only to war materials, but also to other strategic
                            materials, of which there was a growing scarcity in the United States;
                            that where the people of the United States were making great sacrifices
                            to go without such articles but were willing to see such materials
                            supplied to countries which had taken a definite stand with the United
                            States and the democracies, public opinion would certainly not favor
                            having such materials sent to countries which had not made clear their
                            position of solidarity with us. He appeared to admit the logic of these
                            arguments but again reverted to the position in which Argentina found
                            itself and insisted that aside from other considerations, owing to the
                            internal situation it would be impossible for the Government to break
                            relations <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0387"/>with the Axis Powers
                            at the present time. In any case, they would have to await the regular
                            session of Congress in May, but in the meantime they would of course
                            carry out scrupulously the commitments taken at Rio de Janeiro.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to the Minister that nineteen countries having already
                            severed relations, with the probability that Chile would take similar
                            action following the elections next Sunday, this would, I felt, put his
                            country in a very difficult position. As the only country maintaining
                            relations with the Axis it was obvious that the latter countries would
                            concentrate their activities in Argentina, using it as a focal point
                            from which to conduct their subversive activities not only within the
                            country itself but throughout Latin America. While I had no doubt that
                            Argentina would endeavor scrupulously to carry out the commitments taken
                            at Rio de Janeiro with regard to suppressing Axis propaganda, subversive
                            activities, etc., I felt sure he would agree that this would be far more
                            difficult for them than for those countries which had already severed
                            relations with the Axis.</p>
                        <p>I also called Dr. Rothe’s attention to the interview published in <hi
                                rend="italic">Noticias Grdáficas</hi> some days ago attributing to
                            the Acting President<note n="9" xml:id="d359fn9">Ramón Castillo.</note>
                            statements to the effect that Argentina’s position had not changed and
                            that the Government would take no pre-belligerent action such as
                            breaking relations with the Axis Powers. I said that if the Acting
                            President was correctly reported, his statement would seem to be
                            inconsistent with the formula which they themselves had submitted and
                            which had been approved by the twenty-one governments at Rio de Janeiro
                            recommending a rupture of relations with the Axis.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Rothe parried by saying that the Acting President had perhaps been
                            incorrectly reported.</p>
                        <p>I shall take the first opportunity to see the Argentine Foreign Minister,
                            Dr. Ruiz Guiñazú, after his return, but in the meantime it seemed
                            advisable to lose no time in bringing home to the Acting Foreign
                            Minister certain salient truths which I was happy to find during my
                            visit to Rio de Janeiro in conversations with the Under Secretary and
                            other members of our delegation represented their views and which, after
                            their return to the Department, will, I presume, be issued in the form
                            of definite instructions as to the policy to be followed here until such
                            time as the Argentine Government may decide to alter its present
                            course.</p>

                        <p>201. For Under Secretary. Minister of Marine<note n="10"
                                xml:id="d360fn10">Adm. Mario Fincati.</note> informed me yesterday
                            he is much encouraged with progress of negotiations of Argentine
                            Military Naval Commission now in United States. Minister of War<note
                                n="11" xml:id="d360fn11">Gen. Juan N. Tonazzi.</note> also informed
                            me that two officers of the mission are now here discussing question and
                            intend to return shortly to Washington.</p>
                        <p>In view of policy outlined by you in conversations at Rio with which as
                            you know I am heartily in accord—in fact my visit to Rio was for the
                            purpose of recommending such policy—I hope the occasion will be taken to
                            implement it as soon as possible. In my talk with Minister of War and
                            Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs I have already made it clear that
                            American countries which have already declared war against or broken
                            relations with Axis Powers will be first to receive available war
                            material but I think you will agree this would have more effect if
                            coming from Washington either through Argentine Ambassador or General
                            Lapez and Admiral Sueyro. (Of course you have already made this clear in
                            your talks with Ruiz Guiñazú of [<hi rend="italic">at</hi>] Rio.</p>
                        <p>My understanding is that any loan to Argentina is out of the question for
                            the present; also that requests for priority on essential materials will
                            not receive support of State Department.</p>
                        <p>So far as over-all purchasing program is concerned I feel that for the
                            present at least no further steps should be taken to consummate
                            agreement (announcement would presumably be misinterpreted in United
                            States and also weaken our position here). This would not necessarily
                            mean that private buying here of products we require would not continue
                            although I gathered from conversations in Rio that efforts would be made
                            to increase purchases in Brazil, Uruguay and other countries of such
                            products as are available there. Williams<note n="12" xml:id="d360fn12"

                            with impression that negotiations on purchase program for which he had
                            secured favorable terms in Washington should be continued but on my
                            advice he has held negotiations in abeyance pending further
                            instructions.</p>
                        <p>At your convenience I should appreciate word as to whether my
                            understanding as set forth above represents policy we intend to
                            pursue.</p>

                        <p>151. From the Under Secretary. Your 201, February 3, 6 p.m. The outline
                            of policy contained in your telegram is entirely accurate and completely
                            in accord with the policy which this Government will pursue until and
                            unless the position assumed by the Argentine Government changes.</p>
                        <p>I have consulted General Marshall<note n="13" xml:id="d361fn13">Gen.
                                George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff, United States Army.</note> and
                            Admiral Stark. They will tomorrow inform Admiral Sueyro and General
                            Lapez that inasmuch as the Argentine Government has determined to
                            maintain at least for the time being a position which is tantamount to
                            neutrality and inasmuch as all but one of the other American Republics
                            have either declared war or broken relations with the Axis powers and
                            have thereby incurred the dangers inherent in such action through their
                            support of the United States, the military and naval matériel which can
                            be spared by the United States can logically only be allotted to the
                            latter American nations.</p>
                        <p>I have already had a preliminary conference with Espil to whom I have
                            given preliminary notification that this would be the policy pursued by
                            this Government. [Welles.]</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Welles</hi>: With regard to Mr. Armour’s
                            telegram no. 201, the following information is of some interest. Early
                            in January, Captain Spears<note n="14" xml:id="d362fn14">Capt. W. O.
                                Spears of the War Plans Division, Navy Department.</note> sent me
                            the attached extracts from the Argentine Naval Plan<note n="15"
                                xml:id="d362fn15">Not attached to file copy.</note> which was
                            submitted by the Argentine Delegation to the United States Delegation.
                            The plan itself goes far beyond any indication heretofore received from
                            the Argentine Government of its willingness to cooperate. The Argentine
                            Delegation, however, has made it abundantly clear that the plan cannot
                            be put into effect until we furnish them with the necessary matériel to
                            make it effective. The matériel stipulated as necessary is far beyond
                            any possibilities of delivery in the foreseeable future.</p>
                        <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0390"/>
                        <p>Captain Spears advises that the Argentines have been given a drastically
                            curtailed list of matériel that could be made available. I understand
                            that practically nothing could be made available if, indeed, anything
                            could be made immediately available. Upon presentation of this list the
                            Argentine Commission put on an act to the effect that it was not being
                            taken seriously. Later the Commission calmed down as its members began
                            to realize that the demands for matériel on the United States were
                            extremely heavy.</p>
                        <p>Several days ago Ambassador Espil told me that two members of the
                            Commission were flying back to Buenos Aires to explain the results of
                            the conversations thus far.</p>
                        <p>It would therefore seem desirable for the United States members
                            negotiating with the Argentine Delegation to be appropriately advised of
                            our policy with regard to the delivery to Argentina of military
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Espil also permitted me to read hastily a joint statement of
                            policy. It concerned the cooperation which each country was to extend to
                            the other in the event that both of them entered the war. The Ambassador
                            had obtained his copy with great difficulty. He found himself in a very
                            embarrassing position since he had been given the responsibility, in the
                            Executive Decree authorizing the trip of the Argentine members to the
                            United States, of handling any questions of international policy. The
                            draft certainly has to do with many important questions of Argentina’s
                            political relations with the United States. Nevertheless, the Argentine
                            members of the Commission state that they only deal with military
                            matters. I do not know what action if any the Argentine Ambassador has
                            taken to inform his Government.</p>
                        <p>I endeavored, through Orme Wilson,<note n="16" xml:id="d362fn16">Liaison
                                Officer with the War and Navy Departments.</note> to get a copy of
                            this project. Captain Spears told Orme Wilson that the project was in a
                            formative stage and would be presented to the United States and
                            Argentine Governments for approval when ready. He was, therefore,
                            unwilling to furnish a copy.</p>
                        <p>I suggest that this matter be the subject of a discussion by you at the
                            next meeting of the Liaison Committee. I think it highly important that
                            this Department have an opportunity to advise on this project while it
                            is in a formative stage just as I think that the Argentine Ambassador
                            should be advising his Commission on the international political
                            aspects.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Welles</hi>: Captain Spears, while entirely
                            courteous, firmly informed me that he and his associates were under
                            written instructions to sign <hi rend="italic">ad referendum</hi> an
                            agreement with the Argentine Commission. Unless new instructions are
                            issued he and his colleagues must comply with existing instructions.</p>
                        <p>Captain Spears, moreover, made it abundantly clear that he and the other
                            military and naval officers making up the United States delegation are
                            most anxious to carry through as originally planned with the Argentine
                            delegation and sign a written document as to what each Government would
                            undertake to do under certain conditions. One of these conditions would
                            be the facilities offered by Argentina in the event of stoppage of
                            communications through the Panama Canal. Moreover, the Argentine Naval
                            authorities have been on good terms with the United States Naval
                            authorities for many years so that the Navy Department would prefer to
                            have the onus for the failure of the agreement to be approved rest upon
                            either the Department or the President.</p>
                        <p>The War Department concurs in these views.</p>
                        <p>Both Departments advise me that they have canvassed this whole question
                            apart from the Liaison meeting and feel very strongly that the rather
                            friendly relationships which have been built up and which may prove
                            useful in the future should not be jeopardized as a result of action
                            taken by them. They would like, therefore, to carry through, sign the
                            agreement, present it to higher authorities including the higher
                            authorities in their own departments who would then inform the Argentine
                            Government of our inability to furnish the armament agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>If, therefore, there is to be any change in the lines along which the War
                            and Navy Departments are working I think it will have to come in the
                            form of instructions issued by General Marshall and Admiral Stark,
                            particularly since the line now being followed was confirmed at the last
                            meeting of the Liaison Committee.</p>

                            Admiral Stark. He is instructing Captain Spears not to sign any written

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Welles</hi>: I understand that in the last two
                            days you have discussed with the Argentine Ambassador and with Captain
                            Spears of the Navy Department the results of the conversations between
                            Argentine military and naval authorities and those of this Government.
                            The Ambassador has also spoken with me and Captain Spears has permitted
                            me to review hastily the documents which have been drawn up for
                            signature.</p>
                        <p>I am impressed by the nonpolitical and cordial atmosphere in which these
                            discussions have taken place. The Argentine Commission made a point in
                            starting the conversations that it was their desire to exclude political
                            conversations in an attempt to arrive at an understanding on a purely
                            technical level of the mutual assistance that each country might lend to
                            the other in the event that it became involved in the war. I am also
                            impressed by the importance of the Argentine fleet which, under the
                            arrangements worked out and in the event Argentina were to enter the
                            war, would prove useful.</p>
                        <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0393"/>
                        <p>In order to maintain as a basis of future operation the plans worked out
                            jointly as well as the cordiality apparently existing particularly
                            between the Navies of the two countries, the following recommendation is
                            submitted: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>That the American Commission be permitted to sign the
                                    report.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>That the President, or if he cannot afford the time, yourself
                                    explain to the Argentine Ambassador, Admiral Saba Sueyro, and
                                    General Lapez jointly the considerations which make it
                                    impossible for the United States Government to give its assent
                                    to the technical recommendation. It seems to me that the
                                    President could point out that the joint recommendation is
                                    premised upon the assumption that Argentina is going to enter
                                    the war as an ally of the United States. That assumption appears
                                    totally unwarranted. Argentina not only has not broken off
                                    diplomatic relations but the President of Argentina has
                                    disclaimed any intention of doing so. Under the circumstances it
                                    would be illogical for the United States to approve an agreement
                                    that is based on a premise which the Argentine Government has
                                    not shown the slightest intention of fulfilling. Therefore, the
                                    signature by the technical commission must not be taken to mean
                                    that this country is prepared to go ahead with the Lend-Lease
                                    Agreement and provide armament.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I believe that in this way the Argentine military and naval authorities
                            would not feel rebuffed. They came here at our invitation and in good
                            faith entered into discussions on the basis of broad directives which
                            subsequent events have shown the political arm of the Argentine
                            Government had no intention of living up to. Were such a course to be
                            followed as that suggested, I believe that our displeasure would be
                            understood, that the Argentine military and naval officers would not
                            feel personally let down, and that they might, at least with respect to
                            certain persons in Argentina, use this influence in favor of a change in
                            Argentine policy.</p>

                        <p>305. The tentative agreement which has been worked out by the Navy
                            Department with the Argentine naval mission comprises a contingent
                            agreement providing for cooperation between our two navies in the event
                            that Argentina enters the war against the Axis. It also provides for the
                            furnishing of matériel to the Argentine Navy over a period of years
                            commencing with the year 1942. The furnishing of such matériel, of
                            course, would be premised upon the signing of a Lend Lease
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0394"/>
                        <p>Our Navy Department is very anxious to avoid any breach of friendly
                            relations with the Argentine Navy. It fears that if the contingent
                            agreement depending upon the entrance of Argentina into the war is not
                            signed the reaction would be so bad within the Argentine Navy as to
                            create serious difficulties for our Navy. It is of course clearly
                            understood that no agreement providing for the furnishing of matériel
                            would be signed and obviously no Lend Lease agreement will be entered
                            into so long as the present policy of the Argentine Government
                            continues.</p>
                        <p>I am inclined to think that the point of view of the Navy Department
                            deserves very careful consideration unless in your judgment the signing
                            of any agreement by the Argentine mission in Washington with our Navy
                            Department would be utilized in such a way by the Argentine Government
                            as to discourage completely the opponents of its present policy.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Welles</hi>: While I was talking with Dr. García
                            Arias of the Argentine Embassy this afternoon, Ambassador Espil dropped
                            in. They then both expressed in emphatic terms their great concern at
                            the current development of relations between Argentina and the United
                            States. They referred specifically to the current negotiations with the
                            Argentine military and naval missions. These negotiations, according to
                            them, will be meaningless unless, in addition to the signing <pb n="383"
                                xml:id="pg_383" facs="0395"/>of military accords, they culminate in
                            the signature and implementation of a lend lease agreement between
                            Argentina and the United States.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the Argentine officials are really concerned at the
                            possibility of an axis attack in Patagonia as well as of developments in
                            Uruguay which might make necessary the rendering of Argentine assistance
                            to that country. They stated that our action in furnishing large amounts
                            of lend lease equipment to Brazil, while Argentina gets nothing, was of
                            real concern to them. They said that the continuance of our present
                            attitude would weaken the hands of our friends in Argentina and would
                            strengthen our enemies.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Espil said that he was afraid that you had not been able to
                            give adequate consideration to this matter because of the many other
                            questions pressing upon you.</p>
                        <p>I will be glad to make a further opportunity to converse with the
                            Ambassador on this subject if you think it desirable; he himself
                            suggested that he “could talk for two hours about it”.</p>
                        <p>(It will shortly become known in Argentina that although Chile has
                            neither broken off relations with the axis or signed a lend lease
                            agreement, certain war matériel is being made available to Chile. I
                            think we should consider, following the signature of the agreements with
                            the Argentine military and naval missions, and without signing a lend
                            lease agreement, the possibility of furnishing a very limited amount of
                            war matériel to Argentina on a Hemisphere defense basis.<note n="23"

                            position of the Argentines who are talking about our policy of
                            reprisals, et cetera.)</p>

                        <p>446. For the Under Secretary. Department’s telegram 305, March 4,
                            midnight. I can well understand our Navy Department’s desire to maintain
                            friendly relations with the Argentine Navy and I recognize the value
                            inherent in an agreement providing for cooperation between our Navies
                            “in the event that Argentina enters the war against the Axis.” The
                            implication conveyed by such a clause, namely, the admission in writing
                            of the possibility of Argentina entering the war against the Axis would
                            in itself be of prime importance.</p>
                        <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0396"/>
                        <p>On the other hand there is little doubt that the Government here would
                            attempt to use the signing of any agreement to create the impression
                            that the position taken by the Argentine Government had not affected our
                            policy so far as the furnishing of war material is concerned. We would
                            have to anticipate I fear the impression for a time at least that we had
                            receded somewhat from our original position.</p>
                        <p>Referring to penultimate paragraph of your telegram effort should be made
                            to avoid creation of impression that we are making a distinction between
                            the Argentine Army and Navy, having in mind the existing jealousies
                            between these services. If this aspect is not carefully handled it might
                            have serious repercussions.</p>
                        <p>Not knowing the contents of the agreement, I am not in a position to
                            comment on whether the undoubted advantages would be compensation for
                            the aforementioned disadvantages. If the agreement is signed I would
                            suggest that a carefully worded statement be issued at the time of
                            signing to the effect that the actual furnishing of material is premised
                            upon the signing of a lend-lease agreement.</p>
                        <p>Regarding such a statement, the inclusion in the agreement of a specific
                            date 1942 when the furnishing of material is to commence would appear to
                            present a difficulty. This might be interpreted here as a commitment to
                            enter into a lease-lend agreement during the current year even though no
                            change in the present policy of the Argentine Government had occurred in
                            the meantime. If this point, provided it is well taken, could be cleared
                            up and the suggested explanatory statement issued, it would make it more
                            difficult for the Argentine Government to make capital out of the
                            signing of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>I do not know whether it would be the intention to publish the text or
                            summary of the agreement if and when signed. If this could be done, the
                            publication accompanied by the statement suggested should indicate that
                            there has been no fundamental change in our policy.</p>

                        <p>387. Since my telegram no. 305 of March 4, midnight, there have been
                            several developments of which I think you should know in the event that
                            during the next 2 or 3 days you are engaged by the Argentine authorities
                            in conversations on this subject.</p>
                        <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0397"/>
                        <p>The plan of military and naval cooperation between the United States and
                            Argentina as developed by the military and naval authorities of the two
                            Governments was premised upon Argentine entry into the war on the side
                            of the United Nations. This premise, although wholly acceptable for the
                            purposes of developing a plan of military and naval collaboration, is
                            wholly unrealistic from the standpoint of political actualities, since
                            the Argentine Government does not have the slightest present intention
                            of entering the war. The Argentine naval authorities and Espil have
                            shown an intense desire that the agreement be signed and approved by the
                            two Governments. In addition to the reason they give for signature,
                            namely, the desirability of maintaining cordial technical relations
                            between the military and naval arms of the two Governments, in my
                            judgment there are two important advantages which would accrue to
                            Argentina without any corresponding benefit to this country. In the
                            first place, Argentina would soon maintain before this Government that
                            the agreement contained a moral commitment on our part to provide
                            armament so that Argentina could be in a position to fulfill its
                            obligations in the event that it were to enter the war. It would request
                            the negotiation of a Lend-Lease agreement and the immediate delivery of
                            the armament set forth in the report to be delivered provided Argentina
                            enters the war. In the second place, Argentina would make it appear to
                            Argentine public opinion that signature of the agreement was positive
                            proof that Argentine policy at the Meeting of Foreign Ministers in Rio
                            was not out of harmony with the policy of the United States and the
                            other American republics.</p>
                        <p>In order to remove this one-sided aspect of the agreement and to secure
                            from Argentina some positive contribution to the maintenance of the
                            security of the Hemisphere, the Argentine Delegation was informed of the
                            desire of the United States Delegation to add certain paragraphs to the
                            agreement reading as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“3. The Argentine Government recognizes the necessity of
                                    maintaining uninterrupted sea communications between the United
                                    States and Argentina. The United States Committee and the
                                    Argentine Delegation agree that the provisions of Annex 4—the
                                    Control and Protection of Shipping—should become effective
                                    immediately. The High Command of the two navies will immediately
                                    make necessary agreements for the control and protection of
                                    shipping. The principles and instructions necessary for the
                                    control and protection of shipping are attached hereto.</p>
                                <p>4. In case the Argentine Government agrees to the above
                                    cooperative measures while remaining in a non-belligerent
                                    status, the Government of the United States will immediately
                                    enter into negotiations with the Argentine Government for the
                                    purpose of making a Lend Lease contract. This contract will
                                    provide for the procurement of the materials and facilities
                                    listed in Annex 5—Section 3 which have been recommended to be

                        <p>The Argentine Delegation replied in writing that this proposal “is a

                            this Delegation for consideration. It is to be regretted that this

                            Government cannot accept it since it would involve his country in the
                            war. He has been instructed to present to the President his Government’s
                            views in the premises. As a first step, he is preparing a memorandum
                            setting forth these views which he expects to give me tomorrow

                                to renew the conversations of General Staffs initiated during the
                                visits to Buenos Aires in 1940 of Captain Spears and Colonel
                                Christian. To this end the Department of State expressed the opinion
                                that it would be mutually advantageous for the Argentine Government
                                to appoint a Military-Naval Commission, which should visit the
                                United States not only with authority to continue those
                                conversations, but also to present the needs of the Argentine Army
                                and Navy with respect to military and naval equipment which,
                                according to the same memorandum, could only be obtained within the
                                near future, under the Lend-Lease <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388"
                                    facs="0400"/>Act. As a result of this invitation, the Argentine
                                Government appointed the Naval and Military Commission which, in
                                execution of its task, was in Washington for the last three
                                months.</p>

                                last, Mr. Laurence Duggan, Political Adviser of the Department,
                                delivered to this Mission the text of a proposed basic agreement
                                between the two Governments<note n="26" xml:id="d372fn26">Enclosure

                                under the terms of the Lend-Lease Act. The same offer was repeated
                                in a note from the Department of State to this Embassy dated
                                December 9 last.<note n="27" xml:id="d372fn27">Not

                            <p>3. The conversations between the Naval-Military Delegations of the
                                two Governments developed in the spirit they had anticipated and in
                                an atmosphere of mutual understanding. Points of view and data for
                                cooperation in continental defense were exchanged, the value of
                                which, in view of possible eventualities, cannot be denied. The
                                Argentine Delegation offered a plan of defense which, in revealing
                                its war preparations, signifies a great demonstration of friendship
                                towards the United States. And lastly, the imminent conclusion of
                                the plan of collaboration which was to have been signed on the 14th
                                instant constitutes, in the Argentine Government’s opinion,
                                noteworthy expressions of its firm desire to cooperate in the common
                                defense.</p>
                            <p>4. Coincident with the above proposals, as the Department has already
                                been orally advised, the Argentine Government, in a Ministerial
                                Resolution, recently decided to accept the proposed basic agreement
                                for the furnishing of armaments under the Lend-Lease Act, suggesting
                                certain modifications as to the amount and dates of delivery of the
                                materials.</p>
                            <p>In fact, this Embassy has received a communication from our Ministry
                                of Foreign Affairs, according to which the amounts offered in the
                                proposed basic agreement which the Department submitted to it last
                                December, would be insufficient to assure the adequate organization
                                of the effectives which our Government considers indispensable to
                                guarantee execution of the defense in the zones subject to our
                                responsibility, which were contemplated in the joint, basic, “United
                                States-Argentine Republic” war plan which has just been discussed in
                                Washington.</p>
                            <p>As the Department must know, the urgent needs of our Army and our
                                Navy were carefully studied during the conversations between the
                                Naval-Military Delegations of the two Governments. From these
                                studies, at least from the technical point of view, there has
                                evolved an <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0401"/>agreement in
                                opinion between the Delegations which exhibits a discrepancy, as
                                regards figures, with the plans originally contemplated.</p>
                            <p>5. Always in the same spirit of cooperation in the plan of
                                continental defense, it is to be pointed out that the Argentine
                                Government, without waiting for the signing of the pertinent
                                agreements, has already taken important measures to forward
                                defensive preparation and has expended large amounts in our country
                                for such purposes. A brief list of such preparatory measures is
                                given below:</p>

                            <p>6. Taking into account the emergencies with which the United States
                                is faced by reason of the war, it is the Argentine Government’s
                                intention not to request transfer of completed armaments, aviation
                                or materials, except in the most moderate amount, compatible with
                                the agreements provided for, and only of those elements which it is
                                practically impossible to manufacture in the country within a short
                                period.</p>
                            <p>The area of Argentine Patagonia and the importance of its vital and
                                vulnerable points demand special measures with a view to strategic
                                mobility. It most urgently requires that automotive, armored and <pb
                                    n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0402"/>air units be supplied. It
                                is on such equipment, and on anti-aircraft artillery, that the
                                efficiency with which our troops—already well instructed and
                                reinforced with effectives—will be able to fulfill their protective
                                or defensive mission will rest.</p>
                            <p>One of the most valuable contributions to continental defense in the
                                southern hemisphere is, in the opinion of the Argentine Government,
                                constituted by the efficient military and naval preparations of
                                commanding officers, officer staffs and other cadres in its Army and
                                Navy and by the ample proportion of instructed reserves which are
                                the product of more than 40 years of compulsory military
                                service.</p>
                            <p>7. From the foregoing, it is obvious that the effectiveness of our
                                cooperation in continental defense is closely bound to the equipment
                                and materials which the Argentine Republic has a probability of
                                receiving in due time to complete the operative value of its Army
                                and Navy.</p>

                        <p>415. My telegrams nos. 387, March 20, noon, and 399, March 21, 9 p.m.
                            Espil has informed me that his telegraphic exchange with his Government
                            took the following sequence.</p>
                        <p>Since the Argentine Delegation did not transmit to the Ministries of War
                            and Marine the text of our counterproposal, he sent the text to the
                            Foreign Office for its information. The Foreign Office then telegraphed
                            him in the sense indicated in the penultimate paragraph of my telegram
                            no. 387 (i.e., instructing him to discuss this question with the
                            President). Espil telegraphed that in accordance with the regular
                            procedure it was necessary for him to advise the President, through the
                            Department, of the purpose of his visit. To this end he was drafting a
                            memorandum. The Foreign Office next telegraphed that he should hold up
                            any further action until the Argentine Government had an opportunity of
                            going over the matter with Admiral Sueyro and General Lapez. Espil wired
                            asking whether this meant that he should not even present the
                            memorandum. Today Espil received a reply to the effect that while it was
                            all right to present the memorandum the memorandum should not refer to
                            our counterproposal regarding convoying since that had not been taken up
                            officially by the Department with him. Espil was further advised by Dr.
                            Ruiz Guiñazú that, after his return from the Chilean inauguration about
                            April 6 to 8, he would consider the matter further but that in the <pb
                                n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0403"/>meantime he was not to request
                            an audience to receive [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] the President.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with these instructions Espil presented a memorandum<note
                                n="28" xml:id="d373fn28"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> which
                            is merely a recapitulation of the origin of the invitation to hold
                            military and naval discussions in Washington, the preliminaries of the
                            negotiations for a basic Lend-Lease agreement, and a statement of the
                            steps already taken by the Government to place Argentina in a position
                            to repel aggression. A copy of his memorandum will be sent to you by air
                            mail.</p>
                        <p>I do not agree that the United States counterproposal was not officially
                            taken up with Espil. Although I did not hand him a copy of the proposal,
                            since he already had it through the courtesy of the Argentine
                            Delegation, I did present the proposition to him with the request that
                            he ascertain the views of his Government. In order, however, to make it
                            impossible for Dr. Ruiz Guiñazú to say that our counterproposal was
                            never formally presented to the Argentine Government, in acknowledging
                            receipt of Espil’s memorandum which was sent under a covering note, I am
                            transmitting formally to Espil a copy of our counterproposal.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of Your Excellency’s note of March 24, 1942 enclosing a
                            memorandum recapitulating the antecedents and the progress of the
                            conversations that have recently taken place in Washington between the
                            Naval and Military authorities of Argentina and the United States.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the proposed agreement under discussion between the
                            military and naval authorities of our two Governments, it will be
                            recalled that the Argentine Delegation informed the United States
                            Delegation that it was not authorized to consider a proposal advanced by
                            the United States Delegation with respect to the control and protection
                            of shipping by Argentina within certain stipulated areas off the coast
                            of Argentina for the reason that the Argentine Delegation considered
                            this proposal of a political character and consequently of a character
                            appropriate for discussion by the proper political authorities of the
                            two Governments. Although I subsequently discussed this proposal with
                            you orally, and you later expressed to me under instructions certain
                            views of your Government, I believe it desirable <pb n="392"
                                xml:id="pg_392" facs="0404"/>to send you formally the exact text of

                        <p>May I reiterate that if your Government finds acceptable this proposal
                            regarding the control and protection of shipping and is ready to put
                            into effect immediately the provisions of Annex IV of the proposed
                            agreement this Government will immediately enter into negotiations with
                            the Argentine Government for the purpose of signing a Lend-Lease
                            agreement. Under this agreement, procurement would be effected of the
                            materials and facilities listed in Annex V—Section 3 of the proposed
                            agreement relating to 1942 in accordance with the recommendation of the

                            Government’s desire to obtain certain motorized equipment. You referred

                        <p>In this connection you may be interested to learn that, owing to the

                            other countries which have taken this step, a decision has been reached
                            to refrain from facilitating to the Argentine Government the same kind
                            of assistance that is being made available to many other American
                            republics. As this decision will prevent the delivery of the motorized
                            equipment desired by the Argentine Government, the Ambassador was
                            informed that, in view of existing conditions, the Government of the
                            United States regretted that it was unable to make available to the
                            Argentine authorities the material in question.</p>

                            Following is translation of note received today from Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“As Your Excellency knows, the Argentine Government, duly
                                appreciative of the plan of collaboration proffered by the
                                Lease-Lend Act, in due course took pertinent steps in Washington,
                                after obtaining the necessary opinions thereon with a view to
                                carrying out insofar as this country is concerned, the program of
                                military aid and supply authorized by that act.</p>
                            <p>In so doing, in accordance with the communications received and with
                                the explanations made personally by Your Excellency in this
                                chancellery, the Argentine Government understood that the loan to be
                                obtained under the Lend-Lease Act did not necessarily depend on the
                                conversations previously suggested by Your Excellency’s Government
                                for the study of a common defense plan. Nevertheless, the
                                military-naval delegation which was sent to the United States for
                                the study of a plan of purchases, was given instructions which, with
                                the collaboration of the Ambassador in Washington made possible the
                                simultaneous discussion of the agreement for the application of the
                                Lease-Lend Act and for the plan of continental defense cooperation,
                                or military agreement, as it was called in the course of the
                                negotiations, thereby admitting the connection logically existing
                                between the purchase plan and the political circumstances to which
                                the plan must apply.</p>
                            <p>The text of the plan of cooperation having been agreed upon in March
                                last by the technical delegations of both countries, the Argentine
                                representatives—this Government concurring—understood that the
                                agreement for the supply of armaments which was implicitly related
                                to the other, would be considered at the same time. However, such
                                was not the opinion of the Department of State, even though the
                                value of the plan of cooperation could be only relative and its
                                fulfillment would certainly be insufficient without the simultaneous
                                application of the supplies agreement which was to assure the
                                material required.</p>
                            <p>This Government however being desirous of promoting with Your
                                Excellency’s Government every possible understanding in keeping with
                                the needs of cooperation called for by present circumstances,
                                authorized its delegation in Washington to sign the plan of
                                defensive cooperation independently, insofar as it implies the
                                recognition of a policy of collaboration adopted in accordance with
                                the obligations assumed by the country, which it is disposed to
                                fulfill in the measure that its resources may permit.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency is aware of the circumstances which also prevented,
                                even in that insufficient form, the conclusion of the agreement
                                negotiated in Washington. Once the terms were modified on which both
                                    <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0406"/>delegations, Argentine
                                and American, had apparently agreed in the first place with a view
                                to establishing the scope of the plan of defensive cooperation, the
                                Department of State submitted to our Embassy in Washington a new
                                proposal subordinating in our case the benefits of the Lend-Lease
                                Act to certain obligations relating to the control and protection of
                                shipping on the Atlantic Coast.</p>
                            <p>This condition which in practice could not apply to the other nations
                                of the continent, thus appears to become an exclusively Argentine
                                obligation which this Government did not deem it possible to accept
                                inasmuch as it implies the creation of a situation of belligerency
                                which the country does not desire and for which it is not
                                prepared.</p>
                            <p>On this occasion, I wish to state to Your Excellency that the
                                Argentine Government, without disregarding the special circumstances
                                that must be borne in mind by the Government of the United States in
                                regulating the delivery of armaments to the various countries which
                                availed themselves of the Lend-Lease Act, hopes at the same time
                                that the difficulties arising in the present negotiations may
                                finally be settled in the spirit of cooperation which at present
                                animates the policy of American countries faced, notwithstanding the
                                diversity of their situations, with similar problems of security and
                                supply.</p>
                            <p>In that same spirit the Argentine Government will facilitate any
                                solution which, within its own possibilities, may signify a useful
                                contribution in the present situation of the continent. In this
                                sense I take pleasure in informing Your Excellency that, after
                                having obtained from the Government of the United States the
                                facilities requested for the incorporation of the tankers <hi

                                under the national flag the Argentine Government has just
                                facilitated in the same manner the transfer of the Argentine tanker
                                    <hi rend="italic">Esso Formosa</hi> to the flag of your country
                                which, as Your Excellency has pointed out, needs its services and
                                has been using the tanker for some time.”</p></quote>

                        <p>In conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday he raised
                            the point referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 of note. I took the position
                            that we had if anything favored Argentina since other nations of
                            continent receiving material under “Lease-Lend” had either declared war
                            or broken with Axis Powers. Minister for Foreign Affairs used same
                            arguments set forth in note as reasons why he felt Government could not
                            accept our proposals. To my question whether German submarine attack on
                                <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> might not alter their attitude, he
                            replied he would have to await further reports on this matter before
                            venturing opinion. However, his subsequent remarks on general situation
                            did not hold out much encouragement.</p>

                            no. 760, of April 24, 12 midnight, forwarding the translation of a note
                            received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on that date with regard
                            to certain proposals of our Government in connection with the furnishing
                            of material for the Argentine Navy under the Lease-Lend Act, I have the
                            honor to transmit herewith a copy, together with translation, of the
                            note in question.<note n="34" xml:id="d377fn34">For translation of note,
                                see telegram No. 760, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note></p>
                        <p>As stated in my telegram under reference, in a conversation with the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs on the day previous to the receipt of the
                            note, Dr. Ruiz Guiñazú made the point that in exacting certain
                            obligations relating to the control and protection of shipping as a
                            condition precedent to the supplying of materials under the Lease-Lend
                            Act, our Government was discriminating against Argentina, since a
                            similar condition was not stipulated in the case of the other American
                            Republics which had received or been promised assistance under the Act.
                            I took the position that, far from discriminating against Argentina, I
                            felt that our Government had made an exception in their favor in that
                            the other nations of the continent which had been promised material
                            under the Lease-Lend Act had either declared war against or broken
                            relations with the Axis Powers.</p>
                        <p>To be sure, agreements with certain of these Governments may have been
                            made prior to the decisions taken at Rio; nevertheless it seemed to me
                            that the principle is clear and that our Government’s proposal to make
                            available certain material to the Argentine Navy under the conditions
                            stipulated cannot be interpreted as discrimination against this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>In a conversation with the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs last
                            evening I took this same position with Dr. Gache. To my surprise Dr.
                            Gache stated that his Government felt that our proposals for convoy
                            constituted a more drastic step towards war against the Axis even than
                            the breaking of relations, since use of Argentine war ships for this
                            purpose would inevitably lead to a clash with the Axis. I pointed out to
                            Dr. Gache that the action of the Germans in sinking United States and
                            other vessels carrying much-needed materials for Argentina virtually
                            constituted a blockade of this country and it would seem only
                            logical—aside from this country’s commitments in continental
                            defense—that they should take the necessary steps to <pb n="396"
                                xml:id="pg_396" facs="0408"/>assure the safe delivery of materials
                            essential to this country’s economy. He did not give any indication,
                            however, that the Government was considering any change in its position
                            from that indicated in the note under reference.</p>
                        <p>I understand, from other sources, that Admiral Sueyro and the naval
                            officers who accompanied him to Washington are very bitter at what they
                            consider to have been the arbitrary action of the State Department in
                            imposing these further conditions at the last moment after they had come
                            to a complete agreement and understanding with our naval authorities on
                            other points which would have made possible the supply of materials
                            required.</p>

                                    Republic of Argentina</hi></head>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                                the receipt of Your Excellency’s note of April 24, 1942 with respect
                                to discussions between representatives of our two Governments
                                concerning collaboration in hemisphere defense and the provision of
                                matériel under lend-lease arrangements. Immediately upon receiving
                                this communication from <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0409"
                                />Your Excellency, I transmitted it to my Government, which has now
                                instructed me to reply to you as follows:</p>
                            <p>My Government is impressed by the desire of Your Excellency’s
                                Government to make its contribution toward the solution of the
                                problems of security and supply which confront the Argentine
                                Republic and the United States as well as the other American
                                republics. My Government hopes that, on account of this attitude, it
                                will be possible for the two Governments to arrive at an identical
                                appraisal of the situation which confronts them so that the
                                difficulties which have arisen in these negotiations may be
                                immediately resolved to their mutual benefit. Indeed, it is
                                precisely the nature of that situation which has dictated the
                                current policy of the Government of the United States.</p>
                            <p>Following the drastic reversal in the international situation caused
                                by the fall of France, the American republics, fully aware of the
                                extreme peril and having declared that any attempt on the part of a
                                non-American state against the integrity or the inviolability of the
                                territory, the sovereignty, or the political independence of an
                                American state should be considered as an aggression against all of
                                them, actively engaged in strengthening their defenses and their
                                armed forces against all eventualities and in organizing cooperation
                                for defense among them. During this period, the Government of the
                                United States offered to enter into both lend-lease arrangements and
                                military conversations with the Government of Argentina.</p>
                            <p>As a result of the aggression of Japan upon the United States on
                                December 7, 1941 and the immediately following declarations of war
                                by Italy and Germany, a very different situation has existed. The
                                United States and nine of the other American republics are at war
                                with the Axis. In addition, nine of the remaining republics have
                                broken off diplomatic and economic relations with the Axis. All
                                nineteen of these republics have, to a greater or lesser degree,
                                each according to its means, taken active, even drastic, measures to
                                eliminate Axis activity within their frontiers.</p>
                            <p>In accordance with its intention to render assistance to the utmost
                                of its ability to the American republics which have thus placed
                                themselves in the forefront of hemispheric defense, the Government
                                of the United States has made available to these American republics
                                all of the military and naval matériel which it could possibly spare
                                in order that by so doing it might make the utmost possible
                                contribution to the cause of hemispheric solidarity and to the
                                practical defense of the New World. Because of the imperative demand
                                for matériel at the fighting fronts in Europe, in Asia, in Africa,
                                and in the South Seas, and the training requirements of the United
                                Nations, it has unfortunately not been possible for the Government
                                of the United <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0410"/>States to
                                make available to these other American republics all of the military
                                and naval matériel which is required by them in the common interest
                                of all.</p>
                            <p>It is of course obvious, in view of the situation above indicated,
                                that the Government of the United States could not conceivably
                                divert vitally needed naval or military matériel to the Governments
                                of the American republics which have made no effective contribution
                                to the cause of hemispheric defense.</p>
                            <p>It was because of this consideration of indisputable validity that my
                                Government offered Argentina a proposal to collaborate in keeping
                                open the sea lanes between Argentina and the United States over
                                which flows the trade which is so important to the well-being and
                                protection of our two countries. My Government has felt that were
                                the Argentine Republic to undertake this responsibility, it would be
                                contributing in a practical and effective measure to the cause of
                                hemispheric solidarity and to the cause of hemispheric defense and
                                that under such conditions all of the nineteen American republics,
                                of which the United States is one and to which reference is above
                                made, would have jointly felt that under such circumstances the
                                Argentine Republic should legitimately share in the supplies of
                                armament available to my Government for distribution among the other
                                American republics.</p>
                            <p>My Government considers the proposal made to Argentina for protection
                                of shipping in waters adjacent to Argentina eminently fair and
                                reasonable. The United States today is utilizing such of its naval
                                forces as are available for the protection of shipping in the north
                                and even south Atlantic, including shipping to and from Argentina.
                                The least that Argentina should be willing to do is to give
                                protection to such shipping off Argentine shores.</p>
                            <p>My Government, therefore, sincerely regrets to learn the indication
                                of your Government in its note of April 24, 1942 that Argentina is
                                not disposed to collaborate effectively in the manner proposed in
                                order to further the cause in which nineteen of the American
                                republics are actively cooperating. Candor requires my Government to
                                state that it finds itself in disagreement with the conclusion that
                                the proposal implies the creation of a state of belligerency. The
                                history of the last few years offers many instances of naval action
                                taken by a neutral country in protection of its shipping that did
                                not result in a state of belligerency. The example of my own country
                                might be cited which, for many months prior to the declaration of
                                war upon it by Germany and Italy, was taking daily naval action to
                                assure that its ships arrived safely in the ports of many distant
                                lands. The United States did not become a belligerent as a result of
                                that action.</p>
                            <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0411"/>
                            <p>If the proposal appears like an exclusively Argentine obligation, it
                                is because the nineteen other American republics have already taken
                                steps of far greater consequence and risk. Ten of them are at war
                                with the Axis countries, and another nine have broken off diplomatic
                                relations. In the absence of either action by Argentina, my
                                Government hoped for some positive measures by Argentina that would
                                persuade the other eighteen countries that Argentina was making its
                                contribution to the maintenance of hemisphere solidarity and
                                therefore was entitled to share in the distribution of the armament
                                available for the other American republics.</p>
                            <p>In view of the position of your Government, my Government regrets to
                                find itself unable to proceed with the signature of the agreement
                                which has been under consideration by the appropriate authorities of
                                our two Governments and with the negotiation of a Lend-Lease
                                agreement which is, of course, in itself only incidental to the
                                actual provision of matériel.</p>
                            <p>Accept, Excellency, the assurances of my most distinguished
                                consideration.</p>

                            in reply to latter’s note of April 24 regarding protection of shipping
                            between Argentina and the United States. In my recent conversation with
                            the Acting President I discussed question of their undertaking to
                            protect ships from southern point of Brazil to Argentine ports along the
                            lines of my conversation with Minister for Foreign Affairs (Embassy’s

                            in proposal and promised to study the matter further with the Minister
                            of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <p>I have since learned from the Minister of the Interior that Castillo
                            mentioned the matter to him, from which I judge that he is giving

                        <p>In view of this I think it would be wise to postpone addressing note to

                        <p>240. For Duggan.<note n="36" xml:id="d381fn36">Laurence Duggan, Adviser
                                on Political Relations.</note> In my recent cables I have emphasized
                            the difficult problem faced by friendly newspapers by reason of lack of
                            shipping space for newsprint. Unfortunately it does not appear that any
                            of the shipments mentioned in Department’s 54, January 13, 4 p.m.<note
                                n="37" xml:id="d381fn37">Not printed.</note> are scheduled for
                            Argentina. Neither could the total mentioned 4,500 tons, do much to
                            alleviate the situation as Argentina normally imports over 125,000 tons
                            annually. I understand that the Argentine Government has been asked to
                            assign space on its vessels and that the Acting President<note n="38"
                                xml:id="d381fn38">Ramón S. Castillo.</note> has agreed in principle.
                            There have also been rumors to the effect that the Government might
                            consider assigning an entire ship to newsprint and some publishers fear
                            that should such a decision be taken, it might mean the allocation by
                            the Government here of this newsprint or some other equally effective
                            government control, making it more difficult for those publications
                            critical of administration policy to obtain paper. Consequently, I feel
                            it essential that our Government make possible sufficient space on
                            American ships to assure, first, immediate delivery of paper now on
                            docks in New York to replenish stocks now almost exhausted for such
                            papers as <hi rend="italic">La Prensa, La Nación, Noiicias Gráficas, La
                                Razón, El Día, Buenos Aires Herald</hi>, et cetera, and second, to
                            provide a program for the future whereby deliveries of minimum needs can
                            be made as secure as is practicable. Likewise, it is hoped that our
                            export control will be so exercised as to provide that this paper will
                            continue to be shipped to the ultimate consignee and not to any central
                            organization which might be empowered to make the distribution here. The
                            Central Bank might be construed as having that authority now. (See

                            control can be exercised both to the end that prodemocratic press may be

                            Acting President stated that he had ordered one of the Argentine
                            merchant ships which had left recently for the United States to load a
                            cargo of newsprint instead of coal. He added that this first shipment
                            would satisfy the immediate needs and that future requirements would
                            also be met by the Government according to a plan to carry newsprint in
                            Government vessels. According to <hi rend="italic">La Nacíon’s</hi>
                            account the Acting President stated that the newsprint will be
                            distributed proportionally permitting the continued operation of all
                            newspapers, and that within a few days an organization would be set up
                            to allocate the newsprint. Newspapers will have representation in the

                        <p>229. Your 275, February 14, 3 p.m. Is it the intention of the Government
                            to distribute newsprint among all papers, desirable and undesirable? If
                            not, what papers will receive newsprint? Do you believe that the
                            Government will attempt to control the distribution of that newsprint
                            which comes on United States or United States-controlled vessels? Do you
                            foresee an attempt by the Government to control editorial policies of
                            the papers involved to the detriment of <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402"
                                facs="0414"/>our interests? Do you advise approval, at least for the
                            time being, of export licenses for newsprint consigned to the Argentine
                            Government? In this connection preliminary information indicates that
                            the 2,000 tons of newsprint on the <hi rend="italic">Rio Tercero</hi> is
                            for the use of the Argentine Government.</p>

                        <p>376. As you have been previously informed, there is an impending shortage
                            of tankers for petroleum deliveries both to the east coast of the United
                            States and to Latin America. It is not desired to apply whatever
                            reduction is necessary in deliveries against industries producing
                            materials for our war effort. These should continue to be supplied with
                            their full requirements. In Argentina the following companies have been
                            tentatively selected: Armour, Swift, LaBlanca, Wilson, Bovril,
                            Frigorífico Anglo, Smithfield and government-owned packing houses.</p>

                            that the Argentine Government has cabled its Embassy in Washington,
                            asking it to ascertain from our Government the amount of shipping space
                            which can be allotted for newsprint to Argentina on our vessels and is
                            also planning to address a similar communication to this Embassy. After
                            receipt of this data the Argentine Government will allot space on its
                            own vessels. Refer to my telegram No. 665, April 14, 6 p.m.<note n="41"

                        <p>728. By decree promulgated April 20 published by yesterday’s press
                            merchant vessels of foreign registry may not be repaired in Argentina
                            without prior authorization from the Ministry of Marine. In determining
                            whether or not authorization shall be granted the Ministry will take
                            into consideration the need for the repairs and their cost.</p>
                        <p>The decree provides that repairs will be authorized on the express
                            condition that the owners of the vessels import into Argentina within a
                            period of 6 months materials of the same quantity and quality as those
                            employed. As a guarantee of the importation of the new materials the
                            owners will be obliged to deposit in the Central Bank to the order of
                            the Ministry of Marine an amount equal to the total value of the
                            materials used. If the owners fail to comply with this undertaking the
                            deposit will be forfeited to the Government.</p>
                        <p>It is also provided that the contracts for the repairs to foreign vessels
                            must be submitted to the Ministry of Marine and that work may not be
                            commenced until the corresponding permit has been issued.</p>
                        <p>The official justification for this measure is that many foreign ships
                            have been repaired locally utilizing materials which under present
                            conditions are exceedingly difficult if not impossible to replace owing
                            to the fact that all countries have restricted their exportation.</p>
                        <p>The British Embassy here is desirous of acting jointly with us in the
                            event our respective governments should decide to take action in this
                            manner and I should therefore appreciate receiving the views of the
                            Department.</p>

                        <p>605. Your 728, April 22, 6 p.m. The materials which this Government has
                            allocated to Argentine shipyards are for the purpose of repairing ships
                            of friendly nations—i.e. those of the United Nations and the American
                            republics. The allocation of steel plates to Mihanovich,<note n="42"
                                xml:id="d387fn42">Cia. Argentina de Navegación Mihanovich,
                                Ltda.</note> for example, was made on the basis of the size of the
                            yard and the probable amount of business.</p>
                        <p>Many, if not all, of the countries referred to above are unable to
                            replace materials which are utilized in the repair of their boats. The
                            United States has recognized this fact and has acted accordingly in the
                            matter of supplying Argentina.</p>
                        <p>If this new measure taken by Argentina hampers or restricts in any way
                            the repair of ships which are working directly or indirectly in the
                            United Nation war effort, this Government will be forced to divert
                            repair materials and ships to other ports where such restrictions do not
                            exist.</p>
                        <p>The Department recently took extraordinary action to obtain an
                            allocation, a priority and an export license on 800 tons of steel plates
                            for Mihanovich. The 800 tons have not yet been shipped and will not be
                            released until appropriate assurances have been obtained from Argentina
                            that the materials we supply will be made available to all ships of
                            friendly nations without the obligation of replacement. Furthermore, it
                            is not desirable to have Argentina force ships in need of repairs to
                            proceed to other ports where repair facilities might be less adequate,
                            solely for the purpose of maintaining in Argentina a hoard of
                            materials.</p>
                        <p>You should obtain promptly these assurances in any form you deem
                            appropriate, either jointly with the British Embassy or separately.</p>

                            p.m., you should not take joint action with the British Embassy in this

                        <p>The Embassy of the United States of America makes reference to Decree No.
                            116279 promulgated by the Argentine Government on March 26, 1942,
                            concerning repairs to ships under foreign flags which are to be made in
                            the shipyards within the territory of the Argentine Republic and
                            respectfully invites the attention of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
                            and Worship to the following observations of the Department of State
                            relative to the provisions of this measure:</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States has allocated to the Argentine
                            shipyards certain quantities of materials for the purpose of repairing
                            ships of friendly nations, that is, those of the United Nations and of
                            the American Republics. Many of such countries are unable to replace
                            materials utilized in the repair of their ships as required by Decree
                            No. 116279, and the Government of the United States recognizing this
                            situation has acted accordingly in making allocations of steel plates
                            and other repair materials for use in Argentina.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the measures proposed in the decree above referred to
                            would seriously delay the repair of ships which are working directly or
                            indirectly in the United Nations’ war effort, since the decree provides
                            that estimates or contracts covering the work to be undertaken for the
                            repair of ships in Argentine shipyards must be submitted to the Ministry
                            of Marine and authorization granted before repairs to ships can be
                            undertaken. Furthermore, ships under the registry of the United States
                            Government are now operated by the War Shipping Administration, an
                            agency of the United States Government, and it would not seem consistent
                            for the Argentine Government to require a deposit by the United States
                            Government as a guarantee for the replacement of materials utilized in
                            the repair of its ships, since such materials in most cases would have
                            been previously allocated to Argentine shipyards by the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Therefore the Government of the United States ventures to express the
                            hope that the Argentine Government will modify the terms of Decree No.
                            116279 with a view to permitting the materials that are supplied from
                            the United States to be made available to all ships of friendly nations
                            without the obligation of replacement and thus not render it necessary
                            for ships in need of repairs to proceed to other ports where facilities
                            might be less adequate than those in Argentine shipyards.</p>

                            last evening and explained that measure was adopted at his suggestion in
                            order to conserve stocks of steel plates to insure adequate supplies for
                            repair of state merchant marine vessels and more especially to prevent
                            what he described as illegal exports to certain countries, notably
                            Spain, of considerable quantities of plates and materials ordered for
                            repairs to foreign ships here in excess of materials actually required
                            for them.</p>
                        <p>He insisted that there was no other or hidden reason for the measure and
                            asserted most categorically that it was not the intention of his
                            Government to delay in any way the servicing of foreign ships in
                            Argentine ports. He added that the decree in question had been suspended
                            until May 25 in order to allow for general discussion of the matter with
                            a view to reaching a solution satisfactory to the British and ourselves.
                            After conferring with British the Department will be advised of any
                            conclusions reached.</p>

                            Department the assurances requested in its telegram no. 605, April 30 as
                            you no doubt realize. Please report the manner in which this

                            This matter should be thoroughly investigated by the Embassy with a view
                            to enabling the immediate downward revision of the Argentine allocation

                        <p>British Embassy advises that Admiral Stewart, Director of the Argentine
                            State Merchant Marine, when consulted a few days ago on the status of
                            the decree, stated that there was nothing to worry about since the

                        <p>The British Embassy is of the opinion that there need be no further

                            Department’s position in withholding shipments of steel designed for
                            ship repairs but suggests that we be authorized to inform the Argentine
                            Government that shipments are being permitted to come forward on the

                        <p>A–68. Local newsprint importers have reported to the Embassy that there
                            is discrimination in the United States against shipments of newsprint to
                            Argentina. One local importer received a letter from the law firm
                            Wilkie, Owen, Otis, Farr &amp; Gallagher, 15 Broad Street, New York,
                            which stated in part: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The problem of newsprint cargo has now been placed under the
                                    control of a central commission and the policy has been decided
                                    upon with regard to South American shipments. The Board of
                                    Economic Warfare and the War Shipping Administration are
                                    allotting so much tonnage for each country, according to Mr.
                                    (the name was cut out by the censor). The commission, in the
                                    case of unfriendly countries, is using its discretion as to
                                    newsprint cargo which shall be allotted.”</p></quote></p>
                        <p>The Embassy believes that the intimation that Argentina will be
                            discriminated against in the shipments of newsprint is fallacious and
                            that Mr. Wilkie has been misinformed, since the press, which is 95%
                            pro-Ally, is one of the greatest supporters of the Allied cause in
                            Argentina.</p>
                        <p>The fact that such information is presumably given out to persons outside
                            the Government, is in itself dangerous. The reports invariably reach
                            interested parties here who use the information against the United
                            States. The Embassy would appreciate receiving confirmation that there
                            will be no discrimination in shipments of newsprint <pb n="409"

                        <p>In view of Argentina’s attitude and actions to date, the Embassy has no
                            reason to believe that the Argentine authorities would be willing to
                            join the Pool on the above basis, and therefore believes that it is
                            preferable not to make the direct proposal. In the discussion which the
                            Embassy will hold with the Argentine authorities, the Embassy will make
                            it clear that no more critical materials can be spared nor any export
                            licenses issued, except that if the Argentine Government should decide
                            to collaborate in the petroleum Pool operation, the United States
                            Government would then be prepared to make further sacrifices, which
                            would be justified by the way in which Argentina would lighten the
                            petroleum transportation load now being carried by the United States
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Should it be that the Department would welcome the adherence of Argentina
                            to the Tanker Pool on some basis less severe than the Embassy’s
                            understanding of the present basis as outlined above, the Department’s
                            instructions would be appreciated. For instance, if the Department
                            approves, in the original discussion with the Foreign Office it might be
                            suggested that an acceptable basis for Argentine participation in the
                            Pool would be: <list>

                            in Argentina, so that the best of the governmental reserves would be
                            drilled as soon as possible. (By law, the mixed companies are eligible
                            to drill in the reserved areas.) A participation in this manner by all
                            of the oil operators in Argentina would be sure to result in a greatly
                            increased production within twelve months, and might even make Argentina
                            entirely independent of outside petroleum resources, within a very few
                            years.</p>

                        <p>There has been considerable objection on the part of Y.P.F. to the

                            Argentina provide absolute protection to the national interests, and it
                            is very difficult to see how anything but benefit could accrue to the
                            nation through an all-out effort of this kind. It would be necessary for
                            Argentina to accept the fact that Y.P.F. would be giving up any hope of
                            having a petroleum monopoly, but it is entirely possible that Y.P.F.
                            could retain permanently its present percentage of the market, and form
                            a cartel arrangement with the other oil companies in the country under

                        <p>1265. Embassy’s A–73 of August 12. Your understanding of what full
                            participation in the Pool would mean in Argentina’s case is in the main
                            correct. To take the position however that Argentina’s own production
                            must be shared with other republics is definitely an extension of the
                            principles upon which the Pool was originally based. All that can fairly
                            be represented without such extension of principle is that no pool
                            tankers will be used to supply any country which is capable of supplying
                            itself from its own production at the same level as the others. From the
                            beginning however, it has been made clear that all pool members must use
                            their oil importing tankers in the common interest on a basis of
                            equality. This would not apply to Argentina’s tankers used in her own
                            coastwise crude movement.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes that the basis suggested by Embassy which
                            contemplates pooling of tankers available for importing and considering
                            all crude production in excess of the last 12 month average as
                            exportable with an understanding as to material to be supplied from here
                            for use by mixed companies in further development of exportable
                            production, might lead to a satisfactory solution. In fact our recent
                            informal discussions here with Catinari<note n="51" xml:id="d397fn51"
                                >Juan Norberto Catinari, temporarily in the United States, attached
                                to the Argentine Embassy.</note> of YPF and members of the Argentine
                            Embassy have been along this line. In these discussions Catinari stated
                            that, in his personal opinion, Argentina would not view with favor the
                            exportation of locally produced oil because their proven reserves are
                            insufficient to guarantee continued supply for <pb n="412"
                                xml:id="pg_412" facs="0424"/>Argentina. He appeared satisfied with
                            the suggestion that this government give assurance that any oil thus
                            exported would be replaced in kind, that is by sale of oil to Argentina,
                            following the war emergency. It is suggested that you include the same
                            provision in your discussions.</p>
                        <p>It is important that you do not commit this government to supplying any
                            material nor to any other final agreement until so instructed. You
                            should however press your discussions with the utmost vigor along the
                            lines you have indicated and keep Department informed currently by
                            telegram as to developments. If Department is thus informed its
                            discussions and other actions can be shaped and timed to give you the
                            best possible support. Particularly the Department wishes to be kept
                            closely informed as to the reactions of government officials and of YPF
                            to the mixed company idea. It is the Department’s opinion that the mixed
                            company plan has fundamental merits which may make it most effective in
                            averting serious difficulties which have been experienced elsewhere.</p>

                                    state that the Germans will sink them if they use them in the

                        <p>1325. Since Department’s cable no. 1265 of August 22, officers of the
                            Department have had informal conversations with García Arias<note n="55"
                                xml:id="d401fn55">Argentine Chargé.</note> and extensive discussions
                            with Catinari, who Department understands has held responsible position
                            in YPF for several years prior to joining Embassy here. Catinari has
                            also spent several days in New York with Petroleum Supply Committee for
                            Latin America acquainting himself with its methods of operation and the
                            statistical oil supply situation in the various American republics
                            concerned. The Petroleum Supply Committee has been very frank and
                            cooperative in giving him an accurate picture of the situation and of
                            aims, accomplishments and problems of the joint supply program. Upon his
                            return from New York Catinari appeared wholly in favor of bringing YPF
                            into this joint program on the basis of using Argentina’s importing
                            tankers to assist in supplying other republics and perhaps exporting any
                            oil produced in excess of present rate in return for materials from this
                            country. He seemed strongly disposed to carry on these negotiations at
                            this end and to refer them to Buenos Aires only for final approval.</p>

                        <p>The Department held a further meeting on September 3 with García Arias
                            and Catinari at which the Minister asked certain questions which would
                            enable him to place the entire question before the Argentine Government.
                            The questions may be summarized as follows: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>What political implications would be attached to Argentina’s
                                    action in becoming a member of the Pool? To this Department
                                    answered informally none whatever, beyond the perfectly obvious
                                    indication of willingness to assist in maintaining the essential
                                    economies of the other American republics.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>What is the relation of the national petroleum committees and
                                    the Petroleum Supply Committee for Latin America in New York
                                    with the various governments? To this the Department replied
                                    that matters of broad policy were to be taken up between the
                                    governments at a high diplomatic level. Matters of execution
                                    would be handled through the Petroleum Supply Committee for
                                    Latin America and the national petroleum committees. The
                                    national petroleum committees in each case are set up as the
                                    government in question desires—usually with a governmental
                                    member as chairman.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>Would this Government facilitate the acquisition by Argentina
                                    of the two Swedish tankers now under negotiation, if Argentina
                                    agreed to share their use with other republics? To this the
                                    Department answered that if Argentina were to participate fully
                                    in the petroleum supply arrangements, this Government would give
                                    appropriate assistance to Argentina in the safe passage of the
                                    two Swedish tankers.</item>
                                <label>(4)</label>
                                <item>Assuming that Argentina’s share in the so-called pool were to
                                    supply Uruguay’s requirements, what quantities of oil would be
                                    involved and what would be its source? To this the Department
                                    answered informally that Mr. Catinari had been furnished
                                    information concerning Uruguay’s needs.</item>
                                <label>(5)</label>
                                <item>If Argentina collaborated in the joint supply program in
                                    accordance with the principles which have been established for
                                    its guidance modified as might be agreed to take Argentina’s
                                    special circumstances into account, on what basis would this
                                    Government supply material for production and refining? To this
                                    the Department answered informally that this Government would be
                                    likely to make a comparable sacrifice by diverting material from
                                    extremely important uses here to Argentina, but that certain
                                    subsidiary questions arise in this connection concerning the
                                    allocation of this material among and its utilization by the
                                    several oil companies operating in Argentina.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Department is inclined to believe that these negotiations should remain
                            in your hands and consequently will as far as possible confine itself to
                            general statements at this end. Since the entire question is of high
                            importance, however, you are requested to press the negotiations as
                            urgently as is permissible. Moreover Department must be kept informed by
                            telegram concerning discussions at your end to avoid confusion in
                            dealings here over which Department does not have complete
                            initiative.</p>

                            should be severed and any proceeds or funds arising there from should be

                        <p>On August 12, 1942 the Embassy at Buenos Aires informed the Department
                            that an arrangement had been made to sell the <hi rend="italic">Buenos

                            recommended that the vessel be deleted from the Proclaimed List. On
                            August 14, 1942 my Government took action ordering such deletion to be
                            published in the next supplement of the List.</p>
                        <p>With respect to its notes relating to the <hi rend="italic">Comodoro
                                Rivadavia</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Madryn</hi>, which vessels
                            present an entirely parallel case, the Embassy at Buenos Aires received
                            no reply until on September 12, 1942 the press of Buenos Aires reported
                            the purchase of these vessels by the Argentine Navy and State Merchant
                            Marine respectively, the purchase price of 6,400,000 pesos being turned
                            over in free funds to the former owners. The Embassy subsequently
                            received an informal confirmation of these press reports, but to date
                            has received no reply or statement from the Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States is constrained to point out the
                            obvious implications of such payments of free funds to persons, whom it
                            considers as of enemy status and as inimical to the security of the
                            Hemisphere, and to state that it deems such actions to be inconsistent
                            with the Inter-American Resolutions referred to above and with the
                            spirit of the plan of the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory
                            Committee, which it recognizes does not apply directly to the two
                            vessels in question. It accordingly requests that the Argentine
                            Government take appropriate steps effectively to control the funds in
                            question.</p>

                        <p>Messrs. Hughes and Gantenbein called today by appointment upon Admiral
                            Francisco Stewart for the purpose of discussing various of the pending
                            ship matters. After preliminary remarks, Admiral Stewart was handed a
                            memorandum, a copy of which is attached hereto,<note n="71"
                                xml:id="d404fn71">Not printed.</note> setting forth the position of
                            the United States with respect to the contemplated payment of 565,000
                            pesos in free funds to Mr. Isaac Gutman Iterman and to the Organización
                            Comercial e Industrial Financiera Argentina, in which Mr. Iterman has a
                            substantial interest, in connection with the purchase by the Merchant
                            Marine of the three ex-German ships now called the <hi rend="italic">San
                                Martin, Santa Fé</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Belgrano</hi>. This
                            memorandum had been prepared after Admiral Stewart, during a courtesy
                            visit at the Embassy several days ago, had stated that he was not
                            familiar with the problem involved in these contemplated payments. After
                            glancing at the memorandum, Admiral Stewart said that it was the
                            impression which he gathered at Washington that the Inter-American
                            Financial and Economic Advisory Committee was disposed to modify the
                            exception provided for with respect to paragraph (<hi rend="italic"
                                >c</hi>) of the Committee’s interpretation of article 5 (<hi
                                rend="italic">d</hi>) of the ship plan. However, he recognized that
                            there was no analogy between the present matter and the <hi
                                rend="italic">Rio Colorado</hi> case, which Dr. Liaudat of the
                            Central Bank (who is a member of the Merchant Marine board) had
                            previously claimed to be analogous.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Stewart was told that since Mr. Iterman had a banking business at
                            Santa Fé and presumably loaned the money in question from funds
                            available for investment purposes, it was not seen how he or his
                            financial company could object to accepting in blocked form treasury or
                            other obligations which would be bearing interest and thereby adding to
                            the value of his assets. Admiral Stewart appeared very sympathetic to
                            this consideration and said that it was possible that the Merchant
                            Marine might even make provision for an additional one or two percent
                            interest, which would also be blocked.</p>
                        <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0432"/>
                        <p>Reference was then made to the Delfino payment. Admiral Stewart stated
                            that Dr. Torriani, head of the commercial and consular division of the
                            Foreign Office, is having an investigation made concerning the
                            possibilities of freezing the properties which Sr. Delfino purchased
                            with the amount which had been recently paid to him in free funds (which
                            properties now appear to include 1,500,000 pesos paid for acquiring a
                            part interest in the Hotel Richmond in this city). He said that he would
                            see Dr. Torriani this afternoon and attempt to expedite the completion
                            of the investigation.</p>
                        <p>At this point Admiral Stewart gave an account of events preceding the
                            payments in question. He stated that it was at first desired to buy
                            these vessels for the purpose of maintaining a military force in
                            Patagonia but that difficulties were encountered in finding available
                            funds. Later, however, arrangements for acquiring the ships (primarily
                            for other purposes) were made by the Ministry of Marine, which signed a
                            contract with Sr. Delfino, apparently without adequately appreciating
                            the factors involved in paying Sr. Delfino in free funds. He added that
                            the matter had been complicated by the fact that Sir David Kelly, the
                            British Ambassador, shortly before the actual payment was made, had gone
                            to Admiral Fincati, the Minister of Marine, and had greatly antagonized
                            Admiral Fincati by intimating that Great Britain might curtail its meat
                            purchases from Argentina if the payment were made to Sr. Delfino, which
                            Admiral Fincati felt was an offence against the national dignity.
                            Admiral Fincati, he said, reported the matter immediately to President
                            Castillo, with the result that there was felt to be no alternative to
                            paying the amount in question. (It is understood that Admiral Stewart
                            described the same incident while in Washington.) However, Admiral
                            Stewart also mentioned that President Castillo felt that the Government
                            had to make the payment inasmuch as it was obligated to do so under the
                            terms of the contract to which the Government was a party and which had
                            been made pursuant to a Government decree.</p>
                        <p>In reply to an inquiry as to the status of the shipping agreement which
                            had been recently negotiated at Washington, Admiral Stewart commented
                            that although the formal signature of the agreement was awaiting the
                            satisfactory solution of the Delfino matter, it had been arranged in
                            Washington that it would be placed in effect following its initialing
                            and that it was, therefore, in effect now.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the case of the <hi rend="italic">Esmeralda</hi>, Admiral
                            Stewart said that this vessel was still in Pernambuco. There had been
                            some delay, he said, in moving it to Buenos Aires due to the fact that
                            the Merchant Marine feared that the twelve or thirteen Rumanian seamen
                            on the ship, who were previously employed by Mr. Vlasov, might be
                            instigated by Mr. Vlasov to cause difficulties with reference to
                            insurance, <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0433"/>and therefore it was
                            the plan of the Merchant Marine to supply the ship with other seamen.
                            Concerning the claims against the ship to be paid in free funds, Admiral
                            Stewart said that it had been definitely decided that these would not be
                            paid until after the ship arrived in Buenos Aires and until after the
                            United States and British Governments had been consulted with respect to
                            the individual claims. When asked, however, whether it would not be
                            necessary to pay the port dues and perhaps the other taxes of the
                            Brazilian Government, Admiral Stewart did not seem to be familiar with
                            the details of the matter. Regarding the list of claims which had been
                            promised to the Embassy by Dr. Liaudat several weeks ago, Admiral
                            Stewart said that this list would be furnished shortly.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the purchase of bunkers from the Italian Government in
                            connection with the purchase of the sixteen Italian ships, Admiral
                            Stewart said that these funds would be definitely blocked.</p>
                        <p>When inquiry was made about the Delfino tugboats, which had previously
                            belonged to the Hamburg American Line, Admiral Stewart stated that it
                            was his understanding that there were twelve of these that had been
                            taken over not from Sr. Delfino’s company but through the intermediary
                            of Sr. Delfino as agent of the owners. In any event, he said that the
                            funds had been blocked.</p>

                            the Flota is discriminating against certain papers by refusing to carry

                            sailed November 8. Since then, the Flota has refused to carry an

                            was also pointed out to the Embassy that on October 1, there were 7,453

                            Shipping Administration as eligible for shipment. This newsprint was
                            consigned to papers selected in accordance with Embassy’s recommendation
                            1684, September 2.<note n="73" xml:id="d405fn75">Not printed.</note> On
                            October 28, Board of Economic Warfare approved over 8,000 tons of
                            newsprint in accordance with Embassy’s 1684. This large amount was
                            approved to make up for possible unshipped or unmanufactured paper from
                            previous months. <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0434"/>Of the total
                            amount, <hi rend="italic">El Mundo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Editorial

                            had 1,245 tons approved. All newsprint applications in excess of 8,000
                            tons have been held up as there is no reason to approve newsprint that
                            would exceed available shipping tonnage to any great extent. It is
                            suggested that the Embassy immediately bring to the attention of the
                            appropriate Argentine Government officials the condition existing with
                            respect to the discrimination by the Flota, The Embassy should point out
                            to the complaining papers that newsprint is being equitably made
                            available for export in so far as United States Government agencies are
                            concerned. The Department now awaits the result of the Embassy’s
                            investigation as to why the Argentine Government is permitting the Flota
                            to discriminate against certain newspapers.</p>

                            <item>Department wishes to make clear that primary objective in present
                                negotiations is to secure effective collaboration of Argentina in
                                the joint effort among republics to insure maximum supply of oil to
                                all republics with limited facilities now available. To this end
                                Department has suggested to other republics particularly those
                                neighboring Argentina that they join in effort to secure such
                                collaboration. Vegh Garzon<note n="76" xml:id="d407fn76">General

                        <p>With regard to Argentina’s apparent reluctance to include discussion of
                            mixed companies in present negotiations the Department wishes to make
                            its views clear. This Government has no intention of negotiating
                            particular contracts between any American interests and Argentina.
                            Before releasing any material for Argentina however it will wish
                            adequate assurance from the Government of Argentina that this material
                            will be used to the best possible advantage in increasing oil production
                            and that some arrangement will be reached through which the American
                            companies can participate in those operations on an equal basis with
                            YPF. The Department understands that under existing laws this can be
                            achieved through the formation of mixed companies which are entitled to
                            drilling rights in government reserved lands. This Government wishes
                            assurance that American companies <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425"
                                facs="0437"/>will not be impeded in their efforts to conclude
                            reasonable agreements under those laws.</p>
                        <p>You understand of course that you are not to commit this Government in
                            any specific way without approval of the Department. Because of the
                            extremely tight material situation here it will be necessary for the
                            Department to have a fairly close estimate of the material involved in
                            the negotiation in order to get assurance of its availability from War
                            Production Board before any commitment is made to the Government of
                            Argentina. It is also important that the quantity of material be held to
                            the absolute minimum.</p>
                        <p>Reports have reached the Department that some arrangement is under
                            discussion in Argentina according to which two Argentine tankers would
                            be chartered indirectly by certain American oil companies and used to
                            supply Argentina in addition to the indigenous production. It seems
                            hardly necessary to point out that any such arrangement would be
                            completely out of order and that any efforts on the part of an American
                            oil company representative to promote such a plan would be regarded most
                            unfavorably by the Department.</p>

                                memorandum<note n="80" xml:id="d408fn80">Memorandum of September 23,
                                not printed.</note> is based upon probable availability of
                            materials. In this respect it differs from the Central Bank schedule.
                            The figure for iron and steel in the Department’s memorandum—5000 tons
                            monthly—is maximum. Figure of 4000 tons of tinplate is also maximum.
                            Inasmuch as the plans worked out with the Flota here were to move 40,000
                            tons of Argentine products to the United States each month, it was
                            necessary for the Department to determine whether it would be possible
                            to provide sufficient United States merchandise to load these boats for
                            the return trip. The schedule contained in the memorandum indicates it
                            is possible, although the distribution may not be according to the
                            Central Bank’s economic desires. The 6500 tons of newsprint is important
                            and it is believed that it is within the Flota’s capabilities to move
                            this amount if the northbound movement ever attains the 40,000–ton
                            level. Of course, drastic measures by the newspapers to reduce their
                            consumption would in turn reduce the necessity of moving 6500 tons a
                            month. The Department <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0438"/>believes
                            such action on the part of the newspapers would be desirable to the
                            extent that it does not interfere with our political desires.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted from the schedule that after iron, steel, tinplate,
                            newsprint and coal allocations have been taken care of, this leaves 7500
                            tons of miscellaneous unallocated commodities, the distribution of which
                            is left up to the Central Bank in accordance with its economic plans.
                            Exceptions could arise where needs of Argentine industries contributing
                            directly to the war effort are involved. Department fully understands
                            the reluctance of the Central Bank and the Flota to provide for more
                            than 1000 tons of newsprint per month. However, you should seek by every
                            means possible to increase the 1000–ton figure of the Central Bank as
                            much as possible, it being understood that the difference between the
                            Central Bank’s allotment and your revised minimum requirements can
                            always be carried on Dodero’s<note n="81" xml:id="d408fn81">A. A.

                            shipments to Argentina on American vessels are effected at a sacrifice
                            to the war effort, as it reduces our ability to supply friendly
                            countries. It is obvious that, while our licensing procedure has been
                            fully explained to you, our control over the movement of a certain
                            portion of the shipping to move newsprint will insure equitable
                            distribution among the friendly Argentine press.</p>
                        <p>Taking into consideration Argentina’s present stocks of tinplate, it
                            appears that 4000 tons per month is excessive and will be sharply
                            reduced. Consequently, the Central Bank will have that extra tonnage to
                            dispose of among what it considers vital unallocated commodities.
                            Naturally, such a reduction will also increase the ability of the Flota
                            to carry the newsprint.</p>

                            authorities covering the purchase of the three Lloyd Argentina ships.
                            Iterman and his Company have now <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0439"
                            />agreed to accept payment in blocked form and the contract provides
                            that all payments will be blocked except approximately 540,000 pesos to
                            be repaid to the Merchant Marine for repairs and other expenses recently
                            incurred and 15,000 pesos to be paid to the Argentine Government for
                            taxes.</p>
                        <p>As in the case of the Danish ships the blocked funds will be released
                            upon the “cessation of hostilities or the concluding of an armistice
                            which will permit the aforementioned vessels to navigate freely”. Upon
                            being requested to do so, Stewart agreed to endeavor to have this clause
                            changed to provide as in the Inter-American ship plan and in the case of
                            the Italian ships for blocking until the end of war. This modification
                            would of course be advantageous in the event of reparations after the
                            war. Stewart has promised to furnish the Embassy with a copy of the
                            contract in time for forwarding in the airmail pouch Monday.</p>
                        <p>He said that he did not know the present status of the Delfino matter and
                            indicated that this was now being handled exclusively in the Foreign
                            Office. The Embassy will discuss the subject there the first part of
                            next week.</p>
                        <p>Stewart said that the <hi rend="italic">Esmeralda</hi> was on its way to
                            Argentina and presumably the list of contemplated payments will be
                            submitted to the Embassy within the next few days.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the payment to the Italian Government for coal and supplies, he
                            reiterated that these funds were being blocked and indicated that the
                            blockade would be in the form provided for in the contract covering the
                            Italian ships.</p>

                                xml:id="d410fn86">Not printed; this telegram gave instructions on
                                the commodities to be loaded in certain specified ships
                                (103.9164/288b).</note> from War Shipping Administration to
                                Gibson<note n="87" xml:id="d410fn87">Ray A. Gibson, Agent of the War
                                Shipping Administration.</note> was delivered upon arrival to Flota
                            Mercante, as Gibson is still in Montevideo. Flota Mercante officials
                            discussed matter with Embassy officers on November 26, and stated that
                            while they would do everything possible to abide by agreement with War
                            Shipping Administration, the loading instructions for December placed
                            the Flota in an awkward position. <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428"
                                facs="0440"/>First, it does not offer “full and down” cargo as
                            mentioned in the agreement. Second, they feel a disproportionately high
                            tonnage has been assigned to zinc concentrates. Since this latter cargo
                            is supplied by one producer only, and since the large tonnage for
                            quebracho is also supplied by a small group, there is relatively little
                            tonnage left to distribute among the country’s major exporting
                            groups.</p>
                        <p>Therefore the Flota Mercante, including the representative of Ministry of
                            Agriculture, has submitted a counterproposal covering 39,250 tons to be
                            transported to New Orleans in December, and the first days of January.
                            This is divided as follows: salted hides 11,500; zinc concentrates
                            4,200; wool 9,600; quebracho extract 7,000; canned meats 2,600; casein
                            1,000; linseed 1,000; tallow 1,000; miscellaneous 1,350. (Agriculture
                            insisted on including linseed and tallow.)</p>
                        <p>The Embassy agrees that the Flota is placed in a difficult position by
                            not carrying cargo which is more evenly distributed among export groups
                            and which would more effectively benefit country’s over-all economy. In
                            view of current protests of present Flota administration from certain
                            official and unofficial circles, and probability that any new Flota
                            administration would be less disposed to cooperate with us, it is
                            believed that we should do anything within reason to help them.
                            Therefore information is requested at earliest opportunity as to whether
                            December loading instructions might be revised more along the lines of
                            Flota’s counterproposal above.<note n="88" xml:id="d410fn88">In telegram

                            Dr. Bosch, Director General of Civil Aeronautics. Dr. Bosch indicated
                            that the company had not yet completed its reorganization under the
                            terms of the decree. Before returning to Rio de Janeiro, Mr. Harding

                            the latter says that a 60-day extension has been recommended. Both of
                            these Argentine officials have expressed the hope, informally, that the
                            inclusion of the Corporación on our Proclaimed List be deferred. While
                            such a reaction might have been expected, it is nevertheless interesting

                            March 10,<note n="95" xml:id="d412fn96">Not printed.</note> reporting an
                            interview with Sr. Antonio <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0442"
                            />Biedma, who recently resigned as the local manager for the
                            Corporación. Sr. Biedma has very strong doubts that the Argentine
                            Government will be able to effect a reorganization of the Corporación in
                            a manner which would actually eliminate the Italian participation, or
                            even reduce it to a minority interest.</p>
                        <p>There are several arguments both for and against placing the Corporación
                            on the Proclaimed List. One of the arguments against such action is the
                            fact that the U.S. apparently is in no position to arrange for a
                            substitute service, as has been done in other cases where pro-Axis
                            airlines were eliminated. In this connection the following paragraph is
                            quoted from a letter dated February 25 from Ambassador Frost at
                            Asunción, regarding the rumored purchase of airplane engines by the
                            Corporación in Paraguay: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The question of the Axis affiliations of the Corporación has
                                    been a vexatious one, and any light which you may be able to
                                    throw upon it will be appreciated. The Corporación’s
                                    representative here, Manuel Ferreira, S.A., is a very large
                                    purely Paraguayan firm which we are disposed to consider
                                    friendly and above suspicion. The Corporación’s service is
                                    greatly needed and greatly appreciated in Asunción. If it
                                    disappears because of lack of new engines, or because of
                                    inclusion in the Proclaimed List, I believe that it may be well
                                    for the general public to have no idea that the result could
                                    have been brought about through our interest.”</p></quote></p>
                        <p>As will be noted in the attached memorandum, the son and the law partner
                            of Acting President Castillo are both connected with the Corporación.
                            Should the company be placed on the Proclaimed List, with the consequent
                            stoppage of gasoline sales by Intava,<note n="98" xml:id="d412fn98"
                                >International Aviation Associates.</note> it is possible that the
                            Acting President would instruct the Argentine company Y.P.F.<note n="99"
                                xml:id="d412fn99">Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales.</note> to
                            supply the Corporación with gasoline henceforth. It will be recalled
                            that several months ago Y.P.F. agreed to supply no more gasoline to
                            airlines on the Proclaimed List, but the inclusion of a nominally
                            Argentine airline on this List might well cause a change in Y.P.F.’s
                            sales policy. Up to this time the Argentine Government has shown little
                            or no formal opposition to the application of Presidential Proclamation
                                2497<note n="1" xml:id="d412fn1">Proclamation Authorizing a

                            the possibility that our black-listing of an Argentine public service
                            might antagonize the Argentine Government in such a manner as to
                            prejudice the smooth operation of the Proclaimed List.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, there seems to be no doubt that the Corporación is
                            controlled by Italian interests, and that should it begin to show a <pb
                                n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0443"/>profit, these funds would go to
                            Fiat Argentina, which is also on the Proclaimed List. According to a
                            report of October 6, 1941, prepared by the former Director General of
                            Civil Aeronautics (and forwarded with Embassy’s confidential despatch
                            no. 3634 of December 3, 1941),<note n="2" xml:id="d412fn2">Neither

                            pesos owing to Ala Littoria and 380,000 pesos to Fiat.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned previously, the company’s present operations constitute
                            little if any threat to hemisphere defense. However, should Brazil
                            decide to sell the Lati<note n="3" xml:id="d412fn3">Lmeas Aéreas
                                Transcontinentales Italianas.</note> planes to the Corporación, or
                            to the Argentine Government, it would permit the establishment of a new
                            service to Kio (competing with Pan American Airways), together with the
                            slight possibility of occasional trips to Italy to obtain replacement
                            parts.</p>
                        <p>Although, as stated above, there is considerable doubt whether the
                            Corporación can be converted into a real Argentine enterprise, the
                            Government is continuing its demands for further changes. For this
                            reason it may be desirable to withhold action for the immediate
                            future.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy is also considering the possibility of approaching the
                            Corporación with a proposal whereby its profits would be blocked for the
                            duration of the war, in return for which it would not be placed on the
                            Proclaimed List. However, such a plan should be contingent on a
                            restriction of the company’s operations to its present routes.</p>

                            strictly confidential telegram no. 428 of March 26, 10 p.m., I have the
                            honor to report two recent conversations with the Brazilian Ambassador,
                            Dr. Rodrigues Alves, regarding Argentine efforts to obtain the Lati
                            planes now in Brazil, and to outline further considerations with respect
                            to the Corporación Sudamericana de Servicios Aéreos.</p>
                        <p>On March 23 the Brazilian Ambassador told me of a recent talk he had had
                            with Dr. Castells, Undersecretary of Interior, who remarked that Dr.
                            Castillo’s elder son, Ramón, had considerable influence with his father;
                            in fact, the Acting President found it difficult to refuse his son
                            anything. Dr. Castells then referred to the desire of Ramón Castillo Jr.
                            to acquire the Lati planes now in Brazil, and said that the planes were
                            needed by Argentina for use on the airline from Buenos Aires to Esquel
                            (now being operated by the army air service), and to maintain
                            communications with isolated army posts along the Chilean frontier.</p>
                        <p>After his talk with Dr. Castells, the Brazilian Ambassador was approached
                            by Ramón Castillo Jr. for the purpose of enlisting the Ambassador’s
                            cooperation in arranging for the purchase of these Lati planes. Dr.
                            Rodrigues Alves replied that he thought all of these planes, with
                            perhaps one exception, were of flimsy wooden construction and hardly
                            suitable for the Argentine army. However, Castillo Jr. still seemed
                            anxious to acquire them, and said that he was also interested in getting
                            five or six transport planes from the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian Ambassador said young Castillo had told him that “a member
                            of the British Embassy” (he could not remember the name Castillo had
                            given him, and was unable to recognize it afterwards on consulting the
                            diplomatic list) had told him that if Argentina would grant
                            nonbelligerent treatment to Great Britain, the British would then use
                            their influence to get these American planes for Argentina. Dr.
                            Rodrigues Alves was very insistent that he had clearly understood young
                            Castillo on this point. However, I have since had the opportunity to
                            discuss this with the British Embassy, which states that the report is
                            “ridiculous”.</p>
                        <p>On March 241 had another talk with the Brazilian Ambassador, and asked
                            him specifically if he thought Argentina intended to use the Lati
                            planes, if they secured them, for a trans-Atlantic service. He replied
                            in the negative, saying that young Castillo had assured him the <pb
                                n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0446"/>planes were intended for army
                            use and on the Esquel line. He also said that the local Fiat company had
                            endeavored to obtain the Lati planes by means of an ante-dated purchase
                            agreement, which Brazil refused to recognize.</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian Ambassador at first seemed favorably disposed to
                            recommending the sale of the Lati planes to Argentina; that they did not
                            amount to much anyway and the Argentine Government had after all
                            permitted the return of the Condor<note n="5" xml:id="d416fn5">For

                            stressed by young Castillo). Furthermore, some reciprocal gesture by
                            Brazil, negotiated by the son of Dr. Castillo, would be highly
                            appreciated by the Acting President.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the American planes desired by young Castillo, Dr.
                            Rodrigues Alves admitted that it would be inconsistent under our
                            Government’s present policy to furnish such equipment to Argentina, but
                            suggested an ingenious solution whereby we might furnish such planes to
                            Brazil and Brazil in turn could release the Lati planes to
                            Argentina.</p>
                        <p>I said that I thought our Government would be against any such
                            arrangement permitting the release of the Lati planes to Argentina,
                            adding that I felt sure the Ambassador would agree that if our
                            Government scrupulously adhered, as it was doing, to the plan to furnish
                            all available supplies to Brazil and other republics which had broken
                            relations with or declared war on the Axis powers, it would seem
                            inconsistent for Brazil on its part to furnish planes to Argentina, even
                            though these were old Lati planes which happened to be within their
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Rodrigues Alves expressed hearty concurrence with this point of view
                            and said he would present it in this light to Dr. Aranha.</p>
                        <p>The above information furnished by the Brazilian Ambassador raises
                            several points for speculation. Bearing in mind that young Castillo is
                            affiliated with the Corporación Sudamericana de Servicios Aéreos, some
                            of the parts and motors from these Lati planes unquestionably would have
                            been used to replace worn out equipment on the company’s present fleet
                            of three Italian “Macchi” planes. Present operations are from Buenos
                            Aires to Montevideo and to Asunción, but there is a possibility of the
                            line being extended to Rio de Janeiro by the Corporación itself or by a
                            new Argentine company.</p>
                        <p>In such event, this extension might be a logical link for the rumored
                            airline between Buenos Aires and Europe. According to the local press,
                            one of the matters to be discussed during the forthcoming visit of the
                            Spanish trade mission is the possibility of an airline connecting <pb
                                n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0447"/>Spain and Argentina. Col.
                            Francisco Iglesias, the Spanish aviator who made an extensive flight in
                            1929, arrived in Buenos Aires on March 24, on his way back to Spain from
                            Lima, where he represented his country at the Fourth Centenary of the
                            Discovery of the Amazon Region. <hi rend="italic">Pampero</hi> of March
                            24 comments as follows: “Although his visit does not have an official
                            character, it would not be surprising if he took advantage of the
                            opportunity to consider the possibility of establishing the projected
                            Madrid-Buenos Aires airline.”</p>
                        <p>The interest of Castillo Jr. in acquiring American transport planes is
                            also significant. There is a rumor to the effect that he would like to
                            merge the Corporación with Aerovias Argentinas, the latter company being
                            recently organized to obtain concessions and operate new air routes in
                            Argentina. As reported in the Embassy’s confidential despatch no. 3542
                            of November 21, 1941,<note n="6" xml:id="d416fn6">Not printed.</note>
                            this company has a strong board of directors, and while it had been
                            understood that most of them were partisans of ex-President Justo, it is
                            just possible that its directors would be willing to cooperate with the
                            Castillo faction, especially if they could make better progress. In this
                            event, the American planes would presumably be intended for domestic and
                            possibly international routes of the rumored Corporación Aerovias
                            consolidation. It is also reported that the Corporación intends to
                            change its name in the near future.</p>
                        <p>With specific reference to the Corporación, there is transmitted herewith
                            a translation of a report<note n="6" xml:id="d416fn8">Not
                                printed.</note> prepared by Sr. Antonio Biedma, the former manager
                            of this company, mentioned in the Embassy’s confidential despatch no.
                            4383 of March 11. Sr. Biedma is highly regarded in local aviation
                            circles, and he is believed to be a trustworthy source of information.
                            His report offers further evidence that the company is directly
                            controlled by Fiat and Ala Littoria, and that the Acting President’s
                            son, as well as his law partner, are closely affiliated with the
                            company.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned in the Embassy’s aforementioned despatch no. 4383, there
                            have been several factors which have restrained the Embassy from
                            recommending the Corporación for the Proclaimed List. To these may be
                            added the possibility of a lawsuit against Intava in the event it is no
                            longer able to supply gasoline, and the disruption of the pooling
                            arrangement between the Corporación and the Uruguayan company Causa<note
                                n="7" xml:id="d416fn7">Compañía Aeronáutica Uruguaya, S.A.</note> on
                            the Buenos Aires–Montevideo daily service.</p>
                        <p>The refusal of Brazil to release the Lati planes materially reduces the
                            threat of expansion by the Corporación. The only other <pb n="436"
                                xml:id="pg_436" facs="0448"/>possibilities apparent at this time for
                            establishing new airlines from Argentina to Brazil and Europe are: 1)
                            utilization of the Air France planes for which Argentina has been
                            negotiating, which would first require considerable overhauling of the
                            planes and the probable employment of former Air France pilots, and 2)
                            the establishment of the proposed Spanish-Argentine line, with planes
                            furnished by Spain, which presumably could be discouraged by withholding
                            fuel.</p>
                        <p>Briefly, the inclusion of the Corporación on the Proclaimed List would
                            probably cause a cessation in operations, provided Intava stopped fuel
                            supplies. However, due to the considerations already mentioned, such
                            action on our part might well cause unpleasant repercussions.</p>
                        <p>The above factors have been outlined in some detail in order to give the
                            Department full background information, and in the event that future
                            developments require quick action with respect to placing the
                            Corporación on the Proclaimed List.</p>

                            strictly confidential telegram no. 594 of April 28, 8 p.m. regarding the
                            possible inclusion of the above named company on the Proclaimed List,
                            and to the Embassy’s telegraphic reply no. 811 of May 2, 3 p.m.,<note

                            to report the following additional information.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Grant Mason Jr. of the Defense Supplies Corporation arrived in Buenos
                            Aires on the afternoon of April 29 on his way to the United States, and
                            left for Rio de Janeiro on the morning of May 1. In company with Mr.
                            Thomas D. Park<note n="11" xml:id="d419fn11">Representative of the
                                Defense Supplies Corporation.</note> and Asst. Commercial Attaché
                            Walstrom, he conferred on April 30 with Dr. Samuel Bosch, director of
                            civil aeronautics, in order to discuss American technical assistance in
                            developing an Argentine civil flying program (referred to in Embassy’s
                            confidential despatch no. 4870 of April 27<note n="12" xml:id="d419fn12"
                                >Not printed.</note>). At this meeting Dr. Bosch stated his desire
                            to have Mr. Park remain here to help establish an advanced flying
                            school, and also agreed that one or two more American advisers should be
                            obtained, if possible, for a period of one to two months. (See Embassy’s
                            confidential despatch no. 4933 of May 2.)<note n="12" xml:id="d419fn13"

                        <p>The placing of the Corporación on the Proclaimed List would not be in
                            harmony with our efforts to assist in the general development of
                            Argentine flying. Consequently, the opportunity was taken to inform Dr.
                            Bosch that the airline was still being seriously considered for listing.
                            However, the possible embarrassment or difficulties arising therefrom
                            apparently were not considered serious enough by Dr. Bosch for him to
                            withdraw his request for continued assistance from Mr. Park and other
                            advisers.</p>
                        <p>Apropos of the 60-day extension granted to the Corporación for improving
                            its situation, Dr. Bosch was questioned as to what progress <pb n="438"
                                xml:id="pg_438" facs="0450"/>had been made recently. He asked
                            Messrs. Mason and Walstrom to return to his clinic that evening, when he
                            would show them a report submitted on this subject by the Corporación to
                            the Bureau of Civil Aeronautics. It was agreed that it might be
                            advisable to invite Dr. Ramón Castillo Jr., son of the Acting President
                            who is affiliated with the company, to this meeting for a frank
                            discussion, but it developed that he was out of the city.</p>
                        <p>The Corporación report shown to Messrs. Mason and Walstrom by Dr. Bosch
                            outlined the claims of this company as to the manner in which it had
                            complied with the Government’s requirements, as set forth in the
                            official decree of December 22, 1941, wherein the airline’s concession
                            was revised and the Government made stipulations regarding nationality
                            of personnel and improvement of the company’s financial situation. A
                            translation of this decree was given in the Embassy’s report no. 789 of
                            January 22 (“Argentine Aviation Notes”).<note n="14" xml:id="d419fn14"

                        <p>Article VII, paragraph 2, of this decree reads as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The president of the board of directors of the company, at least
                                    two-thirds of the members or administrators and the manager,
                                    should be native or naturalized Argentines with a minimum of ten
                                    years citizenship.”</p></quote></p>
                        <p>The Corporatión’s report, which apparently was submitted during the first
                            part of April, gave the following revised list of the board of
                            directors: <list>
                                <item>Carlos Rueda, president (Argentine);</item>
                                <item>Ricardo C. Cranwell, 1st vice-president (Argentine);</item>
                                <item>Ramón Castillo Jr., 2nd vice-president (Argentine);</item>
                                <item>Roberto Magugliani (Italian);</item>
                                <item>Carlos Menendez Behety Jr. (Argentine);</item>

                                <item>Enrique Lorenzo Mira (Argentine);</item>
                                <item>Pierre Colin Jeannel (French);</item>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>Dr. Bosch said that the above complied with the Argentine requirements as
                            to nationality, but that he was suspicious that the two foreigners,
                            Magugliani and Jeannel, exerted an abnormal amount of influence in the
                            company’s operations, and that he was considering the appointment of a
                            supervisory commission to make sure that the Corporación was
                            administered as a truly Argentine company. Attention is invited to the
                            enclosure forwarded with the Embassy’s confidential despatch no. 4600 of
                            March 27, where it is mentioned that the majority of the directors is
                            either affiliated directly with Fiat or else connected with that
                            company’s firm of legal advisers.</p>

                        <p>Article VII, paragraph 3, of the aforementioned decree reads as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The company shall proceed within the period of 60 days from the

                                    up its financial situation through the elimination of its

                                    amended the statutes to increase the capital under the following
                                    conditions: the new investments shall be effected through the
                                    issuance of nominative shares, intransferable without
                                    authorization of the Executive Power, whose subscribers, in the
                                    proportion necessary to constitute an absolute majority of the
                                    whole of the firm’s capital, should be native or naturalized
                                    Argentines with more than 10 years citizenship. Excess shares
                                    shall be taken up only by stock companies or private individuals
                                    residing in the country.”</p></quote></p>
                        <p>The Corporación’s report said that at the stockholders’ meeting of last
                            December 23, it had been resolved to reduce the capital by 70 percent,
                            which would conform with stipulation “a” in paragraph 3, Article VII, of
                            the December 22 decree, since the balance sheet as of September 30,
                            1941, is understood to have shown a loss of about 585,000 pesos, and the
                            capitalization at that time was approximately 815,000 pesos.</p>
                        <p>The Corporación’s report also said that on March 28 it had been decided
                            to issue two new stock series of 10,000 shares each with a value of 30
                            pesos per share, in order to raise the company’s capitalization to its
                            previous level. (Mr. Mason suggested the possibility that the new
                            capital subscribed might be used to pay off some of the debt to Fiat and
                            Ala Littoria.) The report likewise showed a list of stockholders, and
                            the number of shares held by each. Of a total 27, 166 shares of stock,
                            18,593 or 68.44 percent were held by Argentine citizens, whereas the
                            balance was held by companies and individuals not necessarily Argentine.
                            This also appears to conform with stipulation “b” in paragraph 3,
                            Article VII, quoted above. The list showed that Fiat held a relatively
                            small block of shares, although Dr. Bosch admitted confidentially that
                            it would be possible for Fiat to make fictitious stock transfers to
                            individuals.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, in referring to its compliance with other stipulations of
                            the decree, the Corporación mentioned that its insurance had been placed
                            with British Aviation Insurance Company Ltd. and Aviation &amp; General
                            Insurance Company Ltd., 3–4 Lime St., London.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the Argentine authorities are endeavoring to make the
                            Corporación as Argentine as possible, and that certain progress has been
                            made. It is also evident that Dr. Bosch himself is quite sincere.
                            However, he admitted that it was difficult for him to effect a complete
                            elimination of Italian influence. The Corporación having ostensibly
                            complied with the stipulations in the December 22 decree, and a notable
                            improvement having been effected in the company’s <pb n="440"
                                xml:id="pg_440" facs="0452"/>financial situation and in the
                            elimination of practically all non-Argentine personnel, it might be
                            difficult for Dr. Bosch to make further demands without antagonizing the
                            friends of the Acting President affiliated with the company.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, it was pointed out to Dr. Bosch that the Corporación
                            apparently was still heavily indebted to Fiat and Ala Littoria, and that
                            the primary interest of at least some of the directors would be in
                            liquidating this obligation to the Italians. Dr. Bosch thought he could
                            demand that this not be done, and that whatever earnings accrued under
                            the revised concession should be used for improving the service and not
                            for paying off questionable commitments incurred previously. Mr. Mason
                            mentioned that when he was a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board, this
                            principle had also been followed in certain cases involving U. S.
                            subsidies to American airlines.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Bosch was told that while the inclusion of the Corporación on the
                            Proclaimed List might still be considered necessary, some consideration
                            would be given to an arrangement whereby the Corporación would agree to
                            the freezing of its debt to the Italian interests, and the blocking of
                            any profits which might find their way into pro-Axis hands. Dr. Bosch
                            seemed to think that this would be a good solution, and it was the
                            general impression that, should this meet with the approval of
                            Washington, such a proposal would be made to the Corporación by the
                            Embassy.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Bosch was not fully familiar with certain aspects of the
                            Corporación’s reorganization, and as stated above, he further admitted
                            that it might be possible for the company to effect fictitious stock
                            transfers. However, if the company is willing to consider the blocking
                            of its funds, it is believed that this would offer the Embassy an
                            opportunity to demand full details as to its finances.</p>
                        <p>Previous despatches (Nos. 4383 and 4600 of March 11 and 27) have outlined
                            the reasons for not taking definite action against the Corporación up to
                            the present time. To recapitulate, the principal restraining factors are
                            as follows: <list>
                                <label><hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Both the son and the law partner of the Acting President are
                                    directors of the company, and the placing of the airline on the
                                    Proclaimed List might antagonize the Argentine authorities and
                                    prejudice the heretofore satisfactory operation of the
                                    Proclaimed List in Argentina.</item>
                                <label><hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>It is generally conceded that present operations of the line
                                    constitute little or no threat to hemisphere defense. It offers
                                    a public service to Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, and if it
                                    is forced to suspend operations due to inability to get
                                    gasoline, apparently we are in no position to offer a substitute
                                    service, as we have done in other countries.</item>

                        <p>Under normal circumstances the Embassy would have recommended the
                            inclusion of this firm on the Proclaimed List. Due, however, to the
                            above mentioned considerations, it is felt that other possible solutions
                            should be explored before taking final action. Consequently, my telegram
                            no. 811 of May 2, 3 p.m.,<note n="16" xml:id="d419fn16">Not

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With regard to the above subject, I have
                            the honor to refer to the Embassy’s telegram no. 964 of May 22 [<hi
                                rend="italic">21</hi>], 9 p.m.<note n="16" xml:id="d420fn16">Not
                                printed.</note> (a copy of which was sent to the Embassy at Rio de
                            Janeiro), and to transmit herewith further information.</p>
                        <p>The telegram sent on May 16, 7 p.m., from the Embassy at Rio de Janeiro
                            to this Embassy stated that Dr. Bento Ribeiro Dantas of the reorganized
                            Condor company was desirous of discharging all persons in Condor’s
                            employ whom we considered undesirable, and that he would shortly consult
                            this Embassy on the matter.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Dantas called on the Counselor of the Embassy on May 19, and promised
                            to furnish that same afternoon a revised list of the Condor personnel in
                            Argentina. At that time he said he would return on May 22 to obtain
                            whatever opinion we might offer as to any of his employees. His second
                            visit was on May 21, at which time he brought a list of personnel, and
                            said that he would probably be returning to Rio de Janeiro on the
                            following morning, unless last minute developments postponed his
                            departure. It was subsequently learned that he did not leave; as
                            mentioned below, he paid a further visit to the Embassy today.</p>
                        <p>According to the revised payroll furnished by Dr. Dantas on May 21,
                            approximately 38 employees have been discharged within the past few
                            months, practically all of them being Germans. There are about 15 German
                            and Italian employees remaining, and Dr. Dantas says that within a short
                            time most of these will also be discharged, as soon as satisfactory
                            replacements could be trained.</p>
                        <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0454"/>
                        <p>It was pointed out to Dr. Dantas that it was obviously his primary
                            concern to see that any dangerous or suspicious employees were weeded
                            out of his new organization, and that he and his company would be the
                            first to suffer if there continued to be a possibility of sabotage or
                            German control. He stated that he realized his responsibility in this
                            connection, and that he was fairly well satisfied with the progress
                            which had been made so far. While up to this time the Embassy has been
                            unable to obtain any detailed information on the remaining personnel
                            employed at the Quilmes airport, we did raise some question as to
                            several officers in the administrative department …</p>
                        <p>[Here follows report on four employees.]</p>
                        <p>On his visit to the Embassy today, Dr. Dantas supplied further
                            information regarding the general Condor situation. He says the
                            Brazilian Government is anxious for his company to extend services to
                            Buenos Aires (but not to Santiago) as soon as possible and, in fact, the
                            former Argentine Ambassador to Brazil, Dr. Labougle, had expressed the
                            same desire to President Vargas. However, the Argentine Government has
                            not yet given formal approval for the renewal of this service.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Dantas saw the Minister of the Interior, Dr. Culaciati, yesterday,
                            and during the course of the conversation there was a reference to the
                            four Condor planes which had been grounded at Quilmes airport when the
                            airline suspended service last December. It will be recalled (Embassy’s
                            strictly confidential despatch no. 4600 of March 27) that Argentina
                            reluctantly permitted these planes to be returned to Brazil, and three
                            of them were flown back, leaving one here. Dr. Culaciati inferred to Dr.
                            Dantas that the release of these planes was conditioned on the
                            acquisition by Argentina of the Lati planes now grounded in Brazil, but
                            Dr. Dantas denied that there was such an understanding, at least as far
                            as he was concerned.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Culaciati then referred to the Condor shops at Quilmes. Dr. Dantas
                            informed the Embassy today that the former Lufthansa officials were
                            endeavoring to convince the Argentine army that it should expropriate
                            these shops for Argentina, in which case Dantas thought that the Germans
                            formerly employed by Condor would again be given employment. Dr. Dantas
                            thinks there is a definite possibility that Condor will lose its Quilmes
                            shops, possibly as a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> for permission
                            for Condor to resume its service to Buenos Aires. Apropos of this, he
                            said he made somewhat the following statement to Dr. Culaciati: “When
                            Condor was under German control, and many Germans were employed,
                            Argentina never thought of taking over the Quilmes shops. It seems
                            strange that you should want to do this when we have reorganized our
                            company, and have replaced the former German personnel with
                            Argentines.”</p>
                        <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0455"/>
                        <p>Dr. Dantas believes that Ramón Castillo Jr. is still working behind the
                            scenes in connection with Argentine airline pretensions, and that it is
                            not impossible that some form of combination with the Spanish airline
                            Iberia is being contemplated. However, he had no concrete information on
                            this possibility.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Dantas is remaining in Buenos Aires for a few days longer, in the
                            hope of getting a definite answer from the Argentine authorities
                            regarding resumption of service. With regard to the general problem of
                            replacing undesirable personnel, the Embassy believes that he has
                            proceeded in a fairly expeditious manner considering the circumstances,
                            and that he might have to make a temporary compromise in keeping a few
                            of the questionable employees on the payroll, at least until adequate
                            substitutes can be found.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s opinion would be appreciated as to whether Intava would
                            be licensed to furnish gasoline to Condor in the event it obtains
                            Argentine permission to resume service to Buenos Aires, and whether the
                            complete elimination of all German and Italian employees is a necessary
                            prerequisite to obtaining gasoline from Intava.</p>

                        <p>With regard to the <hi rend="italic">Berliner Boersenzeitung</hi> report
                            that Argentine pilots would be used between Buenos Aires and Natal, it
                            is questionable whether Brazil would permit Argentine pilots to fly any
                            further north than Rio de Janeiro. It is believed that this latter
                            privilege would also be conditioned on Argentine permission for a
                            Brazilian airline, such as Condor, to resume service to Argentina. As
                            mentioned previously, there has been some talk that Brazilian and
                            Argentine airlines would effect a junction at Posadas, in the
                            northeastern part of Argentina, <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0456"

                            in this connection.</p>
                        <p>Apart from the periodic rumors as to secret arrivals of long-distance
                            Axis planes in South America, the reported movement of former Lati
                            employees from Brazil to Argentina (see confidential despatches nos.

                            credence to the possibility that plans for a new South Atlantic air

                        <p>In any event, it is assumed that the U. S. control over gasoline, coupled

                            still maintains coy attitude and has not yet formally approached

                        <p>1532. Intava Company received visit from Colonel Borges, Brazilian Air
                            Attaché, who said his Government instructed him to arrange for monthly
                            purchases of 10,000 sues [<hi rend="italic">liters?</hi>] 87-octane
                            aviation gasoline for delivery to Condor Airline in Buenos Aires. Intava
                            understands Condor intends to reopen weekly service between Brazil and
                            Argentina as soon as fuel arrangements made. Borges admitted he would
                            have to approach YPF if refused by Intava in which event Embassy
                            believes YPF will agree to supply. Intava replied it would need written
                            Embassy permission before supplying Condor. Borges suggested Ambassador
                            Caffery be consulted if we referred matter to the Department.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Embassy’s despatch No. 5225 May 28, it is believed that
                            a few Germans and Italians are still on local Condor payroll. Embassy
                            will endeavor to secure further information tomorrow. With reference to

                        <p>1553. Embassy’s 1532, August 7, 6 p.m. Ribeiro Dantas, president of
                            Condor Airline, now visiting Buenos Aires says Argentine Government
                            willing to pay 4 million pesos for Condor shops and <pb n="446"
                                xml:id="pg_446" facs="0458"/>installations at Buenos Aires Quilmes
                            airport and that he will accept this offer. Presumably Argentine Army
                            will take over former Condor technical personnel at Quilmes including
                            some Germans recently discharged by Condor. Dantas says Condor had
                            Argentine permit valid until end of the year for service to Buenos
                            Aires, with provision for further study of proposed Argentine-Brazilian
                            mixed company. He thinks latter will not materialize.</p>
                        <p>Above development will leave Condor with only administrative personnel
                            and small maintenance staff in Argentina. Dantas claims all local
                            personnel now Argentine.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned Embassy’s 1532, participation of Borges is in effect a sale
                            to the Brazilian Government, probably making it difficult for YPF to
                            refuse to sell in the event Intava not authorized to do so. If Intava is
                            granted permission to supply Borges or Condor, suggest that this be on
                            month to month basis.</p>
                        <p>There remains question of traffic control. Understanding with Condor as
                            to undesirable aliens and merchandise would be advisable. Embassy would
                            also require copy of passenger lists. Should these points be negotiated
                            here for Argentina or in Rio de Janeiro for company as a whole?</p>
                        <p>An early reply for Intava regarding gasoline would be appreciated.</p>

                                xml:id="d427fn24">Not printed.</note> The Embassy is informed by the

                            cause of a prohibition on the shipment of more Ethyl to Argentina. To

                            estimate of the effect of cutting off Standard’s supplies, the Embassy

                                <item>Standard is now using approximately three drums of Ethyl
                                    aviation fluid per month, and therefore will be out of stock
                                    about the end of November.</item>

                                <item>This will leave Y.P.F. as the only source of aviation gasoline
                                    in Argentina, which will force Corporación, Condor, Aeroposta,
                                    and all other local business, into Y.P.F. hands, and take away
                                    from the United States any possible means of exerting pressure
                                    because of control of the fuel source.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>Since Y.P.F. have only 27 drums of Ethyl fluid available for
                                    civilian use, and are consuming five drums monthly for current
                                    military consumption, it might be that the military authorities
                                    would refuse to permit Y.P.F. to deplete their stocks by the
                                    additional two drums monthly needed for Pan American. This
                                    action would make it unnecessary to draw upon Army reserves
                                    until about February, 1943, but it would ground Pan American
                                    planes.</item>

                                <item>There is the possibility that Standard’s stock of codimer
                                    blending fluid might be requisitioned by Y.P.F. when Standard’s
                                    Ethyl supplies are exhausted, on the ground that only Y.P.F. had
                                    facilities for making aviation fuel. This would make Standard
                                    unable to furnish 100 octane fuel for United States purposes if
                                    required because of an emergency.</item>

                                <item>A by-product of this situation would be the elimination of
                                    Intava from the market, which would strengthen Y.P.F.’s efforts
                                    toward securing a petroleum monopoly.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The 86 drums of Ethyl fluid now held by Y.P.F. would last for 17 months,
                            at the present rate of use. The addition of three drums a month to the
                            consumption, to cover Standard’s present production, would exhaust the
                            stocks in 10 months. This difference of 7 months seems to the Embassy
                            scarcely sufficient to compensate for the political and other damage to
                            the United States which might result through cutting off all further
                            supplies of Ethyl fluid to the Standard Oil Company. As you know, their
                            aviation gasoline output is sold through Intava and goes only to
                            consumers approved by the United States.</p>

                                printed.</note> I have the honor to report certain information
                            relative to the resumption of operations by Servicios Aéreos Condor.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to information previously obtained and reported in the Embassy’s
                            aforementioned telegram no. 1792 of September 16, there was no inaugural
                            southbound service from Rio to Buenos Aires on September 16. However, a
                            Brazilian Junkers Ju–52 plane which accompanied the plane bringing
                            General Justo to Buenos Aires on September 12 was used to make the first
                            northbound trip from here to Rio de Janeiro on September 17. The first
                            Condor southbound plane from Rio, a four-motored Focke-Wulf, arrived
                            here yesterday afternoon with 24 passengers and returned to Rio today
                            with one passenger. The plane arrived at and departed from the “Moron”
                            airport (regularly used by Pan American Airways System) instead of using
                            the former Condor field at Quilmes. About a week ago the Director of
                            Civil Aeronautics, Dr. Bosch, asked the local Pan American <pb n="449"
                                xml:id="pg_449" facs="0461"/>Airways office if Condor could use the
                            American company’s ground facilities, which request was refused.</p>
                        <p>The Focke-Wulf plane was refueled from drums which bore the markings of
                            Intava and West India, both Standard Oil subsidiaries. However, Intava
                            states that it has not supplied any gasoline to Condor in drums for a
                            long time, and that these drums were either from old emergency stocks
                            which Condor formerly maintained at interior points in Argentina, or
                            else Condor obtained empty drums in the market and filled them from its
                            underground tanks at Quilmes.</p>
                        <p>Intava estimates that Condor had from 10,000 to 15,000 liters of 87
                            octane gasoline in its Quilmes tanks when service was suspended last
                            December, but part of this was used up in getting the four Condor planes
                            back to Brazil.</p>
                        <p>There is also a good probability that the 7,400 liters of gasoline
                            requested from Intava by the Brazilian Air Attaché, and referred to in
                            my telegrams 1623 of August 24,6 p.m., and 1815 of September 19, 11
                                a.m.,<note n="27" xml:id="d429fn27">Neither printed.</note> will be
                            turned over to Condor. These transactions involve the replenishment of
                            gasoline used by three Brazilian planes for their return trips to
                            Brazil, and such quantities would have been ample to carry them all the
                            way to Rio de Janeiro. However, if the present Condor service refuels at
                            Porto Alegre northbound, the 7,400 liters will probably allow six to
                            eight trips from Buenos Aires to Porto Alegre.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, this Embassy believes that it would be difficult to refuse
                            permission to Intava to deliver the 7,400 liters, since the request came
                            not from Condor but from the Brazilian Military Air Attaché, and with
                            payment to be made by the Brazilian Ministry of Aeronautics. In the
                            words of Intava, it “represents a business deal between our interests
                            and a friendly power.”</p>
                        <p>Apart from any Intava gasoline stocks which Condor has been able to
                            accumulate at Quilmes, there are recent reports to the effect that
                            Condor has been obtaining gasoline from the official Argentine petroleum
                            company Y.P.F. The Military Attaché of this Embassy advises that a
                            Y.P.F. truck visited the Quilmes airport on September 10 and stayed for
                            40 minutes, presumably to fill one or more underground tanks. There have
                            been other reports to the effect that previous deliveries were also made
                            by Y.P.F. The Brazilian Air Attaché intimated to Mr. Petrognani of
                            Intava that Dr. Laspiur, the present Condor general manager in
                            Argentina, had approached Y.P.F. on the matter of gasoline supplies,
                            although the results of such negotiations are not known. Dr. Laspiur is
                            also a lawyer and is understood to have as a partner the legal adviser
                            to Y.P.F., so it is quite possible that he made such an approach.</p>
                        <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0462"/>
                        <p>The Embassy’s report no. 1340 of September 9<note n="28"
                                xml:id="d429fn28">Not printed.</note> gave the text of the Argentine
                            decree authorizing Condor to resume service to Argentina. In the
                            confidential section of this report mention was made of certain
                            “conditions and obligations” which are to be complied with by the end of
                            this year. Dr. Ernesto Pueyrredon, managing director of the domestic
                            airline Aeroposta Argentina, recently told a member of the Embassy staff
                            that in addition to the two major conditions referred to in our report
                            (formation of a joint Argentine-Brazilian airline, and sale to the
                            Argentine army of the Condor shops and ground installations at Quilmes)
                            it was his understanding that Condor also is to furnish proof to the
                            Argentine Government that it is now a purely Brazilian company, and that
                            it will relinquish any future plans to extend its line to Chile. (Dr.
                            Pueyrredon also said that each Condor plane returning to Rio over the
                            past several months carried out some extra equipment, which actually
                            belonged to Aeroposta instead of Condor.)</p>
                        <p>The Department’s telegram no. 1423 of September 22 indicates the
                            possibility that Condor will be removed from the Proclaimed List after
                            the arrival in Rio de Janeiro of Messrs. Royce and Duncan,<note n="29"
                                xml:id="d429fn29">Alexander B. Royce and Francis L. Duncan,
                                representatives of the Federal Loan Agency.</note> which
                            incidentally brings up the question of the Condor personnel in
                            Argentina. This matter was discussed in detail in the Embassy’s strictly
                            confidential despatch no. 5225 of May 28, which also requested the
                            Department’s view on the matter. During his latest visit to Buenos Aires
                            in August, the president of Condor, Dr. Ribeiro Dantas, stated that all
                            non-Argentine personnel in his local administrative staff had been
                            discharged and that while there were a few Germans still employed at the
                            Quilmes airport, these would be replaced “as soon as possible”—at any
                            rate they would pass from the employ of Condor as soon as the Argentine
                            army took over the Quilmes shops.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy’s above mentioned despatch no. 5225 of May 28 raised some
                            doubt as to four employees in the administrative section: …</p>
                        <p>[Here follows report that two of the employees had been discharged, one
                            sent on a mission to Chile for Condor, and that information available on
                            the fourth was inadequate to warrant his inclusion on the Proclaimed
                            List.]</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the matter of gasoline supplies for Condor, it will be
                            recalled that Y.P.F. officials have informed the Embassy on several
                            occasions that the company would not sell to firms on the Proclaimed
                            List. However, for reasons outlined below, we have not discussed the
                            Condor matter with Y.P.F. at this time.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, Y.P.F. would probably justify its action (assuming
                            that it is really making deliveries) on the grounds that Condor <pb
                                n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0463"/>is now a Brazilian company.
                            Also, there is not much use in making an issue of its dealings with
                            Condor at this time if the latter is to be removed from the Proclaimed
                            List in the near future—Y.P.F. would only think that we were trying to
                            save the business for Intava.</p>
                        <p>Until the Condor matter is definitely clarified, the Embassy also
                            hesitates to threaten Y.P.F. with non-delivery of materials from the
                            U.S. Such a move on our part would end immediately the negotiations now
                            being conducted relative to Argentine petroleum for Uruguay and
                            Paraguay, involving the delivery of production equipment to Y.P.F.
                            Furthermore, if Washington continues to refuse export permits on ethyl
                            fluid for Argentina (see Embassy’s airgram A–196 of September 16, 4
                            p.m.), it is quite possible that Pan American Airways System itself will
                            have to ask Y.P.F. for gasoline. Whether Y.P.F. would be willing to
                            supply is open to some doubt, especially if we force them to stop
                            selling to Condor.</p>
                        <p>It is also apparent that the Brazilian Government is anxious for the new
                            service to continue operating, and that the Argentine Government will be
                            disposed to cooperate, at least until the end of the year when the
                            present Condor decree expires.</p>
                        <p>Although the Department, in its telegram 1423 of September 22, indicates
                            that it does not look with favor on the resumption of Condor service to
                            Buenos Aires, or the provision of gasoline in this connection, the fact
                            is that the line is already operating and probably will obtain its
                            future gasoline supplies from Y.P.F. This is an unfavorable reflection
                            on the effectiveness of our Proclaimed List. If Condor is delisted, the
                            Embassy does not see how the company could be prevented from obtaining
                            gasoline. If it is kept on the list, it is believed that the factors
                            outlined in the preceding paragraphs should be considered before we
                            attempt to persuade Y.P.F. not to make any further gasoline sales to
                            this company.</p>

                        <p>1880. The removal from the Proclaimed List of Condor Brazil does not
                            remove Condor Argentina, which will be handled on its own merits.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, Intava should continue deliveries of supplies to Condor
                            Argentina on individual flight basis, unless deliveries are made direct
                            to “Cruzeiro do Sul” successor to Condor Brazil, in which case, if you
                            are satisfied, there need be no restrictions on Intava deliveries.</p>
                        <p>If circumstances warrant, the Department will present the case for
                            delisting Condor Argentina to the Interdepartmental Committee. In the
                            event you recommend this procedure you should submit full information

                                >cciv</hi>, p. 386.</note> I stated that, as he knew, the United
                            States Government attached great importance to this financial and
                            economic resolution and that it was naturally very interested regarding
                            the steps that would be taken by Argentina.</p>

                        <p>I then referred to Argentina’s reservation to the resolution<note n="33"

                                1942, p. 140.</note> and said that it was not altogether clear to me
                            how the second sentence of the reservation should be interpreted. More
                            specifically, I asked whether the sentence meant that Argentina would
                            apply future measures only “to firms or enterprises managed or
                            controlled by Axis or foreign belligerent countries not in the American
                            continent.” Dr. Prebisch said that this was not at all the case, that he
                            had drafted the reservation himself and that its purpose was to have the
                            Argentine Government “for political reasons” on record as contemplating
                            the possibility of applying the economic and financial measures not only
                            to the Axis countries but also to other non-American belligerent
                            countries. When I inquired whether it was therefore to be inferred that
                            Argentina had undertaken to assume all the obligations under Resolution
                            V, the reservation pertaining only to additional applications, Dr.
                            Prebisch replied in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>Turning to another matter, I said that it had been gratifying that
                            largely through the good offices of Dr. Prebisch and conversations that
                            the Embassy had had the Banco de la Provincia and the Banco de
                            Avellaneda had adopted measures providing for greater cooperation with
                            the democracies. I said that this cooperation, however, as well as the
                            cooperation on the part of a substantial number of banks in Buenos
                            Aires, was being neutralized by the fact that certain other
                            institutions, including the Banco de la Nación, were continuing to have
                            relations with black-listed firms and individuals and were, in fact,
                            accepting business which the other banks turned down, besides engaging
                            in other transactions inconsistent with policies pursued by the United
                            States. I stated that the Ambassador was frankly disturbed about this
                            and that before reporting to the authorities in Washington the part
                            being played by the Banco de la Nación, the Embassy thought that
                            possibly some understanding could be reached with that institution along
                            the lines of the understandings reached <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455"
                                facs="0467"/>with the Banco de la Provincia and the Banco de
                            Avellaneda. Dr. Prebisch quickly volunteered to have a conversation in
                            the matter with Dr. Jorge A. Santamarina, the president of the Bank.</p>
                        <p>After referring to previous conversations in regard to negotiations for a
                            new French payments agreement, I asked Dr. Prebisch whether the
                            negotiations were still in the state of suspense. Dr. Prebisch answered
                            in the affirmative and later said that there was no intention to resume
                            the negotiations. I said that that was welcome news inasmuch as there
                            was some fear that Axis activities here might be financed through French
                            francs.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I referred to the widespread practice here of making payments to
                            and from the Axis countries through Switzerland and said that although
                            we had heard encouraging reports shortly after the adoption of the
                            measure on December 22, which purported to render it more difficult to
                            make payments in this way, more recent reports had been of a less
                            encouraging character. Dr. Prebisch said that Mr. Walter Simon<note

                            made the same comment and he (Dr. Prebisch) said that he had promised to
                            look into this matter to see what further action might be taken.</p>

                        <p>I called by appointment upon Dr. Prebisch again today and began by
                            referring to <hi rend="italic">El Pampero</hi> and other agencies of
                            Nazi propaganda in Argentina. I stated that the Ambassador had mentioned
                            this subject informally at the Foreign Office once or twice but felt
                            reluctant to make formal representation because of the long-established
                            policy of the United States with respect to freedom of the press. It had
                            occurred to the Embassy, I said, that perhaps an approach to the problem
                            would be through the Central Bank, especially with reference to the
                            Executive Decree No. 110,790 of January 8, 1942, which subjects to the
                            control of the Central Bank “transfers of funds abroad and internal
                            movements of funds which may have a direct or indirect relation to such
                            transfers by firms or enterprises managed or controlled by persons who
                            have the nationality of a country at war or are domiciled in it.” In
                            this connection, I referred to the recent report of the Congressional
                            committee investigating subversive activities in <pb n="456"
                                xml:id="pg_456" facs="0468"/>Argentina, which made it clear that <hi
                                rend="italic">El Pampero</hi> and other Nazi papers and news
                            agencies were receiving financial support from the German Embassy and
                            from sources in Germany, and I said that it was well known that a large
                            number of copies of <hi rend="italic">El Pampero</hi> were being
                            distributed gratis to members of the Argentine armed forces and to
                            government employees as a part of the Nazi propaganda system.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Prebisch said that he felt entirely in accord with the Embassy in
                            respect to the unsavory nature of <hi rend="italic">El Pampero</hi> as
                            well as its detrimental influence upon relations between the two
                            countries and stated that he had given considerable thought to what
                            might be done in the matter. Over a year ago, he said, he had informed
                            the Embassy of the source of the newsprint supply of <hi rend="italic"
                                >El Pampero</hi>, and he indicated that our Government had evidently
                            not taken steps to cut off this supply.<note n="35" xml:id="d437fn35"
                                >For correspondence on the newsprint problem, see <ref
                                    target="#pg_400">pp. 400</ref>–<ref target="#pg_428">428</ref>,
                                    <hi rend="italic">passim</hi>.</note> I commented that this
                            aspect of the matter had been under constant study by the Embassy and by
                            the authorities in Washington, but that the newsprint problem was a very
                            involved and difficult one. Dr. Prebisch then said that the application
                            of any financial action against <hi rend="italic">El Pampero</hi> would
                            have to be initiated by the Argentine Government, and when asked whether
                            the decree aforecited did not furnish sufficient authorization to go
                            ahead, he said that he was afraid not. Dr. Prebisch stated that his
                            suggestion would be that the Embassy hold the matter in abeyance until
                            after the elections in March and then take it up with the Foreign
                            Office.</p>
                        <p>… I said that the Ambassador had informally inquired at the Foreign
                            Office concerning Argentine action on the various resolutions of the
                                conference<note n="35a" xml:id="d437fn35a">i.e., the Third Meeting
                                of the Foreign Ministers of the American Republics, held at Rio de
                                Janeiro January 15–28, 1942.</note> and had been informed that they
                            had been referred to Dr. Ruiz Moreno<note n="36" xml:id="d437fn36"
                                >Isidro Ruiz Moreno, Legal Adviser to the Ministry for Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> for an opinion as to whether it was necessary to
                            submit them to Congress for approval. I added that the Ambassador did
                            not, however, feel disposed to make representations concerning
                            Resolution V, largely because he felt that it was assumed that Argentina
                            would take the appropriate action in accordance with its commitments
                            under Resolution V.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the question whether it was likely that Great Britain would
                            be placed in the same category as the Axis countries in any forthcoming
                            decree in connection with Resolution V, Dr. Prebisch stated that
                            probably all non-American belligerents would be placed in the same
                            general classification, as in the decree of January 8, but that as a
                            practical matter the measure would apply only to the Axis countries.</p>
                        <p>I then referred to the relations of the Banco de la Nación Argentina with
                            the Axis countries, (which I had also discussed with Dr. Prebisch <pb
                                n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0469"/>on February 9, 1942) and after
                            reminding Dr. Prebisch that he had said that he would welcome such
                            pertinent information on this and other matters as the Embassy might be
                            able to supply, I said that it had come to the attention of the Embassy
                            that about the middle of last December the Banco de la Nación had
                            executed a payments order by the Reichsbank of Berlin for approximately
                            190,000 pesos. When I said that this may have been for the German
                            Embassy or for propaganda organizations here, Dr. Prebisch said that
                            under a new regulation, the German, Italian and Japanese Embassies were
                            being limited to 200,000 pesos per month for their peso requirements. He
                            said that it would be very difficult for those Embassies to receive more
                            than that amount through banks here. However, when I suggested that
                            perhaps the Embassies could receive pesos through the accounts of others
                            and through peso notes delivered at the Embassy, Dr. Prebisch admitted
                            that that would be a possibility. He promised, nevertheless, to look
                            into the transaction referred to.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the conversation which the Embassy had had last December,
                            through Dr. Prebisch’s good offices, with officials of the Banco de la
                            Provincia, I said that the Embassy had received another report
                            indicating that in the first part of January, the Banco de la Provincia
                            had received from the Banco Alemán here two sums aggregating 52,000
                            pesos for the account of the Banco Alemán, Barcelona, through the
                            Instituto Español de Moneda Extranjera of Madrid. This, I said, would
                            seem to be a “cloaking” transaction inconsistent with the understanding
                            which the Embassy had reached with the Banco de la Provincia. Dr.
                            Prebisch said that he would look into this matter also.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the broader question of relations of Argentine banks with
                            black-listed firms, I asked Dr. Prebisch whether there was any policy
                            among the banks here in this regard. I said that the Banco de Avellaneda
                            had given assurances that it would refrain from such transactions and
                            that the American banks, as well as the banks cooperating with the
                            British Embassy, were refraining from operations with firms on the
                            American and British lists. Dr. Prebisch replied that, of course, the
                            Argentine Government had taken no official action in the matter but that
                            transactions with black-listed firms were in general being frowned upon
                            by the Argentine banks. He said that it was realized that the
                            maintenance of relations with black-listed firms would render banks, as
                            well as other commercial organizations, subject to being placed on the
                            black-lists themselves. In this connection, I reminded Dr. Prebisch that
                            the pertinent committee in Washington was becoming more drastic and was
                            frequently calling upon the Embassy for explanations when it received
                            reports that organizations here, including banks, were maintaining
                            relations of <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0470"/>this character.
                            Dr. Prebisch said that he would look into this subject to see whether a
                            more effective policy might be worked out here.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I asked Dr. Prebisch whether in the event that the Argentine
                            Government purchased the French ships here for the newly established
                            Merchant Marine, the proceeds would be blocked, to which Dr. Prebisch
                            replied definitely in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>The general impression that I obtained from this conversation was that
                            Dr. Prebisch favors a cooperative policy with the United States in
                            economic and financial matters, and really wants to be helpful, but
                            either feels powerless in the matter or is unwilling to use his
                            influence to force the issue with the Government.</p>

                            discussing another matter which was relatively unimportant (reported in
                            the Embassy’s despatch No. 4272 of today’s date<note n="39"

                            the recent conference at Rio de Janeiro and the conversations that I had
                            had on February 9 and 20 with Dr. Prebisch (as reported in the Embassy’s
                            despatches No. 4116 of February 10, 1942,<note n="40" xml:id="d438fn40"

                                    <ref target="#pg_455">p. 455</ref>.</note>), including the
                            operations of the Banco de la Nación. (I gathered that Dr. Prebisch may
                            have asked Dr. Grumbach to discuss these matters with the Embassy.)</p>
                        <p>As it was evident that Dr. Grumbach was seeking my comments and had
                            nothing in particular to say himself on the subject, I took occasion to
                            state that earlier in the day the Ambassador had informed me that he was
                            becoming increasingly disturbed regarding reports that the Banco de la
                            Nación was not pursuing policies consistent with those of the United
                            States. I said that I had previously discussed these reports with Dr.
                            Prebisch and that the Embassy earnestly felt that unless some remedy
                            could be found for the situation that appears to exist, the authorities
                            in Washington might deem it necessary to give consideration to the
                            placing of the Banco de la Nación on the Proclaimed List, regrettable as
                            this would be.</p>
                        <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0471"/>
                        <p>Dr. Grumbach said that, of course, every step should be taken to avoid
                            this, that he inquired what our policy was with respect to the relations
                            of banks with black-listed firms and individuals. I said that the same
                            principles applied to banks as applied to the other concerns, viz., that
                            if banks maintained relations with firms on the Proclaimed List, they
                            made themselves subject to being placed on the list also. I said that it
                            was useless to obtain commitments from such institutions as the Banco de
                            Avellaneda that they would sever relations with black-listed firms when
                            the latter could receive facilities at other banks, including the
                            largest and most important bank in the country, namely, the Banco de la
                            Nación. Thus far, I told Dr. Grumbach, the authorities in Washington had
                            apparently been somewhat lenient in regard to banks, probably because of
                            the far-reaching implications involved, but exigencies of the war were
                            requiring that a more drastic policy be pursued. I said that there was
                            no intention to interfere in any way in the internal affairs of
                            Argentina or to “penalize” banks or other concerns having relations with
                            black-listed firms, but that our Government felt perfectly justified in
                            saying to its own nationals that they must refrain from maintaining
                            relations with concerns outside of the United States if the latter
                            concerns were giving aid to the enemy. Dr. Grumbach said that he
                            understood our view of this, but that having just returned from a
                            vacation of some weeks, he had not realized that the application of our
                            policy with respect to banks had become tightened to this extent.</p>
                        <p>Referring to Resolution V of the recent conference at Rio de Janeiro, I
                            said that, speaking off the record, I could say that Argentina’s failure
                            to take any action during the month that had elapsed since the end of
                            the conference had caused a distinctly unfavorable impression in the
                            United States and that it was to be feared that unless some action were
                            taken promptly, this impression would become even worse. After referring
                            to the reports here day before yesterday of a critical article by Mr.
                            Turner Catledge of the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Sun</hi>, I said that I
                            feared that unfavorable comments of that kind would become increasingly
                            conspicuous in the United States if Argentina did not adopt measures
                            pursuant to its commitments at the Rio de Janeiro conference. At this
                            point, I handed Dr. Grumbach a copy of the far-reaching financial and
                            economic decree issued by Ecuador on February 9, 1942, and said that if
                            a country like Ecuador could adopt such measures, it should be far
                            easier for a country with a highly-developed financial structure and
                            machinery, such as Argentina has, to do likewise. (I handed him an
                            additional copy which I said might be of interest to Dr. Prebisch.)</p>
                        <p>Dr. Grumbach then mentioned the political situation here as a factor, to
                            which I replied that I was afraid that that would not serve <pb n="460"
                                xml:id="pg_460" facs="0472"/>to decrease the feeling of impatience
                            in the United States, for it was felt in our country that this war had
                            reached a point where internal politics of countries should be accorded
                            secondary consideration.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Grumbach made no further comments, but as I left he remarked how busy
                            he was being kept by such matters as priorities, and I gathered the
                            impression that perhaps the Central Bank was beginning to perceive a
                            relationship between priorities, allocations and United States purchases
                            of Argentine products, and the position being maintained by Argentina
                            concerning the Axis countries, and that it might be seeking to ascertain
                            the minimum in the way of financial and economic cooperation that the
                            United States would consider satisfactory.</p>

                                printed.</note> reporting authorizations recently granted by the
                            Central Bank for transfers of French francs outside of the
                            Franco-Argentine payments agreement, I have the honor to report that a
                            member of the Embassy staff called this morning upon Dr. Edgardo
                            Grumbach, head of the foreign-exchange department of the Central Bank,
                            and inquired about these transactions.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Grumbach confirmed that the authorizations had been granted, although
                            he emphasized that the pesos paid for the francs would be deposited in a
                            blocked account. He admitted that the resulting blocked funds could be
                            released for such purposes as expenses of the French Embassy (which,
                            like the embassies of the Axis countries, has been limited to 200,000
                            pesos per month), but said that the French Embassy could always obtain
                            its peso requirements for expenses by a deposit of francs, so that the
                            release of blocked funds for this purpose would not in reality represent
                            any important facility. When Dr. Grumbach was reminded of the assurances
                            given by Dr. Prebisch to the effect that the negotiations for the
                            renewal of the French payments agreement had been suspended by the
                            Central Bank and that there was no intention of renewing them (Embassy’s
                            despatch no. 4116 of February 10, 1942,<note n="43" xml:id="d439fn43"
                                >Not printed, but see memorandum of February 9, and footnote 31,

                            despatches), and when he was told that the recent authorizations did not
                            seem to be consistent with those assurances, Dr. Grumbach said that,
                            speaking in great confidence and “off the record”, the recent action was
                            taken, against <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0473"/>the wishes of
                            the Central Bank, as a result of instructions from the Ministry of
                            Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Grumbach was told that although our Government had no desire to
                            interfere in any way with Argentine relations with a friendly third
                            country, as had been made clear in the previous conversations, it had
                            hoped that the Argentine authorities would be able to cooperate in this
                            matter with our Government’s policy of endeavoring to minimize the
                            foreign exchange made available in the Hemisphere for Axis uses; that
                            while these funds might be blocked they could nevertheless be unblocked
                            for purposes that would represent facilities to the Axis countries; that
                            the very fact that so much interest had been shown to have the
                            authorizations made was in itself evidence that the authorizations
                            represented facilities; and that, indeed, it was feared that the news of
                            the authorizations would be viewed with disappointment in Washington,
                            where the friendly cooperation in regard to the payments agreement had
                            previously been a source of gratification.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Mr. Simon thinks that it would be advisable for both of our Embassies to
                            discuss the subject at the Foreign Office and states that the British
                            Ambassador would be disposed to do so if I should take similar action. I
                            am hesitant to do this, in the absence of instructions from the
                            Department, inasmuch as our Government, unlike the British Government,
                            is continuing to maintain diplomatic relations with the Vichy
                            Government. The Embassy has interpreted the Department’s telegram no.

                            blocked funds of the German Reichsbank have been released in the amount
                            of two hundred and fifty thousand pesos at the request <pb n="462"
                                xml:id="pg_462" facs="0474"/>of the Siemens Company for the payment
                            of loans contracted with certain Argentine banks by the “Inag” Fábricas

                            Germany. It is not known whether one of the local German banks was among
                            the institutions receiving this payment, but irrespective of this
                            consideration the operation served to increase the credit of a German

                        <p>At the time of the collapse of France in June, 1940, there was, it is
                            understood, an accumulation of three or four hundred million French
                            francs in the fund of the Argentine-French payments agreement. Shortly
                            thereafter it was made known that when this fund became exhausted the
                            Argentine authorities would not authorize further transfers of payments
                            to occupied or unoccupied France during the remainder of the war. It has
                            recently come to the attention of the Embassy of the United States of
                            America that authorizations have been granted for two sizable financial
                            remittances to occupied France by the Cervecería Argentina Quilmes and
                            the Banco Hipotecario Franco-Argentino, these funds being transferred
                            entirely outside of the Argentine-French payments agreement.</p>

                            that the United States Government considers the transfers in question to
                            constitute a serious violation of Resolution V of the Rio de Janeiro

                        <p>On April 7 and again on April 9, officers of the Embassy had
                            conversations with Sr. Alberto Tintoré, head of the foreign department
                            of the Banco de la Provincia, in the course of which reference was made
                            to the conversation last December at the Central Bank with the general
                            manager and head of the foreign-exchange department of the Banco de la
                            Provincia during the visit in Buenos Aires of Mr. Ravndal<note n="48"
                                xml:id="d442fn48">On November 19, 1941, Christian M. Ravndal was
                                sent by the Department to the American Missions in South America to
                                discuss export controls, the freezing of foreign funds, and the
                                Proclaimed List.</note> and to the letter received from the bank
                            several days thereafter (reported in the Embassy’s despatch No. 3825 of
                            January 8, 1942<note n="47" xml:id="d442fn53">Not printed.</note>). In
                            the conversation on April 7, Sr. Tintoré said that he could say
                            definitely that his institution had no relations with firms and
                            individuals on the Proclaimed List outside of Argentina, but that as he
                            was not familiar with the bank’s policy as applied to relations with
                            such firms and individuals located within the country, he would be
                            obliged to consult with other officers of the bank before giving an
                            answer. On April 9, Sr. Tintoré said that after consulting with Dr.
                            d’Oliveira, general manager of the bank, he could say that the policy of
                            his institution was not to grant new credits to parties on the
                            Proclaimed List and to liquidate by degrees such credits as were
                            outstanding. He stated that this was consistent with sound banking
                            practice inasmuch as listed firms, if they should have need for loans,
                            would probably not be good credit risks. When questioned on the point,
                            Sr. Tintoré said that even if a firm on the Proclaimed List were a good
                            risk, and wished credit, it would be the policy of his bank not <pb
                                n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0476"/>to grant it, although he
                            admitted that there might be rare exceptions. In regard to transactions
                            with Europe, he said that the Banco de la Provincia pursued a strict
                            policy of scrutinizing the facts of every case before transferring a
                            payment, and he referred in this connection to what he characterized as
                            the strictly enforced control of the Central Bank through requiring a
                            specific authorization before a payment to Europe could be made. Sr.
                            Tintoré gave evidence of wishing to cooperate fully with the Embassy,
                            including furnishing complete information on any individual cases. (In
                            this regard, see the Embassy’s despatch No. 4715 of yesterday’s [<hi

                            de la Provincia by Mr. Frederick J. Gilfillan.) When Sr. Tintoré was
                            told that the Embassy’s gratification in receiving his bank’s renewed
                            assurances of cooperation would be increased in Washington if they could
                            be confirmed in some form of written communication, he said that he
                            would be glad to inquire of his superiors whether this could be
                            done.</p>

                        <p>The Embassy had a conversation on April 7 with Sr. Carlos Alfredo
                            Tornquist, formerly head of the bank and now a member of the Board of
                            Directors, who was accompanied by another director and the head of the
                            foreign-exchange department of the institution. These persons stated
                            emphatically that it was the policy of the bank to desist from all
                            transactions with firms on the Proclaimed List either in Argentina or
                            abroad and said that the bank could be counted upon to cooperate in
                            every way possible with pertinent war measures of the United States. Sr.
                            Tornquist offered to confirm this in a letter to the Embassy. Although a
                            report has been received from a discharged employee of the bank
                            indicating that Sr. Tornquist has subsequently gone to Rio de Janeiro to
                            negotiate an operation involving interests that are ostensibly Belgian
                            but in reality German (a report which the Embassy is now investigating),
                            all other evidence indicates that this institution is pro-democratic and
                            friendly towards the United States.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Enrique Gruber, President of the above-mentioned bank, informed the
                            Embassy on April 7 that his institution was cooperating completely with
                            our Government and that it had no relations whatsoever with firms or
                            individuals on the Proclaimed List. He said that his bank did a
                            considerable proportion of the Polish business in Argentina and that it
                            could be relied upon to be completely anti-Nazi. When questioned in the
                            matter, Dr. Gruber said that it was true that the bank was not on
                            friendly terms with the Polish Legation but that this was due to its
                            refusal about a year and a half ago to turn the bank <pb n="465"
                                xml:id="pg_465" facs="0477"/>over to a representative of the Polish
                            Ministry of Finance who suddenly appeared in Buenos Aires seeking to
                            take over the institution by payment of 900,000 pesos and whose mission
                            the Polish Legation supported. The ownership of the bank, he said, had
                            been placed in escrow during the remainder of the war with the result
                            that the bank could not legally have been sold under these
                            circumstances. Dr. Gruber, who stated that before coming to Buenos Aires
                            to establish the Polish Bank here some ten years ago he had been head of
                            two large banks in Warsaw, claimed that his institution was owned by
                            Polish interests but was not controlled directly or indirectly by the
                            Polish Government.</p>

                        <p>Sr. Le Prevost, head of the foreign-exchange department of the above
                            bank, called at the Embassy on April 9. He gave assurances that his
                            institution was cooperating in every way with the war financial policy
                            of our Government and that it was granting no credit facilities to firms
                            on the Proclaimed List.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Julius Strupp, a partner of the above company (and a naturalized
                            American citizen) called at the Embassy yesterday and gave assurances,
                            as he had done before, that his bank was cooperating fully with our
                            Government. When told that a report had been received that the books of
                            his company for 1941 had not been audited (see Embassy’s despatch No.
                            4217 of February 24, 1942<note n="52" xml:id="d442fn52">Not
                                printed.</note>), Mr. Strupp stated that the British auditors,
                            Deloitte, Plender, Griffiths and Company, were working on the books now
                            and would certify them shortly. He then volunteered the information that
                            Price, Waterhouse had declined to certify the bank’s books for the
                            reason that the auditor assigned to the work did not understand banking
                            practices, more especially purchase-and-sale entries relating to the
                            borrowing of bonds for three months at a commission for purposes of
                            tenders by the bank’s clients. Although this explanation might well be
                            questioned, it would seem that if Deloitte, Plender, Griffiths and
                            Company are disposed to certify the books, any previous irregularities
                            have now been corrected.</p>
                        <p>Some time ago Shaw, Strupp and Company gave assurances in writing to the
                            British Embassy concerning cooperation with war measures, and insofar as
                            is known there has been no evidence that those assurances have been
                            violated.</p>

                        <p>Two officers of the Embassy called upon Sr. Quesada, the general manager
                            of this bank, on April 8. Sr. Quesada explained that his <pb n="466"
                                xml:id="pg_466" facs="0478"/>bank had no relations with firms and
                            individuals on the Proclaimed List established outside of Argentina, but
                            he indicated that his bank saw no reason why it should desist from such
                            relations within the country.</p>
                        <p>There is some doubt as to the pro-democratic sympathies of this bank. At
                            least one of its directors is understood to be avowedly pro-Nazi, and
                            Dr. Carlos A. Pueyrredón, the Mayor of Buenos Aires, who is a
                            conservative and whose belief in the principles of continental
                            solidarity may be questioned, is said to have considerable interests in
                            the bank.</p>
                        <postscript>
                            <p>All of the banks with whom these conversations were held stated that
                                they continued to have an interest in the financial facilities
                                contemplated, although in general they questioned whether they would
                                be able to avail themselves of such facilities under existing trade
                                conditions.</p>
                            <p>As the Banco Société Génerale, the Banco de Italia y Río de la Plata,
                                and the Banco Holandés Unido have given secret undertakings to the
                                British Embassy and have, it is reported, been cooperating closely
                                with that mission, no conversations were deemed necessary at this
                                time.</p>
                            <p>In the Embassy’s telegram No. 645 of April 10, 3 p.m., there were
                                recommended as suitable agencies for purposes of the credit plan of
                                the Export-Import Bank of Washington all of the banks mentioned in
                                the Department’s telegram No. 337 of March 11, 12 noon, except
                                Argentaría, which can probably best be investigated in the United
                                States in relation to J. Henry Schroeder Banking Corporation, which
                                controls it; The Banco Popular Argentino, which, it is felt, has
                                thus far failed to demonstrate a sufficiently cooperative attitude,
                                as indicated above; and the Banco Español del Río de la Plata.
                                Although the last-named institution is reported to be owned
                                principally within Argentina (at one time it was owned by interests
                                in Spain), it is closely allied with Spanish interests, has
                                subsidiaries in Spain, and is actively engaged in financing
                                Argentine exports to that country, a portion of which, according to
                                recent reports reaching the Embassy, are likely to be proceeding
                                ultimately to Germany or occupied territories. There is reason to
                                believe, therefore, that the institution may be regarded by the Axis
                                countries as a “friendly bank.” If further investigations should
                                indicate this to be not the case, the Department will be promptly
                                informed in the premises.</p>

                            months the Embassy has frequently urged in informal conversations with
                            Central Bank officials the removal of these restrictions. The bank
                            yesterday definitely assured the Embassy that on or about May 1 not only
                            will all imports from the United States for which no exchange is now
                            made available be admitted into Argentina, but that the bulk of the
                            exchange rates will be adjusted to extend to United States products no
                            less favorable treatment than that accorded to third countries
                            notwithstanding the exceptions provided for in the related notes to the
                            trade agreement.</p>

                            the Central Bank and in payment of debts contracted with certain

                            Sanitarios.</p>
                        <p>In reply, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship takes pleasure in
                            indicating to the Embassy of the United States of America that on this
                            occasion the Argentine Government wishes to submit the following
                            explanations:</p>
                        <p>The remittances made to France for purposes of financial services could
                            not be effected by using the francs which the Central Bank has <pb
                                n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0480"/>in the Bank of France in the
                            payments account between Argentina and France for the reason that the
                            amounts available are small and it has been considered advisable to hold
                            these exclusively for taking care of other payments of small amounts.
                            Consequently, for making remittances of financial services to France
                            without employing the aforementioned francs there were three different
                            possibilities: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>to give free exchange (Swiss francs, escudos), which in
                                    affecting our exchange reserves involved the possibility that
                                    those reserves would not be utilized in the final analysis for
                                    the purposes for which they were intended;</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>to give francs, which could have been done by making use of
                                    the credit in the Bank of France, in accordance with the terms
                                    of the existing agreement. It was not judged advisable to
                                    contract debts of this character for providing financial
                                    services; and</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                                <item>to authorize the transfer in accordance with the procedure
                                    with which we can now make transfers to Germany, Italy and
                                    countries with compensation accounts.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>This last form of procedure is very simple and does not involve any
                            movement of exchange. It is the one which was chosen for authorizing the
                            services of the Cervecería Argentina Quilmes and the Banco Hipotecario
                            Franco-Argentino. It consists of the following: the Argentine bank which
                            desires to make the transfer seeks a French bank which is willing to
                            sell it francs for this purpose and to receive their equivalent in local
                            currency. <hi rend="italic">This equivalent in local currency in favor
                                of the French bank is blocked and may not be used in any case for
                                purchasing free exchange</hi>. Only the Central Bank may grant
                            authorization for employing the funds for purely internal expenditures,
                            in accordance with the following purposes; <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>

                        <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0481"/>
                        <p>With respect to the other operation mentioned by the Embassy it deals
                            with the following: the Central Bank authorized that funds blocked in
                            the account of the “Deutsche Ueberseeische”, of Berlin be transferred to
                            the firm “Inag” for increasing its capital and amortizing at the same
                            time a debt in the Banco Alemán. This operation is doubly advantageous
                            for Argentina: first, because “Inag” is developing industrial
                            enterprises of great utility for the country: it manufactures X-ray
                            apparatus and dental and surgical instruments; and secondly, because it
                            conforms with the policy being pursued by the Central Bank in
                            endeavoring to have firms of foreign origin which have obligations with
                            the local banks in amounts which are very large in proportion to their
                            capital in the country amortize these debts by degrees.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, in the operation itself there is nothing which can benefit
                            foreign countries. On the other hand, the adoption of measures of
                            control, however strict these may be, is not aimed at prejudicing
                            legitimate interests, but on the contrary, should guarantee the
                            development of activities useful for the country and place them under
                            protection from acts or interventions capable of adversely affecting the
                            national interests.</p>
                        <p>There being thus explained the operations mentioned, the Argentine
                            Government rejects the statement of that Embassy which indicates that
                            the aforementioned transfers constitute a serious violation of
                            Resolution V, of the Rio de Janeiro Conference. It should be recalled
                            that in that conference the Argentine Delegation made clear that it was
                            in accord with the need of taking measures of economic and financial
                            control of all internal or external activities of firms or enterprises
                            which might adversely affect, in one way or another, the welfare of the
                            Republics of this continent or the continental solidarity or defense,
                            and therefore it does not consider justified the opinion that there
                            should be included in the obligation contracted at Rio de Janeiro
                            financial operations conducted in the form and for the purposes outlined
                            above.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, the Argentine Government must necessarily assume that only
                            an incomplete knowledge of the facts has permitted the Government of the
                            United States to furnish that Embassy with necessary instructions for
                            the sending of the memoranda which are herewith replied to.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship avails itself of this
                            opportunity to present its compliments to the Embassy of the United
                            States of America.</p>

                        <p>The Government of the United States has carefully considered the
                            memorandum of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship dated May 8,
                            1942, which refers to two <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoires</hi>, of the
                            Embassy of the United States, both dated April 9, 1942, concerning
                            financial remittances from the Cervecería Argentina Quilmes and the
                            Banco Hipotecario Franco-Argentino, to occupied France, and concerning
                            the release of blocked German funds for the benefit of the “Inag”
                            Fábricas Reunidas de Utiles Sanitarios.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the remittances of the Cervecería Argentina Quilmes and
                            the Banco Hipotecario Franco-Argentino, the aforementioned memorandum
                            appears to assume that it was necessary to make these payments in some
                            form, and after enumerating various possible methods of transfers, it
                            states that the most advantageous form was found to be that which was
                            followed, viz., to arrange for credits in France to be compensated for
                            by an equivalence in Argentine pesos deposited in blocked accounts in
                            this country. The memorandum adds that these blocked pesos may be
                            released only for certain enumerated purposes.</p>
                        <p>It would appear that, as viewed from any angle, these operations
                            represent facilities to occupied France which could benefit the German
                            authorities, for not only do the payee companies in France receive funds
                            and does the French Bank receive assets in Argentina against which notes
                            may be issued, but also the pesos in Argentina, while initially blocked,
                            may be released for various purposes. The Government of the United
                            States, therefore, continues to consider that these transactions are
                            inconsistent with Resolution V of the Rio de Janeiro Conference, in
                            which all of the American Republics, including Argentina, agreed to

                            this transaction was inconsistent with Resolution V of the Rio de
                            Janeiro Conference for at least three reasons: (1) it permitted a
                            payment from a blocked fund to a German bank whose interests are
                            admittedly closely identified with those of the aggressor nations and
                            whose liquid resources are by the transaction increased; (2) it
                            permitted the German firm’s subsidiary to increase its credit in
                            Argentina by decreasing its banking indebtedness; and (3) by providing
                            for an increase of capital of a German firm, it increased in a
                            corresponding amount the resources in an American country of a company
                            under the control of the German authorities. The Department of State
                            feels that there can be no doubt that all three of these aspects of the
                            operation in question are inconsistent with what the twenty-one American
                            Republics had in mind when they agreed upon Resolution V of the Rio de
                            Janeiro Conference.</p>
                        <p>As to the considerations in the memorandum with respect to the Argentine
                            national interests involved in the development of industrial enterprises
                            in the country, the Government of the United States has consistently
                            given support to those various inter-American activities serving to
                            facilitate and encourage the development of industry within the
                            republics of the continent. It is believed, however, that Resolution V
                            of the Rio de Janeiro Conference did not contemplate that the interests
                            of national industries would be placed ahead of the interests of
                            continental defense in fulfilling the obligations contracted in that
                            Resolution.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing considerations, the Government of the United
                            States is confident that the Argentine Government will agree that
                            financial operations of these kinds are not in harmony with the
                            inter-American resolution aforementioned.</p>

                            not concerned primarily with methods of improving Argentine

                            of foreign relations is obviously of proper concern only to the
                            Department of State under the instruction of the President.</p>

                        <p>982. Embassy’s despatch number 4710 of April 11 regarding Export-Import
                            Bank credits. Central Bank states that the Banco de la Provincia de
                            Buenos Aires is not included in list of allocations just received from
                            the Import-Export Bank and expresses the opinion that it would have
                            unfortunate effects if this bank which is the second largest here and
                            semi-governmental should be left out. The Embassy concurs and in view of
                            apparent cooperative attitude of the Banco de la Provincia as reported
                            in aforementioned despatch and number 4924 of May 1<note n="64"

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">General</hi></p>
                        <p>Another month has elapsed since the Río de Janeiro Conference without the
                            Argentine Government evidencing any appreciable disposition to adopt
                            measures in accordance with Resolution V of that conference. Virtually
                            the only development of this nature during May was a circular (No. 283)
                            of the Central Bank, dated May 7, 1942, providing restrictions on
                            remittances abroad by drafts, travellers’ checks, etc., presumably in
                            order to provide the Bank with a better check on the destination of
                            funds sent abroad (the Embassy’s despatch No. 5085 of May 14, 1942<note
                                n="65" xml:id="d448fn67">Not printed.</note>), but it remains to be
                            seen whether this measure will be used effectively against the Axis
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Some encouragement may be found in the fact that Dr. Irigoyen, the Under
                            Secretary of Finance, took occasion to mention to me briefly at the
                            opening of Congress on May 28 that the outlook for greater foreign-funds
                            control here was now more promising. Similarly, Dr. Irigoyen in a
                            conversation with an officer of the Embassy on May 19 intimated that
                            there might be developments here with respect to Resolution V of the Rio
                            de Janeiro Conference in about two weeks thence (the time of the opening
                            of Congress had not yet been announced), and it seems not unlikely that
                            he had in mind legislation to be introduced in Congress shortly after
                            its opening, especially as he had indicated in a conversation with
                            Messrs. Meltzer and Towson<note n="66" xml:id="d448fn66">Bernard D.
                                Meltzer, Assistant to Assistant Secretary of State Acheson, and
                                Norman E. Towson, Assistant Director of Foreign Funds Control,
                                Department of the Treasury, on special mission to certain of the
                                American Republics.</note> during their visit here some weeks ago
                            that the Government felt that it did not have authority to go further in
                            the control of financial transactions with or for the benefit of the
                            Axis countries without Congressional legislation. While Dr. Irigoyen’s
                            recent remarks have offered some encouragement, there is, of course, the
                            possibility that the position that the Government must await
                            authorization from Congress before taking additional steps or enforcing
                            more strictly existing measures has been adopted as a convenient means
                            of avoiding responsibility and with a belief that the
                            Conservative-controlled Senate might obstruct the enactment of such
                            legislation.</p>
                        <p>The attitude of the Argentine Government in the whole matter of
                            Axis-funds control was evidenced in its memorandum of May 8, 1942, sent
                            to the Embassy in reply to representations concerning transfers of funds
                            to occupied France and the release of blocked funds here for <pb n="476"
                                xml:id="pg_476" facs="0488"/>the benefit of a German bank and an
                            Argentine subsidiary of the Siemens Company (the Embassy’s despatch No.
                            5031 of May 11, 1942<note n="69" xml:id="d448fn69">Not printed.</note>).
                            The Argentine memorandum appeared to justify the operation of releasing
                            blocked German funds on the grounds of benefits that Argentina would
                            derive, and while stating that “therefore, in the operation itself there
                            is nothing which can benefit foreign countries,” the memorandum did not
                            even attempt to give reasons why Axis interests would not profit by the
                            transaction to the detriment of continental defense.</p>

                        <p>With respect to looted United States securities, the Embassy has been
                            endeavoring through a competent investigator to find a “black market”
                            for these here, but it appears that any such market is not large, and
                            there is no available evidence that considerable amounts of such
                            securities are being offered for sale in Buenos Aires. In fact, the only
                            securities selling at large discounts that it has been possible to
                            locate have been two relatively small blocks of Imperial Oil (quoted on
                            the New York Curb Exchange) and International Petroleum (quoted on the
                            New York Stock Exchange). In this connection, it is reported here that a
                            large proportion of the United States securities purchased in Europe in
                            recent years have been held for safekeeping in the United States.
                            Argentine securities imported into this country from Europe must, as has
                            been previously reported, be declared and placed under the control of
                            the Central Bank.</p>

                                printed.</note> While the difficulties of tracing the history of
                            bank notes and preventing smuggling into Argentina are recognized, these
                            difficulties are no greater in the case of Argentina than in the case of
                            other countries. It would seem necessary that a few unfortunates may
                            have to suffer by reason of these difficulties in order that the
                            essential purpose of the Treasury restrictions may be realized; namely
                            to prevent the Axis powers from liquidating <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477"
                                facs="0489"/>looted currency through the facilities of other
                            countries, particularly the American Republics. The same considerations
                            are present with respect to the effect of Central Bank control upon the
                            exchange market. Furthermore, it is believed that the establishment and
                            proper administration of appropriate controls by the Central Bank would
                            considerably minimize the possibility of injury to legitimate
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>With respect to travelers bringing dollar notes into Argentina, the
                            Department approves of the position taken by the Embassy’s officer in
                            his conversation with Grumbach. Such currency brought into Argentina by
                            European travelers is currency against which the Treasury measure is
                            aimed and there would seem to be no reason why persons leaving Europe
                            could not travel with other forms of money such as dollar drafts, et
                            cetera, which it is not believed would interfere too greatly with the
                            “customary” practice. United States Customs authorities are allowing for
                            the time being a $250 exemption for each person entering the United
                            States, plus a like amount for each accompanying dependent. Such an
                            exemption is necessary in this country since dollar currency is the
                            legal exchange medium and a refusal to permit reasonable amounts to be
                            brought in free of restriction might cause hardship. There would seem to
                            be no reason for a similar exemption in the case of dollar currency
                            brought into Argentina, since other recognized mediums of exchange are
                            readily available.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the holdings of banks and exchange shops under the
                            control of the Central Bank, it is not believed that any general
                            exemption can be granted but the <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi> of
                            the holdings and the fact that they were acquired prior to the close of
                            business on May 19, together with the adequacy of the controls adopted
                            by Argentina, will be taken into consideration by the Treasury in any
                            application for their release. The same considerations are applicable to
                            dollar notes bought in good faith for non-banking and non-speculative
                            purposes before the news of the Treasury restriction became generally
                            known in Argentina.</p>

                        <p>As you know, it is of paramount importance to eliminate pro-Axis
                            financial and commercial transactions which are being executed in
                            Argentina. To accomplish this, not only is it necessary for the staff of
                            the Embassy effectively to implement the various control measures which
                            have been adopted by our Government, but it is also necessary to induce,
                            if possible, the Argentine Government to adopt complementary controls in
                            accordance with the provisions of Resolution V adopted at the Rio
                            Conference. This Department, and the other interested government
                            agencies, view with grave concern the pro-Axis transactions which are
                            being carried on in Argentina and the uncooperative attitude of the
                            Argentine Government. It is, therefore, suggested that you personally
                            follow questions raised by action designed to strengthen United States
                            control measures or to induce the Argentine Government to carry out the
                            commitments embodied in Resolution V.</p>

                            measures which would strengthen United States controls have, of course,
                            been suggested from time to time. In accordance with those suggestions,
                            and with steps already taken by the Embassy, further vigorous action
                            along the following lines, among others, is an indispensable
                            prerequisite to increasing the effectiveness of our controls: <list>

                                    through the Central Bank or otherwise, regarding remittances to
                                    each neutral country for the last four years. These figures
                                    might be analyzed in the light of the trade balances between
                                    Argentina and the countries involved, and an estimate might be
                                    made of the amount of remittances not referable to “legitimate
                                    trade transactions” which have been made to Axis territory
                                    directly, or indirectly through neutral European countries. In
                                    this connection, it is, of course, significant that officials of
                                    the Central Bank and the Argentine Government have repeatedly
                                    stated that remittances to neutrals are limited to those
                                    connected with “legitimate trade transactions”. An explanation

                            been unsatisfactory in character. In addition, you should make strong
                            representations to the Argentine Government regarding its failure to
                            implement Resolution V by severing commercial and financial intercourse
                            direct or indirect between Argentina and the nations signatory to the
                            Tripartite Pact and its failure to take measures to eliminate financial
                            and commercial activities which are prejudicial to the welfare and
                            security of the American republics. It is requested that, in the first
                            instance, this matter should be taken up with the President of Argentina
                            to insure his receiving a proper report of the attitude of this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department is also preparing an instruction suggesting
                            representations to be made to the Argentine Government concerning
                            pro-Axis activities in Argentina, in fields other than commercial and
                            financial. It is suggested that you do not seek an interview with the
                            President until you have received that instruction and are prepared to
                            make representations concerning both the matters covered herein and in

                        <p>Your representations regarding Resolution V should, unless you perceive
                            some objection, include reference to the following:</p>
                        <p>(1) As a result of Argentina’s failure to implement Resolution V and the
                            consequent inadequacy of Argentine controls, the nations signatory to
                            the Tripartite Pact, the territories dominated by such nations, and the
                            nationals and partisans of both, are executing financial and commercial
                            transactions in Argentina, or through the use of Argentine facilities,
                            which prejudice the welfare and security of the American republics.</p>

                                    States Government that such funds may, under existing Argentine
                                    controls, be freely unblocked and used for purposes which
                                    prejudice the welfare and security of the United States and the
                                    other American republics.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>(2) As a further result of Argentina’s inadequate controls, shipments of
                            material from the United States to Argentina, and the extension of
                            public or private credit by the United States to Argentina may directly
                            or indirectly increase the economic and financial power of Axis agents
                            and other Axis partisans in Argentina who are executing commercial and
                            financial transactions which are inimical to the security and welfare of
                            the American republics. In determining allocations of increasingly
                            scarce material and shipping space and in its total commercial and
                            economic relations with Argentina, the United States Government will be
                            compelled to give appropriate weight to this fact—that shipments from
                            the United States and other transactions between the United States and
                            Argentina may, in the absence of appropriate controls by Argentina,
                            directly or indirectly increase the economic and financial power of the
                            enemies of the United States and of the other American republics.</p>
                        <p>(3) The United States Government would be constrained to view the future
                            continued failure of Argentina to carry out the commitments embodied in
                            Resolution V adopted at Rio de Janeiro as a definitive indication of
                            Argentina’s intention neither to fulfill the obligations, nor to gain
                            the benefits, of the several inter-American instruments with respect to
                            commercial and economic matters, to which she is a party.</p>

                                    indicates that transfers are still being made directly to Axis
                                    territory. The Department has been under the impression that
                                    such transfers had been stopped through the denial of the
                                    required licenses. If such is not the case, you should object to

                                n="78" xml:id="d452fn78">H. Merle Cochran, of the Department, on
                                special mission to Argentina June 8–July 23, 1942.</note> and
                            Meltzer to carry this personal letter to you so as to explain certain
                            aspects of the situation here in Washington with respect to
                            Argentina.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the Treasury Department in a meeting of the Board of
                            Economic Warfare recommended that the freezing controls of this country
                            be applied generally to Argentina. As you also know, this proposal was
                            definitely rejected and there is no intention to have that decision
                            modified. In this connection Mr. Welles feels that it will be desirable
                            to make clear to you one point covered in the instructions<note n="79"
                                xml:id="d452fn79">Instruction No. 2480, June 4, <ref
                                    target="#pg_478">p. 478</ref>.</note> which Messrs. Cochran and
                            Meltzer are presenting to you personally. In paragraph (2) on page
                                2<note n="80" xml:id="d452fn80">Paragraph (2) under section numbered
                                I.</note> it is stated that firms in the United States or in
                            Argentina who are found to be engaged in cloaking activities should be
                            reported to the Department with a view toward having the United States
                            Treasury apply <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> freezing controls to their
                            activities. This does not mean that there would be any general freezing
                            of Argentina but merely refers to the practice which is now being
                            followed regarding the activities of all persons wherever resident who
                            are found to be acting for or on behalf of enemy countries. Persons who
                            are frozen by this manner may engage in transactions in so far as they
                            are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States only pursuant to
                            license.</p>
                        <p>When Treasury’s proposal was made it was fortunate that Mr. Meltzer was
                            available to the Department in as much as his information and knowledge,
                            resulting to a great extent from his recent trip to Buenos Aires and his
                            work with the Embassy, made it possible to present without delay a
                            reasoned analysis of the Treasury proposal.</p>
                        <p>Having failed in its efforts to freeze Argentine funds, the Treasury
                            Department then complained about the inadequacy of the information <pb
                                n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0495"/>on Argentine financial and
                            commercial matters and strongly urged that at least three Treasury
                            officers be sent to Argentina to study this subject and report directly
                            to Treasury. In dealing with this suggestion it was fortunate that Mr.
                            Meltzer had recently visited the Embassy and could report favorably on
                            the work which it was carrying out.</p>
                        <p>The Treasury proposal was met by a counter-proposal of the Department to
                            assign Messrs. Cochran and Meltzer temporarily to Buenos Aires for the
                            purpose of assisting the Embassy in preparing the report requested in
                            the Department’s instructions and to work on other matters as explained
                            in my telegram of June 6, 1942.<note n="81" xml:id="d452fn81">Telegram

                        <p>I am sure that Messrs. Cochran and Meltzer will do everything in their
                            power to be of maximum assistance to you and the Embassy.</p>

                        <p>827. Reference your 982, May 26 regarding Banco de la Provincia. The
                            Department feels that the desire of the bank to be included in the
                            Export-Import Bank’s approved list should be used to obtain from the
                            bank a written statement approved by the board of directors that: (1)
                            The bank will grant no new credits or overdrafts to Proclaimed List
                            persons, (2) the bank will proceed immediately and definitely to
                            eliminate existing credits and overdrafts of this nature (in this
                            connection the bank should give its oral agreement to furnish to the
                            Embassy full information concerning the existence of all such credits
                            and overdrafts), (3) the bank will inform the Embassy before making any
                            remittance to any Axis occupied or controlled country or to any European
                            neutral country if any person in any Axis occupied or controlled country
                            has an interest, giving the Embassy the full details of the contemplated
                            transaction, (4) the bank will cooperate with the Embassy in cases of
                            intended transfers to foreign countries where there might be any doubt
                            as to possible benefit to enemies of the allied nations.</p>
                        <p>The Department appreciates the cooperative attitude displayed by

                        <p>Please forward your opinion concerning the desirability of obtaining an
                            agreement along these lines as a condition of the inclusion of the Banco
                            de la Provincia in the Export-Import Bank’s approved list. It should be
                            understood that in the event the Banco de la Provincia does not strictly
                            comply with the above assurances the facilities of the Export-Import
                            Bank will be withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>Your opinion is also requested as to the advisability of obtaining
                            similar assurances from all banks to be included in the Export-Import
                            Bank’s approved list. It is thought that formal rather than informal
                            assurances might strengthen the Embassy’s position with regard to banks
                            which in the past may have been engaged in questionable activities.</p>

                                printed.</note> The Ministry of Finance has issued a press release
                            together with three decrees reported in the evening papers implementing
                            Resolution V.</p>
                        <p>The press release, bearing the caption “measures of economic and
                            financial control resulting from the fifth recommendation of the
                            consulative meeting at Rio de Janeiro,” notes that the “fifth
                            recommendation refers to the cutting off during the present continental
                            emergency of all commercial and financial intercourse between the
                            Western Hemisphere and the nations signatory to the Tripartite Pact and
                            the territories dominated by them as well as suspending commercial and
                            financial activities prejudicial to the welfare of the American
                            Republics.” Later it states that “Doctor Acevedo<note n="86"
                                xml:id="d454fn86">Carlos Alberto Acevedo, Argentine Minister of
                                Finance.</note> declared that the decrees signed today have been
                            issued in accordance with the fifth recommendation at Rio within the
                            spirit of the Argentine reservation which of course does not affect the
                            scope and efficacy of the control but which strengthens it.” After
                            outlining the contents of the decrees, the press release reports that
                            according to Doctor Acevedo his Ministry is preparing a draft law which
                            will be soon submitted to Congress to enable the adoption of still
                            further measures and in a final paragraph states that the Minister
                            concluded “by saying that in that way the executive power has evidenced
                            its firm purpose of fulfilling within its powers the obligations
                            contracted at Rio concerning everything <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485"
                                facs="0497"/>that pertains to the welfare of the nation or of the

                        <p>The decrees which are dated today in general give the Ministry of Finance
                            and the Central Bank far-reaching discretionary powers of control
                            although freezing of funds is not specifically provided for. Decree
                            number 122712 signed by the Acting President and seven Ministers
                            authorizes the naming of supervisors or interventors in any enterprise
                            “which belongs to non-American belligerent foreigners or whose
                            activities are in any way connected with non-American foreign
                            belligerent countries or citizens[”]; provides for the recommendation by
                            a commission of penalties and other measures when there are found to be
                            cases deemed inimical to the national or continental interests; and
                            increases the control over the external and internal movement of funds
                            granted the Central Bank in the decree of January 8.</p>
                        <p>Decree number 122713 signed by the Acting President and the Minister of
                            Finance authorizes the Central Bank to require sworn statements of any
                            persons or firms engaging in any way in transactions abroad as to
                            details of their operations and provides for penalties for false
                            declarations.</p>
                        <p>Decree number 122714 with the same signatures extends to operations with
                            all non-American countries the control provided by decree number 66230
                            of June 26, 1940; provides that from 30 days from the date of the decree

                            accounts in the names of parties in non-American countries must furnish
                            the Central Bank with a sworn declaration containing pertinent
                            information; gives the Central Bank broad powers to require the transfer
                            of such assets to authorized banks or on institutions and provides for
                            penalties.</p>

                        <p>Tonight Grumbach invited an officer of the Embassy to call at his home
                            and explained these various measures. He indicated that the Central Bank
                            had drawn them up and that while it had hoped that it might be able to
                            obtain 80% of them from the Government it secured all that it asked for.
                            While the measures do not differentiate between the non-American
                            belligerent countries, he volunteered the comment that this was owing to
                            political consideration but that it was the intention to apply them only
                            against the Axis countries. When asked for an indication as to the
                            policy in other respects that would be applied in utilizing these powers
                            he said that he thought that Prebisch might be disposed to furnish the
                            Embassy with confidential information on the point tomorrow. However, he
                            emphasized the difficulties that had confronted the Central Bank in the
                            administration <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0498"/>of foreign funds
                            control in the past because of what was felt to be insufficient powers
                            and expressed the belief that now it had broad powers with which it
                            could go ahead.</p>
                        <p>I believe that it would be highly desirable if the fullest publicity
                            possible could be given to these measures and if there could be thus
                            encouraged the efforts that are being made here to offer greater
                            collaboration.</p>

                        <p>1196. Embassy’s 1146, June 15, midnight. Cochran, Gantenbein, and Meltzer
                            had long and frank conference yesterday with Prebisch and with the
                            Central Bank’s representatives to Conference, Gagneux and Grumbach,
                            regarding adequacy of decrees. Bank officials appeared anxious to learn
                            of criticism of decrees which might be made in Washington and of methods
                            for improving them. Following is a summary analysis of decrees and of
                            conversations: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Decrees do not increase authority to block assets of Axis
                                    nationals and partisans in Argentina. However, bank officials
                                    stated that an earlier decree number 110,790 (see despatch 3865,
                                    June [<hi rend="italic">January</hi>] 13<note n="88"
                                        xml:id="d455fn88">Not printed.</note>) blocking of funds of
                                    Axis nationals as such and of any other person or firm,
                                    irrespective of nationality, in Argentina, which carries on
                                    pro-Axis activities. The basis for such blocking which was
                                    admitted to be tenuous as a matter of interpretation, is as
                                    follows: Since such firms or persons may make external
                                    transfers, their internal operations are “related” to external
                                    transfers and hence subject to blocking control under decree
                                    110,790. Bank officials asserted that this power has already
                                    been exercised, and will submit full particulars. Previously the
                                    bank in discussions with the Embassy had questioned whether the
                                    decree conferred this power.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Bank officials also state that accounts, cash, and securities
                                    in the name of residents of Germany and Italy, as well as Japan,
                                    are blockable under earlier measures and are submitting
                                    memorandum regarding these measures and their practical
                                    operation. Since the Embassy, Department, and Treasury
                                    previously had not been aware of the authority allegedly
                                    conferred by such measures, the memorandum will be carefully
                                    studied and a report on the existence and applications of the
                                    authority will be submitted.</item>

                                    system, the following deficiencies were brought to bank
                                    officials’ attention: <list>
                                        <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                        <item>Interventors are authorized only to watch and report.
                                            Interveners require but do not have authority to prevent
                                            or suspend any transaction which appears undesirable. In
                                            the absence of such authority, undesirable transactions
                                            may be executed while the interventor’s reports are
                                            traveling through the time consuming administrative
                                            process established by decree 122,712.</item>

                                        <item>Bank officials replied that a bill endowing
                                            interventors with such powers was about to be introduced
                                            into Congress, and that a firm would probably refrain
                                            from completing the transactions questioned by an
                                            interventor because of the fear that such action would
                                            result in the immediate blocking of all of its assets by
                                            the bank (see item 1 above).</item>
                                        <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                        <item>Present decree, even if supplemented by that bill,
                                            places upon interventors burden of discovering
                                            undesirable transactions. This will be extremely
                                            difficult in view of deceptive devices which Axis firms
                                            have contrived. It was suggested that all operations of
                                            firms in which interventors are placed be blocked and
                                            that only licensed transactions be permitted. In this
                                            way the burden of justifying doubtful transactions would
                                            be imposed upon the firm under intervention (bank

                                            ownership, and to persons resident in Axis territory
                                            rather than to Axis nationals or partisans in Argentina.
                                            Bank officials adverted to administrative and political

                                            for all Axis nationals in Argentina. It was then
                                            suggested that census could initially be confined to
                                            property of persons or firms carrying on or suspected
                                            of, undesirable activities. This suggestion was
                                            favorably received.</item>

                                            and that would justify political position of Axis banks

                        <p>In their earlier informal conversations with Ministry of Finance and
                            Central Bank officials Cochran and Meltzer had been assured of the
                            sincere desire of these officials to implement Resolution V. The new
                            decrees were cited as concrete evidence. Further proof of this
                            determination was promised. Yesterday the bank officials welcomed the
                            criticisms discussed above.</p>
                        <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0500"/>
                        <p>These officials indicated a reluctance to seek legislation which would
                            confer more specific authority to control internal transactions lest
                            this intensify existing political criticism that the Central Bank has
                            excessive power over the country’s economy. However, the bank officials
                            promised immediately to attempt to tighten the decrees. They could not
                            say yesterday whether this would be through revision of the bills about
                            to be introduced or through regulations issued under the existing
                            decrees or under any new enabling legislation. They appeared anxious to
                            strengthen their administration of foreign property in order both to
                            stop undesirable transactions and to enable their delegation in
                            Washington to meet questions and criticisms offered by other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The bank officials were informed that the Embassy prior to the issuance
                            of the decrees had received instructions which would be the basis of
                            representations to appropriate officials of the Government. It was
                            suggested to the bank officials that such representations particularly
                            while the administration of the decrees was in a formative state, might
                            assist the bank in achieving its program by making the Argentine
                            Government agreeable to a vigorous implementation of Resolution V.</p>

                        <p>932. Your 1146, June 15, midnight. Please express to the appropriate
                            Argentine officials this Government’s appreciation of the steps taken by
                            Argentina to implement Resolution V as evidenced by the three recently
                            issued decrees. However, you should indicate discreetly that this
                            Government hopes that the administration of these decrees will result in
                            the implementation of the aims of Resolution V to the fullest extent and
                            that any subsequent decrees or legislation which may be found necessary
                            will be speedily enacted.</p>
                        <p>Due to the fact that the decrees by their terms apply to allied nations
                            outside the Western Hemisphere as well as to the Axis powers, the
                            Department does not feel that it should encourage any publicity until
                            the Argentine Government is prepared publicly to clarify its position on
                            this point.</p>

                            control and related matters. It was pointed out to Dr. Prebisch that
                            several months ago the Embassy had informed the Central Bank that it had
                            been instructed to discuss with the banks interested in obtaining
                            certain credits from the Export-Import Bank their relations with the
                            firms on the Proclaimed List and that after inquiring whether the
                            Central Bank would be disposed to obtain the desired information, the
                            Embassy was informed that it was preferred that it discuss the matter
                            directly with the interested banks. It was noted that several weeks ago
                            he, Dr. Prebisch, had expressed disapproval of a sentence in the
                            standardized form which the Embassy was asking the banks to sign in the
                                matter<note n="*" xml:id="d457fn92">Namely, the commitment that the
                                banks would consult with the Embassy before making remittances to
                                Axis-occupied or controlled countries or to any European neutral
                                country if any person in any Axis-occupied or controlled country had
                                an interest, giving the Embassy the full details of the contemplated
                                transaction. [Footnote in the original.]</note> on the theory that
                            this was tantamount to assuming powers of control that had been given to
                            the Central Bank by various measures (including the decrees of June 15
                            and 17, 1942); that the Embassy had not subsequently discussed such a
                            commitment with those banks which had not already subscribed to it; that
                            on August 1, Dr. Louro<note n="91" xml:id="d457fn91">Alfredo Louro,
                                official of the Banco Central.</note> had informed the Embassy of
                            his (Dr. Prebisch’s) disapproval of the Embassy’s action in requesting
                            of the Banco de la Provincia, by instruction, information concerning its
                            outstanding credit accounts with firms on the Proclaimed List now and a
                            year ago; and that the Embassy was in a quandary as to how to obtain
                            this information. Dr. Prebisch said that the Central Bank was placed in
                            a delicate position in the matter and that while he and his Bank had
                            every wish to be cooperative, this “interference” by the Embassy was
                            creating an unfavorable impression.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Prebisch was told that, as had been said on previous occasions, the
                            Embassy had not the slightest intention or desire to interfere in the
                            banking affairs of Argentina; that it did not see any semblance
                            whatsoever of interference in asking for this information from a bank
                            that had applied for a credit in the United States, especially in view
                            of the fact that the Central Bank had expressly asked the Embassy to
                            discuss the matter directly with the banks; but that if the Central <pb
                                n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0502"/>Bank took the position that it
                            did not now wish the Embassy to seek the information, it would be
                            appreciated if the Central Bank would furnish the data itself.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Prebisch said that he would endeavor to obtain the information, and
                            when asked whether he would also obtain figures relating to the Banco de
                            la Nación, the Banco Español del Rio de la Plata, and the Banco Popular
                            Argentina, irrespective of the Export-Import Bank credits, he replied
                            that he would try to obtain these also, although he added that in all
                            cases he could furnish only the global figures and not the amounts
                            according to the names of the firms receiving the credits.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Dr. Prebisch asked whether the United States Government
                            took the position that no credits should be granted to firms on the
                            Proclaimed List, even if the national economy would be thereby
                            prejudiced. He was told in reply that it would seem that the best
                            solution for all parties in such cases would be the appointment of
                            interventors who would see to it that the firms in question did not
                            apply resources to Axis uses, and that under such circumstances there
                            would not seem to be the same objection to the granting of credit
                            facilities by Argentine banks. Dr. Prebisch indicated that he was in
                            sympathy with this position and that it was his intention to proceed
                            along the lines of the reorganization in the Martini &amp; Rossi and
                            Pirelli cases. In this connection, he said that the interventors in the
                            initial thirteen firms, as well as the special inspectors in the two
                            German banks (the Embassy’s Despatch no. 5790 of July 21, 1942<note
                                n="93" xml:id="d457fn93">Not printed.</note>) had already commenced
                            their work.</p>
                        <p>When asked whether there were any recent developments regarding the two
                            draft laws covering the expropriation and management of certain
                            enterprises which were to have been submitted to Congress some weeks ago
                            (the Embassy’s Despatch no. 5598 of July 1, 1942,<note n="93"
                                xml:id="d457fn94">Not printed.</note> page 3), Dr. Prebisch replied
                            in the negative, (insofar as he knew).</p>
                        <p>Dr. Prebisch’s attention was then invited to the dollar-currency control
                            in Argentina, more specifically to the fact that while the Central Bank
                            had given assurances that the dollar-currency market would be closed,
                            with the exception of purchases and sales of up to $100 for travelers
                            traveling to and from the United States, various exchange houses were
                            continuing to quote dollar notes and that in fact a student departing
                            for the United States was known to have purchased $700 in currency from
                            such an establishment yesterday. Dr. Prebisch promised to look into this
                            matter at once and indicated that such transactions would be stopped
                            immediately.</p>

                            extended to certain Argentine banks by the Export-Import Bank of
                            Washington covering uninsurable risks and concerning also the desire of
                            the Department that these institutions furnish assurances of cooperation
                            with war-time financial measures of the United States, I have the honor
                            to report that following the receipt of the Department’s telegram under
                            reference the Embassy requested the institutions included in the
                            Embassy’s telegram no. 645 of April 10, 3 p.m.,<note n="95"
                                xml:id="d458fn93">Not printed.</note> excluding the local branches
                            of the two American Banks, to execute a form embodying the four points
                            contained in the Department’s telegram no. 827 of June 8, 11 p.m. A copy
                            and English translation of the form are enclosed herewith.<note n="95"
                                xml:id="d458fn97">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>All of these institutions have now either signed the form or furnished
                            assurances of cooperation in some other form. Shaw, Strupp and Company,
                            Ernesto Tornquist and Company, the Banco Holandés Unido, the Banco
                            Polaco P.K.O., the Société Générale, and the Argentaría S. A. de
                            Finanzas have returned the form after signing it or have supplied a
                            statement embodying in more or less the same terms the substance of the
                            form.</p>
                        <p>The Banco Francés del Río de la Plata has informed the Embassy that it is
                            not at this time interested in the credit facilities in question, but it
                            has nevertheless voluntarily furnished a statement, a translation of
                            which is enclosed herewith.<note n="95" xml:id="d458fn95">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The Banco de Italia y Río de la Plata has been reluctant to execute the
                            undertaking desired as it has considered this to be inconsistent with
                            the control exercised by the Central Bank, including the bank’s recent
                            Circular No. 293 of July 4, which prohibits banks from furnishing
                            certain information to institutions other than the Central Bank.
                            However, the Banco de Italia y Río de la Plata has been especially
                            cooperative with the British Embassy for some months as this Embassy has
                            reported in its despatches nos. 4050 of February 3, 1942, and 4211 of
                            February 24, 1942.<note n="96" xml:id="d458fn96">Neither printed.</note>
                            Señor Doretti, the General Manager of the institution, called at this
                            Embassy several weeks ago and explained that his bank was willing to
                            cooperate in every way <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0504"/>with
                            this mission, and he has subsequently furnished a letter dated July 10,
                            1942, signed by himself and the President of the bank, a copy and
                            translation of which are enclosed.<note n="98" xml:id="d458fn98">Not
                                printed.</note> Inasmuch as it is understood that the Banco de
                            Italia y Río de la Plata is in practice complying with all of the points
                            mentioned in the form, it is recommended that the statement of this bank
                            be accepted for purposes of the Export-Import Bank credits.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Banco de la Provincia, the Embassy has discussed this
                            matter a number of times with Señor Alberto Tintoré, head of the Foreign
                            Department of the bank (reference is made also to the conversations on
                            April 7 and April 9 reported in the Embassy’s despatch no. 4710 of April
                            11 last). The Banco de la Provincia has consistently taken the position
                            that while it has not been granting any new credits to firms and
                            individuals on the Proclaimed List, it cannot, as a semi-official bank
                            (one-half of its stock is owned by the Province of Buenos Aires, and it
                            is the fiscal agent of the Province) give the desired assurances
                            concerning the immediate elimination of existing credits and overdrafts.
                            Sr. Tintoré has also volunteered the information in a spirit of
                            frankness that there were instances, although they were few, in which
                            his bank was obliged to advance credit to the Province which the latter
                            might, in turn, make available to firms on the Proclaimed List for such
                            purposes as public works, but that this was a matter over which the Bank
                            had no control.</p>
                        <p>As to the furnishing of figures of outstanding credit accounts with firms
                            on the Proclaimed List, the Bank was apparently prepared to supply the
                            total figures both now and a year ago, but on August 1, the Central Bank
                            informed the Embassy that it would consider this inconsistent with the
                            Central Bank’s own control over Argentine banks. The matter was
                            discussed yesterday with Dr. Prebisch, the General Manager of the
                            Central Bank, who indicated that he would have the figures for
                            Proclaimed List accounts of the Banco de la Provincia furnished the
                            Embassy through the Central Bank (as well as figures for certain other
                            banks irrespective of the Export-Import Bank credits (as was reported in
                            the Embassy’s despatch no. 6000 of August 5, 1942<note n="99"
                                xml:id="d458fn99">Not printed, but see footnote 89, <ref
                                    target="#pg_489">p. 489</ref>.</note>). As soon as the Embassy
                            receives these figures, which it is understood will be supplied within
                            the next few days, it will transmit them to the Department by
                            telegraph.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the approval of the undertaking of the Banco de la
                            Provincia by its board of directors, it appears that it will not be
                            possible to obtain this under existing conditions. As the Department is
                            aware, the President of the Bank, Dr. Sánchez Sorondo, is sympathetic
                            towards the totalitarian countries and is not friendly towards the
                            United States, and if Dr. D’Olivera, the General Manager, should <pb
                                n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0505"/>permit the matter to be aired
                            at a meeting of the board, there is little doubt that it could cause
                            serious complications, including impairment of Dr. D’Olivera’s
                            cooperation with our Government. Dr. D’Olivera takes the position that
                            he has full authority to sign the declarations and that therefore
                            nothing would be gained by presenting the subject to the board. It has
                            also been emphasized, and Dr. Prebisch confirmed this yesterday, that
                            the President of the Banco de la Provincia has very little power in the
                            administration of the Bank, and in support of this statement there have
                            been cited the Bank’s statutes, which do in fact, appear to give the
                            President only limited powers. It is reported that Dr. Sánchez Sorondo
                            spends but very little time at the Bank, and then only to attend
                            meetings.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the desired commitment that the Bank consult with the
                            Embassy before making any remittance to Axis countries or to neutral
                            countries if for the benefit of Axis interests, Dr. Prebisch had
                            previously requested that the Embassy not ask for such an undertaking in
                            the future as the Central Bank considered that this would conflict with
                            its own control, especially by virtue of the powers conferred by the
                            decrees of June 15 and June 17.</p>
                        <p>Although the signed undertaking (copy and translation enclosed
                                herewith)<note n="1" xml:id="d458fn1">Not printed.</note> of the
                            Banco de la Provincia, even if the promised figures show a material
                            decrease in all credit accounts with Proclaimed List firms and
                            individuals, falls short of the commitments requested in the
                            Department’s telegram no. 827 of June 8, 11 p.m., it is believed that it
                            is as satisfactory as can be obtained under present conditions.
                            Moreover, it is feared that if this bank should not now be placed upon
                            the approved list of the Export-Import Bank, there would be a serious
                            danger not only that the Banco de la Provincia would feel less inclined
                            to pursue a cooperative policy but also that the Central Bank, which has
                            manifested special interest in having the former included, would feel
                            offended in the matter. Further although less important factors in the
                            case are the facts that the Banco de la Provincia is the second largest
                            bank in the country, that it is considered an exceptionally well managed
                            institution, and that it has just received much favorable publicity here
                            on the occasion of the renewal of its contract with the Province until
                            1986. It is, therefore, recommended that if the figures to be submitted
                            are not, in the circumstances, definitely unsatisfactory, the Banco de
                            la Provincia be at least tentatively included in the list of the
                            Export-Import Bank, but with the understanding that the Embassy be
                            furnished through the Central Bank with figures of Proclaimed List
                            credit accounts every six months.</p>

                        <p>A–103. Your despatch 6001, August 6. The Department is not disposed to
                            accept the modified undertaking of the Banco de la Provincia as set
                            forth in your despatch under reference. This decision has been reached
                            with the full realization that if the Banco de la Provincia is not
                            included in the approved list, the Central Bank will not permit the
                            other banks to participate in the credits of the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                        <p>It is believed in a situation of this kind, where the facilities of an
                            instrumentality of this Government are being made available, that this
                            Government is fully justified in insisting upon an undertaking on the
                            part of the recipients of the benefits of these facilities which will
                            afford some degree of assurance that the recipients will cooperate in
                            the economic warfare policies designed to strengthen the security of the
                            Western Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>The modified undertaking of the Banco de la Provincia falls far short of
                            the four points outlined in the Department’s 827, June 8, 11 p.m., which
                            the Department considers to be the minimum requirements of a
                            satisfactory undertaking. It does not even contain an assurance that no
                            new credits or overdrafts will be granted to Proclaimed List nationals;
                            it merely states that the Banco de la Provincia will <pb n="495"
                                xml:id="pg_495" facs="0507"/>not invest the proceeds of the credits
                            received from the Export-Import Bank in operations benefiting such
                            nationals. It is true that in a backhanded manner, the Banco de la
                            Provincia has stated that it has decided “not to conduct credit
                            operations with new ‘enlisted’ clients” but this at most means that the
                            bank will not take new undesirable accounts and in no way limits the
                            bank in granting new credits, et cetera, to the numerous Proclaimed List
                            accounts already on the bank’s books. The second point in the
                            Department’s suggested undertaking is not answered at all. The Banco de
                            la Provincia does not agree in any way to eliminate existing credits and
                            overdrafts of Proclaimed List nationals; it merely refers to the fact
                            that such credits and overdrafts are being reduced due to the curtailing
                            of the business of Proclaimed List nationals, which fact is in no way
                            attributable to any policy of the bank. The third and fourth points of
                            the Department’s suggested undertaking are evaded by reference to the
                            purported controls of the Central Bank, which, as you well know, have as
                            yet shown no signs of being enforced effectively.</p>
                        <p>The undertaking of the Banco de Italia y Río de la Plata is likewise
                            considered unsatisfactory. It is so vague in its terms as to be
                            practically meaningless. If that bank is as cooperative as you state and
                            is in effect complying with all the points of the Department’s suggested
                            undertaking, it is difficult to understand why it does not wish to
                            confirm this in writing.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that a further approach to Prebisch might result in the
                            giving of satisfactory undertakings by both the Banco de la Provincia
                            and the Banco de Italia y Río de la Plata. You should indicate to
                            Prebisch that the points embodied in the Department’s suggested
                            undertaking represent the putting into operation of the basic provisions
                            of the resolutions of the recent Inter-American Conference on Systems of
                            Economic and Financial Controls<note n="3" xml:id="d460fn3">For
                                correspondence concerning this Conference, see <ref target="#pg_58"

                            and that the Central Bank, having subscribed to these resolutions,
                            should certainly not want to place any obstacles in the way of
                            activating them. You should also indicate to Prebisch that undertakings
                            by the individual banks will afford the Central Bank ancillary and
                            independent method of enforcing the Central Bank’s own controls. With
                            respect to the psychological argument that the giving of undertakings by
                            the individual banks is inconsistent with the controls exercised by the
                            Central Bank, you should inform Prebisch that the known pressure exerted
                            by the Foreign Office leaves the Department with no alternative but to
                            recognize that the Central Bank’s controls of necessity have to be
                            relaxed frequently irrespective of what the independent desires of the
                            Central Bank may be. It is believed that this <pb n="496"
                                xml:id="pg_496" facs="0508"/>argument, if cautiously presented, will
                            in no way offend the Central Bank and may well strengthen the hand of
                            the Central Bank in its attempts to resist the pressure of the Foreign
                            Office. In the event, however, that the above outlined approach to
                            Prebisch should prove fruitless, it may be that the Central Bank, as the
                            agency in which the control over banking operations is centralized, will
                            be willing to give the appropriate undertaking on behalf of all the
                            interested banks.</p>
                        <p>Should the appropriate undertaking be forthcoming from the Banco de la
                            Provincia, the Department is willing to forego the approval by the
                            bank’s board of directors provided the undertaking is signed by
                            D’Olivera and you are satisfied that he has full power to sign.</p>
                        <p>The Department has noted that the Banco del Río de la Plata is not
                            interested in the credits at this time. As a consequence, its name will
                            not be included in the approved list with the understanding that it may
                            be included at a future date, if it so desires, upon the giving of an
                            appropriate undertaking.</p>
                        <p>For your information, the Export-Import Bank has informed the Department
                            that for non-political reasons the Banco Polaco P.K.O. is not being

                            “interventors” in thirteen Axis-controlled firms here by authority of
                            Decree no. 122,712 of June 15, 1942, I have the honor to report that
                            occasion was taken in a conversation at the Central Bank this morning to
                            ask Dr. Alfredo Louro of that institution what the results of these
                            investigations had thus far been. Dr. Louro, who appeared to speak with
                            much frankness, stated that the first phase of the investigations,
                            consisting of efforts to ascertain to what extent contributions were
                            being made by these German organizations for political purposes, was now
                            virtually completed and that the interventors had reported almost no
                            irregularities. Dr. Louro mentioned as perhaps the principal disclosure
                            the fact that the Merck Company had made a payment to the Nazi newspaper
                                <hi rend="italic">El Pampero</hi> but said that this was connected
                                <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0510"/>with advertizing which had
                            been contracted for previous to Decree No. 110,790 of January 8, 1942
                            (see the Embassy’s despatch no. 3865 of January 13, 1942<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d463fn11">Not printed.</note>). According to Dr. Louro,
                            there have been contributions to various German organizations, such as
                            athletic clubs, but he said that these were considered to have bona fide
                            commercial or good-will value and were not of a political character. He
                            stated that one of the thirteen firms had asked for permission to make a
                            lump contribution to the German “Winterhilfe” fund (the Embassy’s
                            despatch no. 6722 of August [<hi rend="italic">September</hi>] 23,
                                1942<note n="11" xml:id="d463fn12">Not printed.</note> but that the
                            bank had denied this request, taking the view that the contributions
                            should be made directly by individuals within the firm.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Louro said that the next phase of the investigation would have as its
                            purpose the ascertaining of the extent to which political activities are
                            being financed through misleading commercial guises, such as
                            over-payments for merchandise and services, portions of which might be
                            used for financing German activities. He remarked that this would
                            naturally be a more difficult task than the investigation concerning
                            contributions.</p>
                        <p>As to the personnel being used in the investigations, Dr. Louro stated
                            that the interventors were well-qualified income-tax inspectors, that at
                            least one such inspector was assigned to each concern, and that it was
                            intended to have these same persons continue with the next phase of the
                            investigations.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy will continue to keep in close contact with the Central Bank
                            in regard to the investigations and will not fail to make available to
                            the appropriate officers of that institution such data in the Embassy’s
                            files concerning the experiences of the United States in analogous cases
                            as might seem helpful.</p>
                        <p>According to Dr. Louro, a list of additional German firms to be
                            intervened is now being prepared by the Central Bank.</p>

                        <p>247. Your despatch no. 6720, September 23, 1942. All contributions by
                            business enterprises to pro-Axis organizations can, of course,
                            theoretically be attributed to commercial motives and the desire for
                            business goodwill. However, it is believed that in a large majority of
                            the cases an examination of the activities of the organizations involved
                            and of the commercial advantage which could reasonably be expected to
                            flow from contributions would indicate that the primary motive behind
                            contributions is political, rather than economic. In this connection it
                            would be helpful if the Central Bank would furnish the Embassy with a
                            list of the contributions involved and if the Embassy would examine
                            those contributions with a view to determining their commercial
                            justification, if any. For example, contributions by a producer of raw
                            materials, as distinguished from a retailer, would be difficult to
                            attribute to commercial motives.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Dr. Louro’s statement that the Bank would deny firms
                            authorization to make contributions to the German “Winterhilfe” fund,
                            but that the bank took the view that such contributions should be made
                            directly by individuals within the firm, it should be observed that
                            Resolution VII passed by the Inter-American Conference on Systems of
                            Economic and Financial Control reaches transactions by natural persons,
                            as well as those by business enterprises, if those transactions
                            prejudice the political and economic independence or security of the
                            hemisphere. It would seem, therefore, that <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500"
                                facs="0512"/>under that Resolution, if contributions by firms or
                            enterprises are banned on political grounds, individuals should also be
                            prohibited from making those contributions. It is, of course,
                            immaterial, from the standpoint of hemispheric security, whether a
                            contribution to an undesirable organization is made by a business firm
                            as a firm, or by individuals within that firm. It is suggested that you
                            call this fact to the attention of the appropriate officers of the
                            Central Bank.</p>
                        <p>Please keep the Department informed.</p>

                                xml:id="d466fn14">Not printed.</note> The Embassy agrees that it
                            would be desirable to include on the Proclaimed List any exchange houses
                            continuing to trade in dollar currency in violation of the established

                        <p>The principal developments have been in the field of dollar-currency
                            control. On October 8, inspectors of the Central Bank raided fifteen <pb
                                n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0513"/>exchange shops that were more
                            or less openly violating the Argentine prohibitions on trade in United
                            States currency and the Central Bank has subsequently kept the situation
                            so well under control that the black market has become small and very
                            restricted (Embassy’s telegram no. 2003, October 14, 11 p.m. and
                            despatch no. 7092 of October 26, 1942<note n="16" xml:id="d467fn16"
                                >Neither printed.</note>). This action was taken after the Embassy
                            had discussed the matter on a number of occasions at the Central Bank,
                            furnishing the Bank with a copy of a report of an extensive
                            investigation made into the operations of the exchange shops, and after
                            the subject had been taken up with the Foreign Office by a note dated
                            October 5, 1942, pursuant to the Department’s telegram no. 1489 of
                            October 3, 7 p.m.<note n="17" xml:id="d467fn17">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Following the reduction from $250 to $50 as the amount which travellers
                            may take with them into the United States, the Central Bank informally
                            advised the banks and exchange shops that they should decrease from $100
                            to $50 the amount of dollar currency which travellers proceeding from
                            here to the United States may purchase in the local market, and it is
                            understood that definite instructions in the matter will be issued
                            shortly.</p>
                        <p>By a circular (No. 310) dated October 16, 1942, the Central Bank has
                            required the banks that send dollar currency to the United States in
                            accordance with the established procedure to report these shipments to
                            the Central Bank. It will be recalled that the Bank had informed the
                            Embassy on October 10 that it could not furnish, for checking purposes,
                            the figures for currency shipments as it did not have these figures
                            (Embassy’s despatch no. 6972 of October 14, 1942<note n="17"
                                xml:id="d467fn19">Not printed.</note>). Presumably the Central Bank
                            had not required these reports originally because of its wish to avoid
                            giving any appearance to the public of being involved in the individual
                            shipments, realizing that in many of these cases the currency would not
                            be released.</p>
                        <p>No important freezing measures have been adopted during the month.</p>

                            national, was collecting such documents for the purpose of taking them

                            have been thus removed it will inform the Central Bank and suggest that

                            funds held in their names in the United States. Also, all of France
                            within continental Europe has been declared by the United States
                            Government to be enemy territory for purposes of restrictions against

                            France had been regarded as enemy territory. This action has been taken
                            by the Secretary of the Treasury by means of an amendment of the
                            definition of “enemy territory” in General Ruling No. 11 of the Treasury

                        <p>Inasmuch as the Government at Vichy is known to be controlled by the
                            governments of the aggressor countries, more especially by the German
                            Government, it is hoped that the Government of Argentina will see fit to
                            adopt similar economic and financial measures with respect to France and
                            assets of the French Government within Argentina, with a view
                            particularly to preventing the large withdrawals of funds which may be
                            attempted immediately. Similarly, it is hoped that appropriate controls
                            may be applied to the properties of any French nationals within
                            Argentine territory who are known to be giving support to the aggressor
                            nations either directly or through other countries, including those
                            dominated by the aggressor nations. Such collaboration on the part of
                            Argentina would necessarily add much to the effectiveness of the steps
                            taken by the United States Government.</p>

                            the Foreign Office protesting against the authorization of remittances
                            to the head office of the Banco Hipotecario in France and point out the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>Shortly after the collapse of France in June 1940, there was an
                            accumulation of three or four hundred million francs in the account of
                            the Central Bank under the Argentine-French Payments Agreement.
                            Subsequently this Government was informed that when this fund became
                            exhausted, Argentina would not authorize further transfers of payments
                            to occupied or unoccupied France for the duration of the war. On April
                            9, 1942 it was learned that authorization had been granted for two
                            substantial financial remittances to occupied France and that these
                            remittances were entirely outside the Argentine-French Payment
                            Agreement. The Foreign Office was informed that this Government
                            considered these remittances a violation of Rio Resolution V. The
                            Foreign Office, under date of May 8, 1942, submitted a memorandum to the
                            effect that the remittances in question did not constitute a violation
                            of Resolution V. This Government, after giving careful consideration to
                            this memorandum, presented the reasons which, in its judgment, made it
                            necessary for it to continue to consider the transactions involved
                            inconsistent with Resolution V.</p>
                        <p>This Government has recently learned that the Argentine authorities have
                            authorized further remittances of substantial amounts by the Banco
                            Hipotecario Franco-Argentina to its head office in France and that these
                            remittances are to be effected outside the French-Argentine Payments
                            Agreement. For the reasons which this Government has previously
                            presented remittances made by the Banco Hipotecario in the past have
                            afforded facilities in France which might benefit the aggressor nations.
                            Accordingly, even before the recent developments in France, it was the
                            carefully considered view of this Government, that the authorizations in
                            question were inconsistent not only with Resolution V adopted in Rio but
                            also with resolutions adopted by <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0518"
                            />the Washington Conference. As a result of recent developments in
                            France, it is now even clearer to this Government that such remittances
                            in the future would benefit the aggressor nations. Indeed such
                            remittances can no longer, in their practical effect, be distinguished
                            from remittances direct to Germany. Accordingly, their authorization
                            would be viewed with the greatest concern by this Government. It is
                            hoped that the renewed expression of this Government’s views, together
                            with new developments in France, will result in denial of authorizations
                            for such transactions in the future.</p>

                                instruction transmitted a proposal of the Treasury Department to
                                apply freezing action or revoke licenses of certain firms (840.51
                                Frozen Credits/8222).</note> The Embassy after a full consideration
                            of all factors definitely recommends that the Banco de la Provincia and
                            the Banco de la Nación not be subject to <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi>
                            freezing at this time.</p>
                        <p>While the intercept and other material dealing with the operations of the
                            banks may justify freezing, the action, directed against the two largest
                            banks in this country, one a governmental institution and the other a
                            semi-governmental one, would unquestionably alienate the Central Bank,
                            gravely imperil the negotiations now under way looking towards the
                            over-all control of subversive activities in Argentina and the cutting
                            off of all code communications with Europe, and possibly precipitate
                            serious reprisals against American interests in Argentina.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has the same objective in mind as the Treasury Department,
                            namely, cutting off all financial transactions with enemy territory and
                            enemy nationals, as well as all transactions either direct or indirect,
                            of benefit to the Axis. It admits that in attempting to attain this
                            objective it can probably count but little in the line of active
                            cooperation of the Government but it feels that any hope of
                            accomplishment would be destroyed by the proposed action of the
                            [Treasury?].</p>
                        <p>The Economic Counselor this afternoon discussed without gloves the entire
                            subject of financial controls with Prebisch who definitely stated that
                            he had sufficient powers to limit remittances in accordance with the
                            provisions of Resolution I of Washington Conference. He is willing to
                            examine with us possibility of tightening these controls <pb n="507"
                                xml:id="pg_507" facs="0519"/>to the point where they will be
                            satisfactory to Treasury Department. He further offered to carry out an
                            inspection of all foreign dollar holdings, including securities, of
                            Argentine banks and to block any found to be the property of the Axis;
                            he is also willing unofficially to recognize the Proclaimed List outside
                            of Argentina in connection with approval or disapproval of remittances
                            and to give every facility to carry out a study of Argentine controls in
                            relation to Rio and Washington Resolutions. As concerns credits and
                            loans to Proclaimed List nationals within Argentina by Argentine banks
                            Prebisch stated that so far he had no power to discriminate although he
                            has already used his influence to the end that loans not be provided for
                            expansion and he is willing to discuss the extension of the interventor
                            system and other measures of control.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy does not wish to prophesy success for its proposed program of
                            action. It feels, however, that a joint study of the control system
                            here, to which Messrs. Mann and Skelton<note n="29" xml:id="d472fn29"

                            would be assigned, holds more possibilities for constructive attainment
                            than the freezing of the two banks.</p>
                        <p>I therefore recommend most strongly that the proposed action should not
                            be taken.</p>

                                printed.</note> This afternoon the Central Bank outlined its
                            position with reference to action reported in Department’s 1775,
                            November 20, 9 p.m.<note n="30" xml:id="d473fn31">Not printed.</note>
                            Central Bank stated that it felt only two avenues were open to the
                            Treasury Department, (1) either to consider Argentina as a neutral
                            country and apply the controls in that manner, or (2) to consider
                            Argentina as a member of the hemisphere block and have confidence in the
                            controls exercised by the Central Bank. The bank recognized that
                            Argentina actually fell in neither of these categories. In his [<hi
                                rend="italic">its?</hi>] judgment it could not totally cut off
                            financial relations with the Axis until political relations had been
                            broken by the Government, but felt that it had made an honest attempt to
                            cooperate in the implementation of the Washington Resolutions and that
                            it had not fallen far short of compliance with those Resolutions. It
                            admitted that it had been unable to go as far as <pb n="508"
                                xml:id="pg_508" facs="0520"/>the Treasury might desire, but felt
                            that the cooperation given the United States by the Central Bank was far
                            from neutral and even hazardous considering Government’s position.</p>
                        <p>It stated that the action taken by the Treasury Department against the
                            Banco de la Provincia and the Banco de la Nación was a very grave step
                            since, if the action had been taken as a result of remittances by those
                            banks, the Treasury Department should have penalized the Central Bank
                            which was the responsible party rather than the institutions themselves.
                            Furthermore should any remittances have been made by the banks without
                            the approval of the Central Bank the matter then became one for action
                            by the Central Bank rather than by the Treasury Department. The Central
                            Bank stated that it must request information of the Treasury Department
                            as to the concrete reasons for having taken the action since, unless it
                            could tell the local banks exactly why the action had been taken, its
                            moral authority would be completely undermined.</p>
                        <p>The offer made yesterday by Prebisch to study the entire situation with
                            officers of the Embassy was re-emphasized and the bank stated that it
                            would give every facility for a thorough joint survey. It is willing
                            clearly to define the extent to which it can go so that the Treasury
                            Department will know exactly what is possible, but it feels that the
                            Treasury Department will have to work either with or against the
                            bank.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy feels that at the present moment neither the Treasury nor the
                            Department is in possession of sufficient facts to determine definitely
                            whether the cooperation of the Central Bank is of greater value than the
                            sum total of remittances which take place and it feels that it would be
                            extremely unwise for any drastic action to be taken by the Treasury
                            Department until the facts are established. The Embassy is not
                            requesting an indefinite stay of action on the part of the Treasury, but
                            it does request a reasonable time in which to go to the bottom of the
                            entire question of financial controls.</p>
                        <p>The bank is ready to start discussions and it requests an immediate reply
                            with regard to the specific charges against the Banco de la Provincia
                            and the Banco de la Nación. The Embassy wishes to warn the Department
                            that the conversations which have taken place were completely without
                            protocol and hence the information given herein regarding the attitude
                            of the Central Bank should not be discussed in any way with the
                            Argentine Embassy in Washington and must otherwise be kept
                            confidential.</p>
                        <p>A reply to the Central Bank’s request and an authorization to enter into
                            discussions with the bank would be appreciated by Saturday at the
                            latest.</p>

                            in your 2367. The information which was the basis for denying new
                            credits to the Banco de la Provincia and the Banco de la Nación is being
                            revised and will probably be made available to the Central Bank. Please
                            do not make any commitments in this connection. It may be desirable to
                            indicate that the two banks and the Central Bank must already be aware
                            of the reasons underlying the Treasury action.</p>
                        <p>You are authorized to undertake with the Central Bank such discussions of
                            the Argentine controls as you deem appropriate. It is requested,
                            however, that you not give the impression that the extension of United
                            States controls will be suspended until the discussions are completed.
                            In connection with these discussions, you might point out to the Central
                            Bank that it would be helpful if the Department, as a first step, could
                            be promptly furnished with the following information regarding the two

                                            been exercised, and some remittances benefiting the Axis
                                            have been going forward from Argentina. Whether those

                                            to eliminate pro-Axis transactions. It is recognized, of
                                            course, that there are some marginal cases which the
                                            Central Bank may handle along lines designed to protect
                                            allied interest, notwithstanding that the Foreign Office
                                            might pursue a different approach. However, basically,

                                            the commercial activities of Proclaimed List nationals,
                                            the Department would welcome the Embassy’s comments as

                                            connection it will be helpful to know whether Proclaimed

                                            and who are in a position to expand their commercial
                                            operations have experienced any difficulty in securing
                                            the necessary credit. With respect to Proclaimed List
                                            nationals adversely affected by our controls, there
                                            would, of course, be little occasion for expansion, and
                                            if such cases arose, it would appear that prudent
                                            private banking would dictate against the expansion of
                                            credit to such Proclaimed List nationals.</item>

                            and Treasury during conference was merely a statement of Argentine
                            controls as they then existed and was discussed with the Department and
                            Treasury on that basis. It was a statement of the <pb n="514"
                                xml:id="pg_514" facs="0526"/>Argentine position but was not at any
                            time considered by the Treasury or the Department as an interpretation

                            such with the Argentine delegates. Gagneux’s statement that a
                            gentleman’s agreement was made between the Argentine delegates, the
                            Department and the Treasury is contrary to our understanding and any
                            such agreement would obviously be counter to the procedure of

                            drafted by Argentina and that a continuance of the remittances referred

                                    >Supra</hi>.</note> President assured me today that indication
                            in telegram from Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to Anze that its
                            three points were prerequisite to breaking off relations with Axis
                            Powers was result of hasty drafting; that points were merely outline of
                            economic and defense aid which it was hoped the United States would be
                            able to give Bolivia in due course.</p>
                        <p>The President stated categorically that decree breaking off relations
                            would be issued in 2 or 3 days at the latest and that delay was due
                            solely to necessity for first taking steps to protect mines and other
                            strategic points and to deal with dangerous Axis nationals. In support
                            of this he mentioned minor sabotage which has been attempted in last few
                            days.</p>
                        <p>The President also showed great perturbation over vulnerability of
                            Bolivian mines to attack by carrier-based Japanese aircraft having
                            received note from Japanese Chargé d’Affaires making threats if
                            relations are broken.</p>
                        <p>He asked me to ascertain whether it would be possible to secure temporary
                            stationing in Bolivia of at least a flight of United States Army pursuit
                            planes pending the arrival of planes and anti-aircraft artillery which
                            Bolivia has requested under Lend-Lease.<note n="9" xml:id="d480fn9">For

                                1941.”</note> He stressed that this should not be taken as offering
                            of air bases and that actual use of planes for patrol and other purposes
                            would be by agreement between their commander and Bolivian military
                            authorities. He added that he was not now making a request for such
                            planes but would make it if they were available and details would be
                            arranged.</p>
                        <p>If planes could be made available from Canal Zone or elsewhere I believe
                            it would have very beneficial effect. Their presence would bolster
                            morale of weak Bolivian Government and people and might have salutary
                            influence on Chile and Argentina. Undoubtedly some <pb n="517"

                                military aviation mission …”</note> could be worked out if thought
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>My impression from conversations yesterday and today is that Bolivians
                            hoped to get definite commitments from us on three points before
                            breaking off relations but that they have abandoned this in fear that
                            economic cooperation will be endangered if they delay breach, having
                            gotten this idea from telegrams from Anze and Zulme.</p>
                        <p>They are, however, honestly panicky about sabotage and possibility of
                            attack. That they have been warned of possibility of sabotage
                            continually since December 7 by Legation and have taken no action until
                            faced by necessity for breaking off relations is beside the point. What
                            is essential now is to calm them and help them organize to deal with
                            possible danger.</p>
                        <p>In addition to arrangements if possible for sending of United States Army
                            Air Corps detachment recommend strongly that an experienced field
                            officer of Air Corps be sent immediately to head aviation mission
                            (present chief is in Panama on sick leave and will probably not return)

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the third paragraph of
                            my telegram No. 41 of January 27, 3 p.m., in which it was stated that
                            the Bolivian Government had received a note from the Japanese Chargé
                            d’Affaires ad interim threatening Bolivia if diplomatic relations should
                            be broken off, I have the honor to report that this note was read to me
                            by the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs in the presence of the
                            President on January 27.</p>
                        <p>The note, couched in execrable Spanish, partook of the nature of an
                            ultimatum. It started out by referring to the “glorious Japanese
                            victories” and the forthcoming consolidation of the “Greater East Asia
                            Sphere of Co-Prosperity”, said that Japan expected to renew its
                            commercial relations with the countries of Latin America “even before
                            the termination of the War”, remarked that the United States had
                            promised to buy Latin American surplus raw products and to <pb n="518"
                                xml:id="pg_518" facs="0530"/>furnish its countries with needed
                            finished materials but would be unable to do so because of its critical
                            economic position, added that Japan had no designs upon Latin America,
                            commented upon the fact that “certain discussions are going on at Rio de
                            Janeiro”, stated that “the countries of South America do not appear to
                            take a breach of relations seriously” but that Japan does as a step
                            toward which would lead inevitably to War “with grave prejudice to those
                            foolhardy enough to take the step” and warned Bolivia that, if it should
                            break off relations, the consequences would be its own
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>The Peruvian Minister to Bolivia<note n="12" xml:id="d481fn12">José
                                Enrique Bustamante y Corzo.</note> has informed me that he has been
                            advised that his Government had received an “impertinent” note from the
                            Japanese Minister in Lima warning it of the consequences of a breach of
                            relations. It would thus appear that the note delivered in La Paz was a
                            circular sent from the Japanese Foreign Office to its missions in South
                            America or the local Chargé d’Affaires’ interpretation of general
                            instructions.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs told me today that neither the
                            Italian Minister nor the German Chargé d’Affaires ad interim had made
                            any representations to the Bolivian authorities in regard to a possible
                            breach of relations, either by note or orally, as reported in my

                                    severed diplomatic relations with Germany, Italy, and Japan.</p>

                        <p>The firm position taken by the Bolivian Government in severing relations
                            with Axis powers is profoundly gratifying to me personally, and I wish

                            Nos. 40 of January 26, 8 p.m., and 41 of January 27, 3 p.m., both in
                            regard to negotiations at Rio de Janeiro between the Bolivian Minister
                            of Foreign Affairs and the Undersecretary in regard to certain economic
                            questions affecting Bolivia and the United States.</p>
                        <p>As I reported to the Undersecretary at Rio de Janeiro in a telegram dated
                            January 28, 1 p.m., which was not repeated to the Department, I have
                            seen most of the exchange of telegrams between the Bolivian Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs, in Rio de Janeiro, and his Government covering the
                            various problems discussed at Rio de Janeiro, i. e., the question of
                            Bolivia’s breaking diplomatic relations with the Axis powers, that of
                            the establishment of a Bolivian Development Corporation and that of the
                            settlement of the Standard Oil problem in Bolivia.<note n="16"

                            the President and others by the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <p>Prior to Dr. Anze Matienzo’s departure for Rio de Janeiro, I had had
                            extensive conversations with him about all of these matters. He had
                            assured me of his complete support for a general breach of relations
                            with the Axis powers by all of the American Republics. As stated in my
                            telegrams Nos. 6 of January 5, 2 p.m.,<note n="17" xml:id="d484fn17">Not

                                    >p. 586</ref>.</note> to the Undersecretary, Dr. Anze Matienzo
                            had made it clear that he hoped to get Mr. Welles to sign some sort of a
                            commitment for implementing the plan of economic cooperation between the
                            two countries and to make an attempt to settle the Standard Oil question
                            while at the Rio de Janeiro Consultative Meeting.</p>

                            instead of relying on Dr. Anze Matienzo’s rather vague ideas that Mr.

                        <p>So far as the Standard Oil question was concerned, Dr. Anze Matienzo told
                            me that he had secured President Peñaranda’s permission to take the
                            matter up at Rio de Janeiro somewhat against the President’s own
                            judgment but that he was willing to stake his political future on
                            reaching a settlement and pushing it through on his return from Rio de
                            Janeiro. In our conversations, we discussed possible formulas and
                            amounts which might be paid which coincide closely with the agreement
                            finally reached between Dr. Anze Matienzo and Mr. Herman A. Metzger,
                            representative of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, as quoted in
                            the Department’s telegram No. 39 of January 28, 9 p.m.<note n="22"
                                xml:id="d484fn22"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_587"
                                    >p. 587</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>It seemed advisable to have Mr. Bohan go to Rio de Janeiro to assist in
                            the conversations since he was the originator of the plan for a Bolivian
                            Development Corporation and since the carrying out of any commitments
                            which might be made at Rio de Janeiro would fall to the Economic Mission
                            and the Development Corporation. Furthermore, I had discussed with him
                            at length the ideas of Dr. Anze Matienzo concerning a Standard Oil
                            settlement and it seemed that he could assist in that matter also. I
                            accordingly telegraphed to the Undersecretary at Rio de Janeiro under
                            date of January 9, 3 p.m.,<note n="23" xml:id="d484fn23">Not
                                printed.</note> suggesting that Mr. Bohan be detailed to Rio de
                            Janeiro to assist in the conversations with Dr. Anze Matienzo. The
                            Undersecretary replied in a telegram of January 13, 1 p.m.,<note n="23"
                                xml:id="d484fn24">Not printed.</note> asking that Mr. Bohan go to
                            Rio de Janeiro immediately and this was confirmed by the Department in
                            its telegram No. 17 of January 14, 2 p.m.<note n="23" xml:id="d484fn29"
                                >Not printed.</note> Mr. Bohan left on the latter date.</p>
                        <p>I had also arranged with Dr. Anze Matienzo before his departure to have
                            Mr. Guillermo Mariaca go to Rio de Janeiro if Mr. Bohan were detailed
                            there. Mr. Mariaca is the Bolivian official who has been most sensible
                            in his approach to the Standard Oil problem and has for years endeavored
                            in every way possible to support a settlement when no other Bolivian
                            authority would touch the matter. It seemed evident that ensuring his
                            advice for Dr. Anze Matienzo would be helpful toward the objective of a
                            fair settlement.</p>
                        <p>On January 26 after the Consultative Meeting was under way, the Acting
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Justo Rodas Eguino, showed me telegrams
                            from Dr. Anze Matienzo in which the latter described in general terms
                            the agreements he was reaching with the Undersecretary <pb n="522"
                                xml:id="pg_522" facs="0534"/>in regard to the Bolivian Development
                            Corporation, covering an authorized capital of $25,000,000 and a loan
                            from the Export-Import Bank of $10,000,000, as well as the proposed
                            Standard Oil settlement. Dr. Anze Matienzo urged strongly that the
                            Bolivian Cabinet take action to break diplomatic relations with the Axis
                            powers and that he be authorized to announce at the Consultative Meeting
                            that this had been done.</p>
                        <p>When he handed me these telegrams, Mr. Rodas Eguino also showed me his
                            reply, stating that it had been drawn up at a Cabinet meeting and
                            approved by the President and Cabinet. This reply did not touch on the
                            Standard Oil questions. It told Dr. Anze Matienzo that he could announce
                            at the Consultative Meeting that the Bolivian Government confirmed its
                            intention to break relations with the Axis powers (not that it had done
                            so) and asked him to secure commitments from the Undersecretary that: <list>

                        <p rend="flushleft">It was stated clearly in the telegram to Dr. Anze
                            Matienzo that these were to be considered as a “preliminary” to breaking
                            relations. While the telegram did not say when the Bolivian Government
                            would break relations with the Axis powers, Mr. Rodas Eguino told me
                            that this would take place within two or three days <hi rend="italic"
                                >if</hi> the above conditions were met.</p>
                        <p>I accordingly telegraphed a summary of the telegram and conversation to
                            the Undersecretary and repeated this to the Department as my telegram
                            No. 40.<note n="25" xml:id="d484fn25">Dated January 26, 8 p.m., <ref

                        <p>The Undersecretary’s reply of January 27, 4 p.m.,<note n="26"

                                January 27, 6 p.m.; not printed.</note> which does not appear to
                            have been repeated to the Department, stated that Dr. Anze Matienzo had
                            made no suggestions to him touching in the slightest degree on the
                            points outlined above. He added that it was the understanding in Rio de
                            Janeiro, confirmed by press reports, that relations between Bolivia and
                            the Axis powers had been broken on January 26.</p>
                        <p>From this telegram and subsequent conversations with Mr. Rodas Eguino and
                            President Peñaranda, it seems obvious that Dr. Anze <pb n="523"
                                xml:id="pg_523" facs="0535"/>Matienzo did not comply with his
                            Government’s instructions because (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of his
                            realization that its desires could not be met and (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>) his willingness to fight through ratification of the
                            agreements he was reaching with Mr. Welles on his return to La Paz with
                            the assistance of Mr. Luis F. Guachalla, Bolivian Minister to the United
                            States, a member of his delegation who has considerable prestige in
                            Bolivia through his successful representation of Bolivian interests in
                            the United States. It likewise appears probable that Dr. Anze Matienzo
                            deliberately declared that his Government had broken relations with the
                            Axis powers in an attempt to force its hand, realizing that the
                            Government was wavering and being convinced himself of the advisability
                            of such action as promptly as possible. These actions of Dr. Anze
                            Matienzo were, of course, in the real interest of improved relations
                            between the two countries and required very considerable courage. I
                            reported the above conclusions to the Undersecretary in a telegram dated
                            January 28, 1 p.m., but did not repeat it to the Department.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, concerning the question of the supposed breach in
                            relations, Dr. Anze Matienzo’s statement at Rio de Janeiro had caused
                            his Government considerable anxiety. Relations had <hi rend="italic"
                                >not</hi> been broken and the Bolivian Government was not certain
                            when it would take the action and yet it did not wish to disavow its
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs completely. It consequently … issued an
                            official communiqué, published in the morning press of January 27, 1942,
                            reading as follows, in translation: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In accordance with the decision taken at the last Cabinet
                                    meeting, the Foreign Office has instructed the Bolivian
                                    delegation at Rio de Janeiro to state at the Consultative
                                    Meeting of American Foreign Ministers that the Government
                                    ratifies its adherence to the formula, already approved,
                                    recommending the breaking of relations with the Axis powers.
                                    Consequently, the decree putting this attitude into effect will
                                    be promulgated in due course.”</p>

                        <p>On January 27, 1942, I saw President Peñaranda in the company of Mr.
                            Rodas Eguino and presented certain arguments to him in favor of an
                            immediate breach of relations. These appeared to have some effect on him
                            and he promised me that the appropriate decree would be forthcoming
                            within two or three days, assuring me that the telegram to Dr. Anze
                            Matienzo setting forth the commitments he should get from the
                            Undersecretary were not, as stated in the telegram, a prerequisite to a
                            breach of relations but merely an outline of what the Bolivian
                            Government hoped the United States would do for Bolivia eventually. The
                            President explained that the delay in issuing the decree was caused
                            solely by the necessity for taking precautionary measures to prevent
                            sabotage, etc., by Axis elements. The foregoing <pb n="524"
                                xml:id="pg_524" facs="0536"/>was reported to the Department in my

                            summary to the Undersecretary.</p>
                        <p>The President interrupted a Cabinet meeting to hold this half-hour
                            conversation with me. The decree breaking off relations with the Axis
                            powers was issued thirty hours later. Cabinet officers inform me that my
                            conversation with the President and the fact that Dr. Anze Matienzo had
                            stated that Bolivia had broken off relations were the two deciding
                            factors, the President not having been certain whether Bolivia should
                            not delay indefinitely and follow Argentina and Chile’s lead until the
                            conversation.</p>
                        <p>Either Dr. Anze Matienzo has not yet fully informed his Government of the
                            agreements he reached at Rio de Janeiro with Mr. Welles and Mr. Metzger,
                            or it has not understood them. Unfortunately, instead of awaiting his
                            arrival, not scheduled until mid-February because of a trip to Buenos
                            Aires, or that of Mr. Guachalla, who is due in La Paz tomorrow, the
                            Bolivian Government spokesmen have made wild statements as to what was
                            agreed upon at Rio de Janeiro, including statements that Bolivia would
                            get a credit of $40,000,000 in connection with the Development
                            Corporation instead of the $10,000,000 which was agreed upon (this is
                            apparently based upon the fact that Dr. Anze Matienzo was asked to have
                            the authorized capital made $40,000,000 in lieu of $25,000,000; Mr.
                            Rodas Eguino has persisted in disregarding the difference between
                            authorized capital and the conditional Export-Import Bank Loan of
                            $10,000,000 to the Corporation despite my continued efforts to make him
                            understand the difference). … There is enclosed a translation of an

                        <p>A further example of the Bolivian Government’s loose giving of publicity
                            to its aspirations instead of the realities may be found in an official
                            communiqué with regard to the Standard Oil settlement issued by the
                            Office of the President and published in the morning press of February
                            1, 1942. This reads, in translation: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    would furthermore be declared that neither Bolivia nor the
                                    Standard Oil Company has any claims pending, the right of

                        <p>Mr. Rodas Eguino has shown me much of the telegraphic correspondence
                            exchanged between him and Dr. Anze Matienzo in regard to the Standard
                            Oil question. Dr. Anze Matienzo informed him of the proposed terms
                            whereby $1,500,000 plus interest from March 1937 would be paid by the
                            Bolivian Government to the Standard Oil Company and the Export-Import
                            Bank would open a credit of $5,000,000 for Bolivian petroleum
                            development. To this, the Bolivian Government replied suggesting that
                            the payment to the Standard Oil Company be reduced to $1,000,000 and the
                            credit from the Export-Import Bank increased to $5,500,000. Dr. Anze
                            Matienzo answered that this was impracticable. Nevertheless, the
                            Bolivian Government has now announced to its public that the terms being
                            considered are the ones it would like, not those signed by its
                            representative at Rio de Janeiro. Incidentally, Mr. Rodas Eguino informs
                            me that it was not the Government’s intention to say anything about the
                            Standard Oil settlement until Dr. Anze Matienzo’s return but that it was
                            felt necessary to do so since the fact that a settlement was under
                            consideration had leaked from Cabinet meetings into the press and the
                            Government thought it was essential to “give the public the true
                            facts.”</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, the press had accepted the idea of a Standard Oil settlement
                            without too much opposition and public opinion also seems to be inclined
                            in the same sense, although the picture will undoubtedly change somewhat
                            when it is found that the terms are not as favorable as the Bolivian
                            Government has irresponsibly announced. However, now that the
                            fundamental step of breaking relations with the Axis powers has been
                            taken, Bolivia can no longer hold off and present the possibility of
                            such a breach as a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> for further
                            concessions. Once Dr. Anze Matienzo and Mr. Guachalla arrive and the
                            matter is taken up in the Cabinet definitely, I believe that they, with
                            such assistance as Mr. Bohan, Mr. Mariaca, and I can offer them, will be
                            able to overcome obstacles and get the agreements approved. However, the
                            situation will not be an easy one. …</p>

                            situation through which the country is passing at present with relation
                            to problems of continental defense and its own security, have considered

                            its valued recommendation before the proper authorities in order that
                            the Bolivian request, which is given concrete form in the following
                            points, may be decided on favorably: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>That the credit of $3,000,000 established as the first quota
                                    be allotted in full for the acquisition of aviation training
                                    material.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>That the application submitted to the War Department in
                                    Washington by the Bolivian Purchasing Commission be accepted in
                                    full, in view of the fact that no substitutions can be made for
                                    the material included in the said application, because of the
                                    special flying conditions in Bolivia, due to the
                                    altitude.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>This petition is repeated, in view of the fact that the War Department at
                            Washington has placed in its specifications the supplying of certain
                            types of airplanes that could not be used in my country without serious
                            danger to the life of the Bolivian and American pilots who expect to
                            receive the training planes to open an active period of training.</p>

                        <p>The reasons forming the basis for the previous request were set forth to
                            the Hon. Sumner Welles, Under Secretary of State, and the Hon. Laurence
                            Duggan, Adviser on Political Relations of the exalted Department of
                            which you are in charge, by General David Toro, ex-President of Bolivia
                            and head of the Bolivian Military Purchasing Commission, and also by
                            Colonel Oscar Moscoso, Military and Air Attaché of this Legation, during
                            the interviews which the high officials mentioned were good enough to
                            grant us a few days ago. Further, Colonel Moscoso is sending to Mr.
                            Duggan today a Confidential Memorandum in which data on Bolivian
                            aviation are given.<note n="31" xml:id="d485fn31">Not
                            printed.</note></p>
                        <p>My Government hopes that Your Excellency’s Government will receive this
                            suggestion favorably, in view of the fact that Bolivia is the principal
                            source of supply of tin and tungsten, “strategic minerals” which the
                            United States of America, Great Britain and the other United Nations
                            need for the production of arms.</p>
                        <p>The principal mining centers in Bolivia may be subjected to surprise
                            attacks by air, which can easily be made by an enemy from airplane
                            carriers which approach the coast. Three hours of flight would be enough
                            to place the airplanes over Catavi, Oruro, Potosi and other important
                            mining centers which produce not only tin and tungsten but zinc, lead,
                            antimony, copper, etc. If the enemy should reach his objective, the
                            supplying of Bolivian minerals to the United States of America would be
                            entirely interrupted. Bolivia has no means of anti-aircraft defense, and
                            it is urgent to attend to this common danger by hastening the
                            organization of a good military aviation school.</p>
                        <p>Because of her strategic location within the geography of the continent,
                            Bolivia can, in accordance with any joint plan for defense, be
                            converted, with the aid of the United States of America, into a great
                            future air base, the position of which in the center of the Continent,
                            in the heights of the Altiplano and with easy access to the coasts,
                            would represent a factor advantageous to American aviation.</p>
                        <p>Bolivia, furthermore, an inland country with few means of communication
                            and consequently with her economic, political and social life
                            unarticulated, today faces grave problems in connection with national
                            unity, due to the lack of contacts between the various regions of her
                            territory. To augment military and civil aviation is consequently a
                            program on which action is urgently needed for any Government which
                            attempts to carry out a constructive plan for the benefit of the
                            whole.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with all the preceding, I respectfully request Your
                            Excellency to recommend to the War Department that my Governmerit’s <pb
                                n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0540"/>application be decided in
                            harmony with the urgent needs of Bolivia, whose attitude of loyal
                            friendship and frank support toward the United States of America is well
                            known to Your Excellency.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador<note n="32" xml:id="d486fn32">The Bolivian Ambassador,
                                Luis Fernando Guachalla.</note> inquired whether there was anything
                            I could tell him with regard to the desire of his Government to obtain
                            antiaircraft equipment and certain detachments of planes to protect
                            vital installations in Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that a translation had been made of his note<note
                                n="33" xml:id="d486fn33">Not printed.</note> and the matter was
                            under consideration by the appropriate authorities of the Government. I
                            added that our preliminary exploration made it appear as though this
                            equipment, were it to be available, would probably have to be furnished
                            out of Bolivia’s Lend-Lease allocation. I impressed upon the Ambassador
                            that there was no assurance yet, however, that the equipment could be
                            spared owing to the extremely heavy demand for antiaircraft guns and for
                            planes of the type desired by his Government.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then stated that, under the arrangements contemplated by
                            his Government, it might not be necessary at this time to turn the
                            equipment over to Bolivia. With respect to the planes, his Government
                            was prepared to accept the assignment of these squadrons as part of the
                            United States Aviation Mission. The planes together with pilots,
                            mechanics, and any other necessary personnel, under this arrangement
                            would be stationed in Bolivia theoretically as a part of the United
                            States Aviation Mission but actually there to protect Bolivian vital
                            installations from air attack and to perform other missions important to
                            this Government. The Ambassador then explained that although it was
                            impossible so to state in the note, what his Government had in mind in
                            effect was the establishment of aviation bases in Bolivia. On account of
                            the central location of Bolivia in South America, his Government thought
                            that this Government might be very glad to station squadrons in Bolivia
                            that would be in a position to immediately proceed to any neighboring
                            country for whatever purpose, at a moment’s notice, thereby saving what
                            might be very valuable time.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that his Government was prepared to agree to
                            similar arrangements in connection with the antiaircraft guns, <pb
                                n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0541"/>namely, that United States
                            detachments accompany these guns and set them up and man them.</p>
                        <p>With respect both to the planes and guns, a later determination could be
                            arrived at by the two Governments as to whether they would be turned
                            over to Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>In concluding, the Ambassador referred to the interest in this general
                            question shown by the President when he received Señor Guachalla as
                            Ambassador. Señor Guachalla said that the President himself asked the
                            Ambassador what Bolivia was doing to protect its tin mines. The
                            President emphasized that it was vital to the successful prosecution of
                            the war that nothing happen to these mines.</p>
                        <p>I thanked the Ambassador for his courtesy in amplifying orally the intent
                            and purpose of his note. I told him that his views would immediately be
                            brought to the attention of the Acting Secretary of this Department and
                            appropriate high officials in the other Departments.</p>

                            telegram he is sending Guachalla based on pessimistic reports from Toro
                            to the Minister of Defense<note n="35" xml:id="d487fn35">Gen. Miguel
                                Candia.</note> that lend-lease equipment for Bolivia will be held
                            down in amount and delayed in delivery. The Minister pictures anarchy in
                            Bolivia if full lend-lease requests are not met.</p>
                        <p>While the telegram is special pleading and grossly exaggerated I do
                            believe it would be advisable to deliver 8 or 10 airplanes to Bolivia
                            well before August 6 when Congress next meets for domestic political
                            effect as well as some dual purpose machine guns for mounting on trucks
                            ordered by Bolivian Army which have received export clearance.
                            Expediting shipment of trucks would also be helpful.</p>
                        <p>Toro and Guachalla also complain about failure to appoint military
                            instruction mission to replace expelled Italian mission. If at all
                            possible rapid assignment of at least part of mission would be advisable
                            as staff schools are disrupted and we should quickly counteract Italian
                            influence on officers.</p>
                        <p>Toro also complained about treatment Bolivian Army pilots are receiving
                            in the United States. I outlined situation and suggested that attempts
                            be made through Bolivian Embassy in Washington to make them learn
                            English so that they would be eligible for Army training.</p>

                        <p>I explained to Foreign Minister as I have before to the Minister of
                            Defense that lend-lease shipments must necessarily be subordinated to
                            our own war necessities and that I was sure everything possible was
                            being done to fill Bolivian needs but that they should understand
                            delay.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my telegram
                            No. 270 of April 24, 5 p.m., with regard to an interview with the
                            Bolivian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Eduardo Anze Matienzo, in
                            which he made certain complaints concerning the Bolivian Government’s
                            dissatisfaction, based on reports of General David Toro, Chief of the
                            Bolivian Military Mission to the United States, with the progress of
                            arrangements for Lend-Lease aid to Bolivia and other matters involving
                            military cooperation. These complaints were outlined in a telegram to
                            the Bolivian Embassy in Washington with instructions for them to be
                            taken up with the Department.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister appeared particularly perturbed over a statement
                            from General Toro that the amount of aviation equipment to be turned
                            over to Bolivia under Lend-Lease has been cut from a value of $3,000,000
                            to one of $1,000,000 and that only some 36 planes will be covered by
                            this latter sum. He stated that what Bolivia needed was airplanes and
                            anti-aircraft artillery and that this news was most disappointing. He
                            also referred to a commitment which he said had been made to him by the
                            Under-Secretary at the Rio de Janeiro Consultative Meeting to the effect
                            that all that Bolivia needed for protection of its mines would be made
                            available to it and that this would be done at the expense of the United
                            States, not under Lend-Lease. The Minister said that this alleged
                            commitment covered the anti-aircraft artillery his Government wanted but
                            that General Toro had advised him that the United States Army
                            authorities with whom he was dealing had insisted it would have to come
                            out of Lend-Lease, that delivery would be much delayed and that they
                            were not prepared to agree to turning over as much of such material as
                            was essential.</p>
                        <p>While the Legation is not informed of the nature of the conversations on
                            the subject between Mr. Welles and Dr. Anze Matienzo at Rio de Janeiro,
                            it seems possible that the latter misunderstood the tenor of the Under
                            Secretary’s remarks. It would be of assistance in overcoming the
                            somewhat unreasonable attitude of the Bolivian <pb n="531"
                                xml:id="pg_531" facs="0543"/>authorities if the Legation could be
                            advised what commitment, if any, was made. It would also be appreciated
                            if the Legation could be informed as to the nature of the cut from
                            $3,000,000 to $1,000,000 mentioned by the Foreign Minister. As the
                            Lend-Lease agreement of December 6, 1941, called for deliveries of not
                            more than $3,000,000 in the first year, to cover all matériel, it occurs
                            to the Legation that what may have happened is that the Army has
                            informed General Toro that not more than $1,000,000 worth can be
                            supplied.</p>
                        <p>This morning, the Assistant Military Attaché of the Legation called on
                            the Minister of Defense, General Miguel Candia, and was met with
                            complaints similar in nature to those by the Foreign Minister to me. On
                            the subject of planes, the General insisted that it was necessary that
                            all of the 36 planes now promised should be delivered in Bolivia by some
                            time in July so that he could have them all in the air for a monster
                            parade and review he is planning for August 6, 1942, the Bolivian
                            national holiday. He also insisted on the need for additional aviation
                            equipment up to a value of $3,000,000 at a later date. How the 36 planes
                            would be gotten to Bolivia in view of the shipping shortage or how they
                            would be flown on August 6th when Bolivia does not have 36 properly
                            trained military pilots was not touched on by the General.</p>
                        <p>The General also discussed the Bolivian Army’s alleged need for
                            anti-aircraft artillery although he did not mention the supposed
                            commitment made at Rio de Janeiro for this to be paid for entirely by
                            the United States. This idea of anti-aircraft defense is an <hi
                                rend="italic">idée fixe</hi> with the Bolivian military authorities
                            who pretend to envision attacks from Japanese carriers on Bolivia’s
                            mines. Actually, of course, the worst vulnerability of these is to
                            sabotage, to guard against which the Bolivian Government has taken few
                            measures. …</p>
                        <p>In the conversation between General Candia and the Assistant Military
                            Attaché this morning, the latter made reference to a telegram he had
                            just received from the War Department to the effect that the members of
                            the Military Instruction Mission had been chosen and would be ready for
                            departure for Bolivia as soon as the contract for their services was
                            signed. To this the General replied that the present military school
                            year was far advanced and that he consequently did not want the Military
                            Instruction Mission until the beginning of the next school year, in
                            February 1943. The Department will note that this stand is completely at
                            variance with the complaints of General Toro and the Foreign Minister
                            and their insistence that the Mission be sent at once. This lack of
                            coordination in the Bolivian Government is not unusual.</p>
                        <p>It has just been learned reliably by the Legation from a confidant of the
                            Minister of Defense that an offer has been received by the Bolivian
                            Government from Argentine sources for the purchase of the old <pb
                                n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0544"/>Junkers equipment now in the
                            hands of the Bolivian Army. This equipment consists of two JU–86’s, one
                            equipped as a transport and the other as a bomber but convertible easily
                            into a cargo carrier, plus the remnants of two or three Junkers which
                            have been in accidents but something from which could be salvaged. The
                            Argentine offer is said to have stated that the planes would be used in
                            Bolivia. If this provision were serious, the only answer which occurs to
                            the Legation is that the Argentine interests have plans for starting
                            some sort of an air line in lowland eastern Bolivia (the JU–86’s are not
                            adapted to altitude flight such as would be necessary for use on the
                            plateau) possibly in part to carry the rubber they are trying to
                            contract in competition with the Rubber Reserve Company. In any event,
                            the opening of a new air line in eastern Bolivia would be in direct
                            competition with Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano in which the United States has a
                            direct interest since the line has been rehabilitated with funds
                            furnished by the Defense Supplies Corporation and is managed by Pan
                            American-Grace Airways.<note n="36" xml:id="d488fn36">For correspondence

                        <p>It occurs to the Legation that, in view of the Argentine offer, it might
                            be advisable, before turning over to Bolivia any Lend-Lease matériel, to
                            consider asking for a commitment that neither this nor any other
                            Bolivian military equipment would be disposed of to another country or
                            to foreign private interests (this latter suggestion might, however, be
                            overcome should the Bolivians desire by having any Argentine purchasers
                            organize in Bolivia as a Bolivian corporation). It will be remembered
                            that there is a provision in the L. A. B. contract whereby its Junkers
                            cannot be disposed of without consent of the Defense Supplies
                            Corporation.</p>
                        <p>The Department will recall from its instruction No. 510 of March 16,
                                1942,<note n="37" xml:id="d488fn37">Not printed.</note> to the
                            Legation that the Bolivian Government has already sold at least
                            $1,328,000 worth of rifles and rifle ammunition to the Free Belgian
                            Forces and the British Government. This was obviously in anticipation of
                            receiving Lend-Lease equipment which could replace it. It will be
                            recalled further that, under the Lend-Lease Agreement, Bolivia is to
                            receive $11,000,000 worth of matériel and repay not more than $2,000,000
                            over a period of six years. This readiness to take advantage of our
                            proposed loan leads to the belief that the Argentine offer for airplanes
                            might very easily be accepted if precautions to prevent it are not
                            taken. In any event, the Legation feels that it would not be
                            unreasonable to ask Bolivia to pay the $1,328,000 to the United States
                            on Lend-Lease as the latter equipment is delivered instead of following
                            payment schedules set forth in the Lend-Lease Agreement. <pb n="533"
                                xml:id="pg_533" facs="0545"/>Such procedure is, however, probably
                            not practicable because of the terms of the Agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Department will also recall from the Legation’s telegram No. 287 of
                            October 10, 1941,<note n="38" xml:id="d488fn38">Not printed.</note> that
                            the Bolivian Government signed a contract with one Henry Koopman, a
                            German agent who, it has been learned, was acting for Japanese
                            principals, for sale of the so-called scrap iron, held by the Bolivian
                            Army including many usable trucks. In view of the Bolivian insistence on
                            the need for trucks from Lend-Lease funds (see paragraph 2A of my
                            telegram No. 43 of January 28, 6 p.m.<note n="38" xml:id="d488fn40">Not
                                printed.</note> and subsequent correspondence), this also does not
                            have a particularly pleasant odor. As the Department was informed (see
                            my despatch No. 1181 of October 10, 1941),<note n="38" xml:id="d488fn41"
                                >Not printed.</note> the Koopman deal was put through despite the
                            Legation’s pointing out in advance to General Candia that Koopman and
                            his associates were suspected of being German agents. …</p>

                        <p>281. Your 270, April 24, 5 p.m. The text of the contract for the Military
                            Instruction Mission is now receiving the consideration of the War
                            Department, which has selected five officers for this Mission. You will
                            be informed by cable as soon as the contract is signed and the officers
                            are ready to depart.<note n="39" xml:id="d489fn39">The contract was
                                signed on August 11, 1942; the Embassy was notified by Department’s
                                telegram No. 533, August 11 (824.20/228a).</note></p>
                        <p>The Munitions Assignments Board has approved the allotment to Bolivia of
                            15 primary, 17 basic, and 10 advanced training planes, deliveries of
                            which are scheduled to begin in July and end in October. The Bolivian
                            Embassy has submitted its Government’s request for 22 additional planes.
                            This request will be given every consideration by the Board, consistent
                            with the production and demand situation obtaining during the next 6 or
                            9 months. It is suggested that the Bolivian Government submit its
                            request again during the period of delivery of the 37 planes.</p>
                        <p>The Bolivian Government’s order of trucks is receiving the attention of
                            the Department, which will send you further information on this
                            subject.</p>

                            who will bring to Bolivia the planes to be acquired in the United
                            States. The War Department reports that it will give these pilots the
                            necessary training.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report an interview
                            this morning concerning Lend-Lease equipment for Bolivia between General
                            Miguel Candia, Bolivian Minister of National Defense, and Lieutenant
                            Colonel Donald N. Wackwitz, Chief of the United States Army Aviation
                            Mission to Bolivia, which was also attended by Colonels Coello and
                            Jordan, the two ranking officers in the Bolivian Air Corps.</p>
                        <p>General Candia had asked Colonel Wackwitz to call in regard to the
                            airplanes to be sent shortly from the United States to Bolivia under the
                            Bolivian-United States Lend-Lease agreement and to plans to be made for
                            ferrying them from the United States and using them in Bolivia. General
                            Candia had received word from General David Toro, Chief of the Bolivian
                            Military Mission to the United States, that the original quota of 59
                            planes for Bolivia in 1942 had been cut to 38 and that delivery of the
                            remaining planes would have to be postponed until 1943. This seemed to
                            disturb the General greatly and Colonel Wackwitz reports that he pounded
                            the table and said that he would not accept the reduction. Colonel
                            Wackwitz attempted to explain that the need for planes for actual war
                            purposes and training in the United States necessitated the curtailment
                            but this seemed to have little effect. Colonel Wackwitz informs me that
                            the interview terminated with General Candia saying that he would send a
                            telegram to General Toro instructing him to protest to the War
                            Department and say that Bolivia could not agree to the reduction in
                            Lend-Lease deliveries this year!</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Colonel Wackwitz has for months been trying to impress upon the Bolivian
                            Army authorities the need for providing hangar and other facilities for
                            the planes which are to come to Bolivia under Lend-Lease without any
                            visible success. That the bulk of the 38 planes the Bolivian Army is to
                            receive in 1942 will be without shelter and thus subject to rapid
                            deterioration and that the Bolivian Army does not now have sufficient
                            trained pilots to utilize satisfactorily even that number of planes does
                            not prevent General Candia from insisting on more.</p>
                        <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0547"/>
                        <p>Despite the absurdity of General Candia’s stand, it does seem worthwhile
                            for the Department and the War Department to explain patiently to
                            Ambassador Guachalla and General Toro the situation making the decrease
                            in Lend-Lease deliveries necessary.</p>

                            training airplanes arrived at La Paz December 6, one having been delayed
                            in Lima because of damage caused by motor failure on the take-off. The
                            airplane flown by Colonel Coello which was damaged at San José, Costa
                            Rica, is still being repaired there by Taca,<note n="43"

                            Coello was brought back to La Paz as a passenger. None of the pilots was
                            hurt during the trip. The pilots were met at the airport by a large and
                            festive crowd, including President Peñaranda and the Minister of
                            National Defense. I believe arrival of these airplanes will have an
                            excellent effect as a concrete example of lend-lease deliveries and
                            hemisphere defense cooperation.</p>

                        <p>I am informed that the Office of Lend Lease Administration is in the

                            to the various governments and that it is the intention at some future
                            date to submit such schedules to the various governments for <pb n="536"
                                xml:id="pg_536" facs="0548"/>their approval and for payment of the
                            sums due for articles actually delivered. Until such schedules are
                            prepared and checked, it will be impossible for my Government to
                            determine how much is owed by your Government under the terms of the
                            Lend Lease Agreement. My Government interprets Article II of the Lend
                            Lease Agreement as only requiring payment by your Government for defense
                            articles which have actually been delivered and I am informed that
                            deliveries to your Government have as yet been of small magnitude
                            compared with the amount of your Government’s check.</p>
                        <p>Until the schedules referred to above are presented to your Government
                            the Government of the United States does not consider that any amounts

                            May I suggest therefore that any payments by your Government await
                            presentation of schedules of articles delivered by my Government, and

                            entrance of the United States into the War was that, with the

                        <p>There has been for the past four weeks a marked campaign in the local
                            press to this end. The campaign has been indulged in not only by the
                            ultra-nationalistic newspapers and those under some degree of German
                            influence, such as <hi rend="italic">La Galle, La Noche</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">El Diario</hi>, but also by <hi rend="italic">Ultima
                                Hora</hi>, normally entirely friendly to the United States and the
                            Allied cause. …</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">La Razón</hi>, the sole newspaper maintaining the
                            thesis that the present agreements should be honored to the letter, has
                            pointed out that a contract is a contract and that, if the War were
                            over, the United States would keep its word and continue to buy Bolivian
                            tin and tungsten at what would then be prices far higher than the
                            prevailing world ones. It has been met by its journalistic rivals with
                            hoots of derision and the claim that of course the United States would
                            not be foolish enough to do any such thing as well as the always
                            clinching argument that <hi rend="italic">La Razón</hi> has sold out to
                            foreign “imperialism”.</p>
                        <p>The newspaper campaign and analogous talk by the man in the street was to
                            be expected but it is rather disappointing that Cabinet officers have
                            taken a similar stand in conversations with me. Both the Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs, Dr. Eduardo Anze Matienzo, and the Minister of Economy,
                            Mr. Alberto Crespo … have on several occasions expressed to me the hope
                            that the Metals Reserve Company would be willing to consider an
                            “adjustment” of the tin and tungsten contracts to provide for higher
                            sales prices. They have based their arguments on slightly different
                            grounds than the newspaper campaign, alleging that costs have risen
                            greatly since the two contracts were entered into whereas the tungsten
                            contract calls for a fixed price and the tin contract practically does
                            so.</p>
                        <p>I have replied to them that it seems to me there may be some merit in
                            their argument as regards tin but that the contract covering that
                            provides for the possibility of adjusting prices in clause (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) under the heading “Price”. I have suggested
                            that the Bolivian Government, with the assistance of the principal
                            mining companies, might compile figures as to costs for submission to
                            the Metals Reserve Company as the basis for a request that the buying
                            price of tin of the Metals Reserve Company be raised. So far as I have
                            been able to ascertain, nothing has yet been done in this regard.</p>
                        <p>The Department and the Metals Reserve Company are, of course, aware that
                            one of the major reasons for increased costs of mining in Bolivia is the
                            extremely burdensome tax structure in the form of huge <pb n="538"
                                xml:id="pg_538" facs="0550"/>export and so-called additional taxes
                            as well as taxes on profits and the provision whereby mining companies
                            turn over a large share of their foreign exchange to the Government.
                            These taxes are on a sliding scale so that as prices received by the
                            companies for their minerals rise, a greater and greater share is taken
                            by the Government. If it is shown that Bolivian mining costs have risen
                            materially since the tin contract was signed, which there is reason to
                            believe is the case (wages have been increased considerably, supplies
                            and equipment from the United States are generally more expensive and
                            prices for imported foodstuffs, necessary for the functioning of the
                            mines, have risen), it is to be hoped that it will be possible to secure
                            some form of a standstill or freezing agreement from the Bolivian
                            Government covering the tax structure so as to ensure that the bulk of
                            any increase in prices will go to the companies to make up for their
                            higher costs rather than into the coffers of the Bolivian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>As regards the tungsten contract, I have taken a different stand with the
                            Bolivian authorities who have mentioned it informally to me. From
                            information from the tungsten producers themselves, it is obvious that
                            the price now being received is adequate for an excellent profit in
                            almost all cases. There is a general scurry among the larger mine owners
                            to take up options on small tungsten properties and to find new
                            opportunities for investment in the field. This would hardly be the case
                            if the price of $21 per unit contained in the present three-year
                            contract were not a fully adequate one.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, in my conversations with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs
                            and Economy and the Manager of the Banco Minero, Mr. Santiago Schulze, I
                            have pointed out (1) that the tungsten contract is a fixed price one
                            with no provisions for adjustment of the price, (2) that the price is
                            obviously a good one, (3) that the Bolivians have already received a
                            marked rise in the price in the change from a price of $17 to one of $21
                            after agreement had been reached on the first, (4) that the tungsten
                            contract is only six months old so that there has been no marked
                            increase in costs since it was signed and (5) that the Peruvian and
                            Argentine producers have recently signed contracts<note n="47"

                        <p>Interestingly enough, the press campaign for revision of the contracts
                            with the Metals Reserve Company has centered largely on the tungsten
                            rather than the tin contract. In none of it has there been the slightest
                            indication of a conception that, if the United States and <pb n="539"
                                xml:id="pg_539" facs="0551"/>Great Britain need Bolivian tin and
                            tungsten, they are the only buyers to whom Bolivia can sell nor of the
                            fact that Bolivian desire for a change in prices is futile unless the
                            Metals Reserve Company is agreeable. Furthermore, there has been no
                            consideration of the fact that were prices to be raised it would be
                            natural for the term to be made indeterminate instead of fixed, as at
                            present. … they want every advantage, both higher prices and that of
                            security in the event of an early termination of the War. I have,
                            however, pointed out to the Bolivian authorities with whom I have talked
                            that they could hardly expect to have both advantages. This plus the
                            arguments outlined in the preceding paragraph seem to have been
                            moderately effective and I have heard nothing from them as to a desire
                            for amendment of the tungsten contract for some days.</p>
                        <p>The press campaign as to revision of the tungsten contract has been based
                            on the falsest premises imaginable. Assertions have been made, for
                            example, that the United States is buying tungsten from Peru, Mexico and
                            Argentina for $30 per unit and more. These allegations having gone
                            without answer, I addressed a note to the Foreign Office on December 11,
                            1941, pointing out that the Metals Reserve Company actually had
                            contracts with Peruvian and Argentine producers at $21 per unit and that
                            we were buying from Mexican producers at the same price. The substance
                            of this was furnished to the press two days later by the Foreign Office.
                            Thereafter, the attacks on the contract mostly took another form,
                            concentrating on the idea that no contract should have been made at all
                            and that Bolivia would have been far better off to sell its tungsten on
                            the open market and take advantage of rising prices, ignoring the fact
                            that there are no rising prices, the market being controlled by the
                            United States and Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>It is of interest in this general connection, that the tungsten producers
                            themselves have had several meetings to discuss the situation and that
                            it was the general consensus of opinion among them that they did not
                            desire an increase in price but would like an extension of the term of
                            the contract at the present, or an even lower, price so as to give them
                            security for further capital investments. If the parties to a contract
                            are satisfied with it there would seem to be no valid reason for
                            objection on the part of uninvolved bystanders but logic is, of course,
                            not a factor in this situation.</p>
                        <p>The only defenses of the tungsten contract which had been published were
                            editorials and articles in <hi rend="italic">La Razón</hi> written by
                            staff members ignorant in mineral matters and two articles by Senator
                            Edmundo Vasquez, who was Minister of Economy when the tungsten contract
                            was signed; his statements were largely apologia for himself. I
                            consequently thought it advisable to get some of the facts before the
                            public and encouraged the publication of the enclosed article,<note

                            has its flaws, it was naturally written in a vein and style to make it
                            comprehensible to the average Bolivian reading it. It at least presents
                            certain facts which have not previously been aired in public. A more
                            technical or scholarly expose would have been ineffective.</p>

                            purchased by the Metals Reserve Company. If British purchasing can be
                            held off, no further definitive action will be taken until conversation
                            with Hochschild who, it is understood, arrives here 28th. Meanwhile
                            however, Office of Price Administration will call a trade meeting to
                            discuss price ceiling.</p>
                        <p>The following ideas have been advanced: (1) To drop negotiations,
                            establish ceiling prices and inform British they are free to purchase in
                            Bolivia; (2) to inform Hochschild that ceiling to be adopted will in all
                            probability be considerably less than offer made in the December 30
                            cable, but that offer still stands open for immediate acceptance; and
                            (3) to pay the prices asked by Hochschild as described in your cable of
                            December 18, 4 p.m.<note n="52" xml:id="d494fn52">Telegram No. 392, not

                            would approve this third alternative plan).</p>
                        <p>Department is anxious to come to reasonable bilateral agreement and would
                            appreciate any suggestions and advice you can offer in the premises.</p>

                        <p>31. Department’s 26, January 21, 6 p.m. Either first or second plan seems
                            satisfactory if modified by agreement with British for them to keep out
                            of Bolivian market competitively; second appears to Legation to be
                            preferable. It is obviously as much to their interest as to ours for
                            prices to be held down to a reasonable level. If Metals Reserve were the
                            only authorized purchaser for the United Nations all Bolivian antimony
                            should flow to the United States except perhaps for very small amounts
                            to Argentina and we could keep our commitments to the British by turning
                            over to them amount agreement [<hi rend="italic">agreed</hi>] upon. A
                            less satisfactory solution would be for British to establish ceiling
                            prices equivalent to ours.</p>
                        <p>Department’s desire for reasonable bilateral agreement is shared by
                            Legation but unfortunately not be [<hi rend="italic">by</hi>] Hochschild
                            or Banco Minero. Crux of matter is that antimony comes almost entirely
                            from small producers and that Hochschild and Banco Minero want to make
                            utmost possible profit as middlemen.</p>

                        <p>121. My 31, January 22, 3 p.m. Hochschild representatives and Banco
                            Minero inform me that they are willing to accept antimony price offers
                            of $1.84 to $2.21 per short unit f.o.b. Chilean ports which they say
                            Metals Reserve has made but that Bolivian Government in Cabinet session
                            2 days ago instructed Banco Minero not to accept in the hope that
                            refusal would result in Metals Reserve’s eventually agreeing to higher
                            prices originally requested by Hochschild and Banco Minero. Conversation
                            with Minister of Economy confirms this in general terms.</p>
                        <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0554"/>
                        <p>From what can be gathered here … antimony shippers are satisfied with
                            terms suggested.</p>
                        <p>I trust that Metals Reserve will be adamant in negotiations and inform
                            Bolivian Legation in Washington that antimony ceiling will be adopted if
                            negotiations are not promptly concluded. Furthermore, extending copper
                            prices agreed upon with Chile to Bolivian production should not be
                            considered in my opinion unless satisfactory antimony contract is first
                            signed.</p>
                        <p>It would be helpful if the Legation could be kept advised in general, of
                            course, of antimony negotiations instead of having to depend upon
                            partial and perhaps inaccurate reports from Bolivian sources. It may be

                        <p>242. At a meeting today the Metals Reserve Company hinted at its
                            willingness to revise the tin contract to a price of 6¢ gross, f.o.b.
                            Chilean ports. By gross is meant a Straits basis, that is, 60¢ less 1½¢.
                            Nothing definite could be said because it was not felt desirable to be
                            definite until the British had had an opportunity of presenting their
                            views on this price; and the British Embassy here is awaiting further
                            instructions from London. To our surprise, the Bolivian Ambassador
                            stated that his instructions were to stand on a 60¢ net price. The
                            meeting broke up on the understanding that the interested departments
                            and agencies would consult among themselves and reconvene the meeting in
                            the near future. It will be noted that the price which Metals Reserve
                            may be willing to pay, that is 60¢ gross, f.o.b. Chilean ports,
                            represents (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) an absolute increase in the price
                            of 10¢ per pound plus (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the shipping and
                            insurance costs from Chilean ports to Texas City and (<hi rend="italic"

                            to the Bolivian Ambassador and the producers that the contract should
                            run to December 31, 1943. Your opinion on this point is also

                        <p>286. Department’s 242, April 28, 9 p.m. Price and terms which Metals
                            Reserve hinted might be offered seem to satisfy us and we feel from
                            conversations with major producers that they would be satisfied with
                            them. Bolivian Government as usual is trying for its own purposes to get
                            maximum concessions exceeding miners’ hopes. We strongly urge Department
                            and Metals Reserve not to raise proposed offer as we think it is
                            eminently fair.</p>
                        <p>None of the Department’s telegrams contain any reference to our repeated
                            suggestions that commitments be obtained from the Bolivian Government as
                            to its taxation and exchange policies. Our support of the above price is
                            not based on any idea of generosity but on our reasoned estimate of what
                            is necessary to restore profit margin for producers and thus maintain
                            and stimulate production. If Bolivian Government cuts profits by
                            increasing tax rates or adds to costs by strengthening boliviano part of
                            these effects will be lost as was the case at the time of the tungsten
                            contract. … We trust that the Department and Metals Reserve have these
                            possibilities fully in mind and will take proper safeguards.</p>
                        <p>If effective export price ceilings are to be in effect we see no
                            objection to fixed price until December 31, 1943, although a yearly
                            price adjusted to a cost margin seems more satisfactory to us.</p>
                        <p>It is inferred from next to last paragraph of Department’s 238, April 27,
                            8 p.m.,<note n="63" xml:id="d500fn63"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref

                            adjustment is still under consideration. <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545"

                            present for this mineral. Taxes are far higher than on tin having been
                            increased at the time of tungsten contract. We feel strongly that taxes
                            should be reduced rather than price increased.</p>

                        <p>Your instructions are requested on the following question. Under a
                            contract dated November 4, 1940 Metals Reserve Company agreed to
                            purchase from certain Bolivian producers 18,000 tons of tin annually for
                            a period running five years from July 1, 1940. The price for the first
                            year ending July, 1941 was 48½ cents per pound c.i.f. United States
                            ports. Thereafter the price was to be determined by a formula which has
                            become inoperative by reason of the Japanese conquest of the Eastern
                            Straits tin producing area. Metals Reserve Company has continued to pay
                            the 48½ cents price since the formula became inoperative.</p>
                        <p>The Bolivians have asked for an increase in the price by reason of the
                            fact that the price formula has been rendered inoperative. They point to
                            increased costs both in the machinery needed for the mining operations
                            and in the general standard of living. Dawson of the Legation at La Paz
                            and the American economic mission in Bolivia advised in February that in
                            their opinion a price of 57 cents per pound c.i.f. United States ports
                            would compensate for the increase in costs since the signing of the
                            contract. This price was offered, but the Bolivians insisted on a price
                            of 60 cents <hi rend="italic">f.o.b. Chilean ports</hi>. The Bolivians
                            thus were asking for (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) an absolute increase in
                            the price from 48½ cents per pound to 60 cents per pound; (<hi

                            transportation and insurance costs from the Chilean ports to the United
                            States ports, or an estimated additional 2.35 cents per pound; (<hi

                            the risk that ships may not be available to carry the tin from West
                            coast South American ports to United States ports.</p>
                        <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0558"/>
                        <p>These demands of the Bolivians have met with serious resistance both from
                            the Metals Reserve Company and the Board of Economic Warfare. The
                            English, whom we consulted by reason of the fact that their contract
                            with the Patiño Company provided that they were obligated to pay the
                            same price as that paid by Metals Reserve Company, were also opposed to
                            the increase. Allan Dawson at La Paz, in consultation with the Bohan
                            mission, opposed the payment of this 60 cents f.o.b. Chilean ports
                            price. There seemed, however, to be important reasons for making this
                            concession. The Bolivian Ambassador made a strong case in terms of the
                            political situation in Bolivia. Furthermore, the need of this country
                            and Great Britain for tin is such that it seemed desirable to err on the
                            side of an overpayment. Accordingly, due to the insistence of the
                            Department, the Metals Reserve Company, the Board of Economic Warfare,
                            and the English agreed to the payment of the 60 cents f.o.b. Chilean
                            ports price. They even agreed to make this price retroactive to January
                            1, 1941 [<hi rend="italic">1942?</hi>]. The Department and Metals
                            Reserve also agreed, at the insistence of the Bolivian Ambassador, to
                            abandon the plan (which had previously been determined upon, with the
                            approval of Mr. Duggan) for making the tin price conditional upon the
                            reaching of a favorable agreement with Bolivia as to rubber. The only
                            demand which was made was that the contract run until December 31, 1943,
                            that is for a period of about nineteen months.</p>
                        <p>This was communicated to the Bolivian Ambassador who reported that the
                            producers felt that the contract should run for only seven months, that
                            is to December 31, 1942. His reason for this was that he felt that
                            increasing costs in Bolivia rendered it unwise to extend the contract
                            further than that date. We pointed out to him that recently the Office
                            of Price Administration has fixed ceiling prices on exports for
                            substantially all machinery and equipment and that this should prevent
                            any substantial increase in the cost of mining operations to the
                            producing miners in Bolivia. The Ambassador, however, after consultation
                            with the producers, stated that he could not accept the offer and
                            insisted that nothing less than a contract at 60 cents f.o.b. Chilean
                            ports, price retroactive to January 1, 1942, and running only to
                            December 31, 1942 would be accepted.</p>

                            between our two Governments regarding the amendatory contract<note

                                    Exteriores</hi>, No. 10, May–December, 1942, p. 99.</note>
                            entered into today by Metals Reserve Company, an agency of the
                            Government of the United States, providing, among other things, for an
                            increase in the basic price paid by that Company for tin purchased from
                            Bolivian tin producers, under the five-year contract signed on November
                            4, 1940. The increase in price is designed to compensate the producers
                            for increased costs in production and to stimulate the production of tin
                            in Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>In view of the purpose of the increase in price, I wish to confirm that
                            during the remaining life of the contract of November 4, 1940, as so
                            amended, the Bolivian Administration, in keeping with the established
                            policy of fostering the development of the mining industry of Bolivia,
                            will use its best efforts to the end that the tax and other related
                            policies of the Government of Bolivia will not be so applied as to
                            eliminate or weaken the stimulus to the production of tin which the
                            increased price under the revised contract is designed to insure, and
                            consequently that the Bolivian Administration will use its best efforts
                            to the end that the Government of Bolivia will not by such <pb n="548"
                                xml:id="pg_548" facs="0560"/>policies cause a modification under the
                            increased price of the percentages of the sales proceeds which go to the
                            Government and the tin mining industry respectively under the existing
                            price.</p>
                        <p>The amendatory contract also provides for the purchase by Metals Reserve
                            Company of the entire Bolivian production of tin ore and concentrates
                            (less the quantity thereof sold for export to buyers in the United
                            Kingdom) up to a total of 30.000 tons per year, as more fully set forth
                            in the amendatory contract. I have the honor to confirm that the
                            Government of Bolivia will adopt all measures necessary during the
                            remaining term of the contract to limit the export of tin from Bolivia
                            to the United States or to the United Kingdom except for the export of
                            not exceeding twenty-five tons of fine tin monthly to Chile and except
                            as otherwise be agreed upon between the Government of Bolivia and the
                            Government of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I am happy to assure you that the Government of Bolivia will use its best
                            efforts to cause the maximum possible production of tin to be attained
                            in Bolivia during the term of the contract and to that end, in
                            accordance with existing legislation, it will encourage the improvement
                            of wages and living conditions of the workers in the mines.</p>
                        <p>In view of the mutual economic advantages of the contract of November 4,
                            1940, as amended, I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that my
                            Government fully approves this contract and guarantees the fulfillment
                            of its terms on the part of the various Bolivian signers thereof.</p>
                        <p>Duly authorized I have added my signature to that of the producers of
                            Bolivian tin in representation of the Banco Minero de Bolivia,

                        <p>459. In view of the great difficulties encountered by you in your
                            negotiations, it is the view of the Department that you have achieved
                                <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0561"/>a major accomplishment in

                        <p>In view of the favorable outcome, the Department is prepared to obtain
                            serious and sympathetic consideration here of the revision of the
                            tungsten agreement suggested by the Minister of Economy. In substance
                            the suggested revision involves a change in price to $24 f.o.b. Chilean
                            ports and an extension of the agreement for 3 years beyond its present
                            termination. Your views on the merits of the suggested revision are
                            requested.</p>

                            telegram no. 397 of June 26, 1942, and to the Embassy’s despatch no. 41
                            of June 6,<note n="69" xml:id="d505fn69">Neither printed.</note>
                            regarding a proposed agreement with Bolivia for the purchase of cinchona
                            bark. There are enclosed two signed copies of this proposed
                                agreement.<note n="70" xml:id="d505fn70">Not printed.</note> If
                            agreeable to the Bolivian Government, please have the appropriate

                            Department.</p>
                        <p>The Department hopes that the Bolivian Government will agree to the
                            proposed agreement in its present form. A preliminary draft which was
                            presented to Señor Alberto Crespo, Bolivian Minister of National
                            Economy, on July 8 had been drawn up in the light of the Embassy’s
                            despatch under reference as well as supplementary data made available by
                            Mr. William Pennock<note n="71" xml:id="d505fn71">Drug production

                                Affairs.</note> in conversations with officials of the Department.
                            At Señor Crespo’s suggestion, Department officials discussed the draft
                            agreement in the light of changes suggested by Señor Crespo, Señor Dr.
                            Don Luis Fernando Guachalla, Bolivian Ambassador, and Señor Don René
                            Ballivian, Commercial Attaché of the Bolivian Embassy here. Señor
                            Ballivian has read the present draft and has stated he believes that it
                            embodies all of the important suggested changes, and that it is possible
                            his Government may sign it in its present form.</p>
                        <p>The principle underlying the proposed agreement is that for a three-year
                            period the United States will buy all cinchona bark and quinine products
                            produced in Bolivia, with certain exceptions, in return <pb n="550"
                                xml:id="pg_550" facs="0562"/>for Bolivian restriction on their
                            export to countries other than the United States. The Defense Supplies
                                Corporation,<note n="72" xml:id="d505fn72">An instrumentality of the
                                Reconstruction Finance Corporation operating under the Secretary of
                                Commerce.</note> or its agent, would be the sole purchaser of bark
                            and products in Bolivia. It would purchase not only for its own account,
                            but its agent would purchase also for the account of the Bolivian plant,
                            as well as for the account of those authorized to export to Argentina
                            and Chile. It is thought that the provisions of paragraph 1 (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>), regarding the requirements of the Bolivian
                            plant, and of paragraph 7 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), have met the
                            objections of the Bolivians to the provisions of earlier drafts relating
                            to the bark supply of the Bolivian plant and the legitimate
                            anti-malarial needs of neighboring countries.</p>
                        <p>Through the option granted Defense Supplies for the purchase of bark
                            containing less than two percent quinine sulphate, the United States
                            will be in a position to assist in the exploration of this undeveloped
                            part of Bolivia’s cinchona resources. This can be done through improving
                            the extraction process of the Bolivian plant enabling it to process this
                            low-content bark efficiently. The technical expert which Defense
                            Supplies promises to make available to the Bolivian plant will work on
                            this problem.</p>
                        <p>It is hoped that Bolivia will agree to the prices included in paragraphs
                            2 (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), and (<hi
                                rend="italic">c</hi>) and to the methods of payment provided in
                            paragraphs 2 and 3. In arriving at these prices, an attempt has been
                            made to set a figure for the aggregate product, in its raw and finished
                            forms, which will be of the utmost benefit to Bolivia and the United
                            States in the present emergency and at the same time does not overlook
                            the possibility that Bolivia at some undetermined future date may again
                            have to compete with the former Dutch monopoly. Furthermore, the
                            acknowledged needs of large parts of Bolivia’s population as well as of
                            our own for quinine and quinine salts have been kept uppermost in mind
                            in arriving at these suggested prices.</p>
                        <p>With these considerations in mind, the Embassy may, if necessary, urge
                            upon the Bolivian Government the advantage of judging these prices in
                            terms of the aggregate yield rather than focusing attention on one price
                            considered separately from the others. The bark price of $12.50 per
                            kilogram of sulphate content is less than the present market and,
                            considered by itself and without relation to the sulphate price in
                            paragraph 2 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) and the alkaloid prices in 2 (<hi
                                rend="italic">c</hi>), would seem to be disadvantageous to Bolivia.
                            When considered in connection with the prices for sulphate and the other
                            alkaloids, however, and particularly when it is recalled that efforts
                            will be made to expand the production and distribution of the alkaloids,
                            the bark price offered seems reasonable. In this connection, the Embassy
                            is advised that <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0563"/>the Defense
                            Supplies Corporation is purchasing 500 kilograms of the 15-percent
                            by-product mass resulting from the processing of the bark at the
                            Bolivian plant, the purpose being to make an analysis of this product
                            here.</p>
                        <p>As regards the price of $23.50 per kilogram offered for quinine sulphate,
                            it is equivalent to the United States price less an item of 13½ cents
                            added as a surcharge by the Dutch Kina Bureau. By an odd coincidence, it
                            equals what are understood to be the costs of shipping, insurance, etc.,
                            between Arica, etc., and the United States. As regards the prices
                            offered for the alkaloid by-products of the extraction process, they are
                            in the same proportion to the price obtained by the Bolivian plant as
                            the respective weights of the by-products are to the total mass.</p>
                        <p>It is not believed that the other paragraphs of the proposed agreement
                            need elaboration. The reasons for offering the services of a technician
                            to study and make recommendations for the improvement of the processing
                            at the Bolivian plant are obvious. Likewise, it is clear why the
                            services of a plant pathologist are needed and why it is believed to be
                            to the advantage of Bolivia to accept this offer. The provisions of
                            paragraph 6 for experimental plantings and for their enlargement, in
                            case they are successful, are for securing the future supply of cinchona
                            bark not only for the Bolivian plant but also for the Western Hemisphere
                            generally.</p>
                        <p>The Bolivian representatives expressed a desire for a longer term for the
                            proposed agreement than the thirty-six months provided in paragraph 11.
                            Their attention was drawn to the option which Defense Supplies would
                            have in the event that the war had not come to a conclusion at the end
                            of three years. In proposing a purchase agreement for even three years,
                            the United States is taking some risk, and by the same token Bolivia is
                            relieved of market considerations during this same period. While it is
                            not possible to state in advance that Defense Supplies would exercise
                            its option at the end of three years, the continuance of the emergency
                            war situation, which calls for the agreement in the first place, would
                            suggest the likelihood that it would do so.</p>
                        <p>Simultaneously with the despatch of this instruction, the Bolivian
                            Embassy here is transmitting a Spanish translation to its Government in
                            La Paz. The Embassy is urged to exert its best efforts without delay to
                            obtain the agreement of the Bolivian Government. Please do not fail to
                            keep the Department informed of the progress of the negotiations.</p>

                        <p>A–11. Department’s instruction no. 159 of July 24, 1942. Proposed quinine
                            agreement being presented to Bolivian Government but Embassy is of
                            opinion that prices offered are inadequate to stem reduction in
                            production and are certainly insufficient to increase production. It has
                            been noted that Department recognizes that bark price offer is less than
                            the present market (in this connection Bolivian speculators’ price,
                            presumably for delivery in Argentina, has risen to equivalent of $16)
                            but that it is felt prices for sulphate and other alkaloids, as well as
                            proposed efforts to expand production and distribution of alkaloids, are
                            sufficient compensation. This general thesis might be supportable if
                            alkaloids other than sulphate were produced by local factory and if
                            purchases of bark and of alkaloids were to be made from same persons or
                            organization; however, only alkaloid factory produces is sulphate and
                            bark dealings will be carried on through middlemen with Indian gatherers
                            while sulphate purchases will be made from factory. Sulphate prices
                            could not possibly offer inducement to gatherers and it is to be feared
                            that low bark price will result in collection of only most available and
                            highest yield bark with consequent drop rather than temporary increase
                            in production probable.</p>
                        <p>Also, present prices quoted and being received by factory are $29 per
                            kilo of quinine sulphate containing 98% quinine and $5 per kilo of
                            alkaloid mass containing about 16% quinine sulphate (in place of $3
                            price of early July as reported in Embassy’s telegram no. 524 of July 9,
                            4 p.m.<note n="74" xml:id="d506fn74">Not printed.</note>). These prices
                            are for delivery at factory and do not include packaging. Our offer of
                            $23.50 per kilo for quinine sulphate is less and even though factory’s
                            production costs would be lower on basis of suggested bark price
                            “judging prices in terms of aggregate yield” might still lead Bolivian
                            Government and factory to oppose contract unless we offer higher prices.
                            (Department will recall that large bark producers are politically more
                            potent than persons interested in factory.) In any event, some
                            bargaining will probably be necessary before agreement on terms can be
                            reached.</p>
                        <p>The annual allowance of 120 tons of bark for the factory with the
                            possibility of it being increased to 300 tons seems to the Embassy
                            rather generous. It is true that the contract draft provides for
                            purchase of alkaloids and that if operations of factory are sufficiently
                            efficient it might be preferable to purchase alkaloids in place of bark,
                            but as pointed out in Embassy despatch 41<note n="74" xml:id="d506fn76"
                                >Not printed.</note> there is at least some <pb n="553"
                                xml:id="pg_553" facs="0565"/>doubt as to the possibilities of
                            efficient operation of the factory with its present equipment and
                            personnel. The fact that no alkaloids other than sulphate are being at
                            present separated would seem to support thesis of inadequate equipment
                            and improper operation; factory states that these products can be
                            produced “only with elaborate laboratories”. Priester<note n="75"
                                xml:id="d506fn75">J. E. Priester, representative of the Dutch
                                quinine trust.</note> reports confidentially that director of Dutch
                            quinine trust while here in August 1939 to consider Government’s offer
                            to sell factory, stated it was “completely worthless”. While it has
                            undoubtedly been improved since then it is to be doubted that it now
                            represents peak in quinine production efficiency.</p>
                        <p>One possibility which may not have received consideration would be for
                            Defense Supplies Corporation to purchase from factory total alkaloid
                            mass (not sulphate) and to complete the alkaloid separation in United
                            States. Local factory’s inefficiency is most apparent in its separation
                            of sulphate and by handling this part of process in United States we
                            might be able to avoid large part of waste now being experienced and
                            still leave a place for the factory in the general scheme. Technical aid
                            would be of assistance to factory in even the mass extraction process
                            although as stated above this is most efficient part of factory’s
                            operations. It might be possible even to so improve factory that all the
                            bark might be processed here with resultant alkaloid mass being shipped
                            to United States.</p>

                        <p>536. Reference your airgram A–11 August 1, we expected that some
                            bargaining would be necessary on the proposed quinine agreement. In your
                            discretion, you are authorized to increase prices to $14 per kilogram
                            for quinine calculated as sulphate, USP X, in bark which contains 3% or
                            more of such quinine. You may then offer for bark containing less than
                            3% but containing a total of 3% or more of total crystallizable
                            alkaloids out of cinchona on the basis of the amount of such total
                            alkaloids contained in the bark as follows: 12 cents per pound for bark
                            containing from 3% to 4% of such alkaloids, 13 cents for bark containing
                            4% to 5%, 14 cents from 5% to 6%, and 15 cents for bark containing 6% or
                            more of such total alkaloids.</p>
                        <p>If these prices are not sufficient to obtain a contract, please ask
                            Bolivians to submit firm offer on entire price structure to be relayed
                            to us with your recommendations.</p>
                        <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0566"/>
                        <p>We believe prices for sulphate and alkaloid mass now offered are
                            reasonable because we plan to take entire output of factory. Our
                            reasoning is that alkaloid mass is of little value to the factory and
                            they should accept lower quinine price to dispose of alkaloid mass at
                            this good figure. Processing costs on mass are heavy but we expect to
                            reduce it to other alkaloids here.</p>
                        <p>We agree annual allowance to factory is large and can only be made
                            provided we get entire output and privilege of increasing operating
                            efficiency. We hope ultimately to have factory produce quinine sulphate
                            and totaquina under recent U.S. pharmacopoeia.</p>

                        <p>Reference is made to the note from the Bolivian Ambassador to the
                            Secretary of State dated June 29, 1942, in connection with the
                            amendatory contract entered into on that day by Metals Reserve Company
                            providing, among other things, for an increase in the basic price paid
                                <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0567"/>by that Company for tin
                            purchased from Bolivian tin producers. This will confirm that it is
                            understood between the Governments of Bolivia and of the United States
                            that, under the terms of the amendatory contract, exports of tin from
                            Bolivia will be limited to the United States or to the United Kingdom
                            except for the export of not exceeding twenty-five tons of fine tin
                            monthly to Chile and except as may otherwise be agreed upon between the
                            Governments of Bolivia and of the United States.</p>

                        <p>710. There is a growing feeling within the Department that the cinchona
                            negotiations with Bolivia are being deliberately prolonged or at the
                            best are being made the subject of a temporizing policy on Bolivia’s
                            part. The receipt of the Embassy’s telegram 831 of September 17, 11
                                a.m.<note n="79" xml:id="d511fn79">Not printed.</note> gave rise to
                            the hope that negotiations would be speeded up and that the Bolivian
                            Government would shortly give <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0568"
                            />its reactions to our proposals. The absence of any indication of
                            Bolivian desires, other than those mentioned in the Embassy’s telegram
                            under reference, tends to confirm our impression that the negotiations
                            continue to languish.</p>
                        <p>The extreme urgency of increasing our quinine supplies has been mentioned
                            from time to time and only the imperative need to develop available
                            sources of cinchona bark in the most efficient manner prompts the
                            Department to refer to it again. The high quinine content of Bolivian
                            bark, the existing extraction facilities in Bolivia, the potentialities
                            of increased extraction efficiency, and the possibilities of expanding
                            bark production through plantations all make the early conclusion of a
                            cinchona agreement with Bolivia an objective of the highest priority.
                            Equally important is the need for steps to assure the use of American
                            cinchona resources for anti-malarial needs only. We believe that the
                            proposals made to Bolivia will attain these objectives while assuring
                            Bolivia over the next 3 years favorable conditions for developing its
                            cinchona and quinine industries.</p>
                        <p>The Department urges you to consider these cinchona negotiations of the
                            highest importance. If it is not possible to receive from Minister
                            Crespo without delay a more definite expression of the form he would
                            like to see the contract take, please advise the Department immediately.
                            Would it be advisable to withdraw our proposal and request a statement
                            from Minister Crespo of the points which he should like to see covered
                            in an agreement? If it is inadvisable to withdraw the proposal, but the
                            urgency of the matter should be brought to the attention of the Bolivian
                            Government, would it be advisable to call in Ambassador Guachalla and
                            drive home the importance of the matter with him? Even after discounting
                            the effect of the existing political situation, it is still believed
                            that it is reasonable to expect a prompt reply from Minister Crespo and
                            a willingness to negotiate, which would clear up outstanding points
                            without delay.</p>
                        <p>Your comments are solicited and it is hoped that the Department may
                            receive without delay by telegraph your recommendation for pushing the
                            negotiations through to a successful and speedy conclusion.</p>

                        <p>A–108. Reference Department’s telegram No. 710, October 6, 1942, 4 p.m.
                            As indicated in the Embassy’s telegram 898, October 6, 1942, 4 <pb
                                n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0569"/>p.m.,<note n="84"
                                xml:id="d512fn84">Not printed.</note> the reluctance of the Bolivian
                            Minister of Economy to hasten the negotiation of a quinine contract has
                            been due to the very unstable political situation and the unusual
                            pressure on him and his office, since he is continuing to act
                            temporarily as Minister of Finance during the latter’s illness. In view
                            of the urgency of this matter, however, as indicated in the Department’s
                            telegram under reference, I again emphasized today to the Minister of
                            National Economy the importance which my Government attributes to the
                            conclusion of a contract which will facilitate the exportation of
                            Bolivian quinine to the United States. The Minister of Economy said that
                            he would do everything possible to give the Embassy on Wednesday,
                            October 14, the counter-proposals with respect to the provisions of the
                            proposed contract, which the Embassy has been hoping to obtain from him
                            for some time. It is understood that the principal quinine producers and
                            the quinine factory in La Paz have agreed among themselves to
                            counter-proposals which they have given to the Minister of Economy for
                            his use in presenting counter-proposals to the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Economy commented this morning that he had had an
                            opportunity to discuss the proposed quinine agreement with national
                            Deputies from the quinine producing districts, and that he had the
                            definite impression that there would probably not be much difficulty in
                            obtaining the approval of the Congress to the agreement. The Minister of
                            Economy commented further that if for any reason the agreement could not
                            be acted on by this Congress prior to termination of the present session
                            (which will probably close before the end of the year), the agreement
                            could be put immediately into effect by decree and could be presented to
                            the next Congress for approval.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the prompt purchase of available cinchona bark prior to
                            the conclusion of the agreement, it would be possible for Priester to
                            obtain a considerable quantity if he were authorized to pay the prices
                            indicated in the Embassy’s Airgram No. A–98, October 2, 1942, 4:45
                                p.m.<note n="84" xml:id="d512fn85">Not printed.</note> Priester has
                            already been able to obtain approximately 14 tons of cinchona bark

                            purchasing.</p>
                        <p>If the Department has under preparation any new or revised provisions for
                            the proposed quinine agreement which would provide for the processing of
                            all Bolivian cinchona bark in La Paz, it would be appreciated if they
                            could be sent promptly to the Embassy for consideration in the imminent
                            discussions with the Minister of Economy.</p>

                            conversations yesterday afternoon he is now dubious that any cinchona
                            bark agreement can be put through Congress this session. He expressed
                            opinion it might be much more effective for our Government to negotiate
                            individual purchase contracts with producers rather than attempt to
                            secure congressional approval of an agreement with the Bolivian
                            Government. I now believe it advisable that a purchasing agency be set
                            up immediately to negotiate individual contracts with local producers
                            before price goes higher and other complications arise. Explanatory

                            proposal and of proposed contracts with cinchona producers and with the
                            Government quinine factory.</p>
                        <p>We agree in principle to the suggestions made in your telegram under
                            reference, except point 1 as to prices.<note n="89" xml:id="d515fn89"

                        <p>The revised proposed agreement between Defense Supplies and Bolivia is
                            not greatly different, except in form, from the original proposal. Where
                            changes in substance do occur, it is felt that they are in Bolivia’s
                            favor. This is notably so in the case of prices of anti-malarial
                            products, the offer for quinine sulphate USP XII having been revised
                            upward from $23.50 to $28.34 per kilogram, f. o. b. ocean steamer
                            Arica.</p>
                        <p>For various reasons, none of the Government agencies concerned deem it
                            wise to accede to the price demands being made by Bolivian producers for
                            high-content bark. Our offers for other bark are now being analyzed.
                            While we want to increase available quinine supplies as much as
                            possible, this does not obscure the unfortunate repercussions upon our
                            over-all economic relations with Bolivia which would probably result
                            from giving in on bark prices. Moreover, to do so would necessitate
                            generalizing these concessions to other countries with whom agreements
                            have been or are being made. In this connection and for your
                            confidential information, Bolivia’s relative importance as a source of
                            cinchona bark has definitely receded as a result of information recently
                            obtained on other sources.</p>
                        <p>You are aware of our preference for an agreement with the Bolivian
                            Government rather than a number of contracts with producers and with the
                            factory. For this reason and for those sketched above, you are
                            authorized and instructed, upon receipt of the documents, (1) to
                            withdraw the original proposed cinchona agreement and (2) to replace it
                            either by the revised proposal or by the program suggested in your
                            telegram under reference, whichever appears to offer the best chance of
                            acceptance.</p>

                            with Bolivian Government to purchase entire production of rubber in
                            Bolivia except for an appropriate amount (to be agreed upon) necessary
                            for domestic consumption, at 30⅝ cents United States currency per pound

                            endorsed “on board” ocean carrying vessel at Belém and such other
                            places, as may be deemed advisable by Rubber Reserve and Bolivia and
                            subject to final price adjustment based on quality inspection and net
                            certified weights determined at port of entry in United States. The term
                            of the agreement shall be to December 31, 1946, unless sooner terminated
                            by mutual consent, price paid being subject to change after expiration
                            of first 2 years if conditions change. The Government of Bolivia would
                            agree to restrict export licenses to Rubber Reserve Company or its
                            nominees and to restrict expansion of rubber manufacturing facilities
                            and to curtail rubber manufacturing as soon as possible. The exportation
                            of manufactured rubber, if any, would be restricted to the United
                            States. Bolivia would agree to use its best efforts to cause maximum
                            amount of rubber to be produced and made available for sale to Reserve.
                            Local labor would be financed locally for necessities for collecting
                            rubber. Some governmental agency, if desirable, would be designated as
                            the single buying agency, otherwise sales would be made through usual
                            trade channels now in existence. Price on sales to Rubber Reserve would

                            low explaining they had received higher offer from Argentina without
                            specifying price. They also object to exclusive provisions stating that
                            in any event they would want to sell Santa Cruz rubber to Argentina
                            because of difficulty of communications from Santa Cruz to the Amazon.
                            (There have been no exports from Santa Cruz for last 10 years.)
                            Furthermore they indicated they would desire commitments for help
                            propriety [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] establishing plantation rubber as

                            Bolivian Government is contemplating rubber contract as a result of

                            I do not see how it can be increased much beyond 3000 tons in any
                            appreciable future because of lack of labor in rubber regions.</p>

                        <p>177. Your 193 of March 20. The following is for your information in
                            carrying on negotiations with the Bolivian officials.</p>
                        <p>As you undoubtedly perceive, it is urgently necessary that entire
                            Bolivian production of rubber be assured to us. An agreement has been
                            entered into with Brazil at a specified price and negotiations are under
                            way with the other producing countries at equivalent prices. Any
                            substantial increase to Bolivia might require changes in these other
                            prices.</p>
                        <p>The Rubber Reserve proposal involves a 5-year commitment, thus assuring
                            to Bolivia a steady demand which should be an important offset to any
                            temporarily higher offer.</p>
                        <p>Negotiations with the other producing countries are proceeding much more
                            satisfactorily, and the Bolivian position is causing unfavorable
                            reaction here.</p>
                        <p>You may use in your discussions such of the foregoing as in your judgment
                            would aid in negotiating.</p>
                        <p>Rubber Reserve Company will agree to pay premiums of 2½ cents per pound
                            for all rubber in excess of 2,500 tons and up to 4,500 tons purchased by
                            Rubber Reserve annually and of 5 cents per pound for purchases over
                            4,500, such premiums to be paid to the Bolivian Government and used for
                            expansion of production of wild rubber.</p>
                        <p>In addition Rubber Reserve would establish a fund of $1,125,000 to be
                            available for increasing wild rubber production, premiums paid as above
                            provided being credited against the funds. It is not now feasible to
                            permit the fund to be used for expansion of plantation rubber, because
                            of the complex nature of this problem and of its bearing on the post-war
                            situation. Also this is a long-range development which seems to be more
                            a subject for consideration by the Bolivian Development
                                Corporation.<note n="95" xml:id="d518fn95">For correspondence
                                concerning American aid to Bolivia involving this Corporation, see
                                    <ref target="#pg_592">pp. 592</ref> ff.</note></p>
                        <p>We understand that the Santa Cruz rubber you refer to represents only a
                            small part of the total production. While communication from Santa Cruz
                            to the Amazon may be difficult, can it be arranged at extra expense? Any
                            such expense would be a justifiable increase in price over the Brazilian
                            price. A possible method of effecting the reimbursement of this
                            additional expense might be to have the Bolivian Government pay the
                            additional costs and obtain reimbursement from Rubber Reserve.</p>

                            Offers are now 50 cents per pound or more apparently delivered in Buenos
                            Aires although this is not clear. There are at least six representatives
                            of Argentine business in La Paz trying to buy rubber or producing
                            properties. Some shipments of rubber from the Beni to Buenos Aires via
                            Manaos are already under way. Arrival of two Argentine Government

                            undoubtedly make situation still more difficult.</p>

                        <p>It is my understanding that Beni Up River Fine has always drawn a
                            substantial premium in the world markets over Number One Plantation.</p>
                        <p>I would suggest a proposition along the following lines as perhaps
                            sufficiently attractive to interest Bolivia: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Commitment of Bolivia to sell and the United States to buy all
                                    Bolivian rubber (this would hardly be accepted unless we take
                                    care of Argentina as suggested below).</p>
                                <p>Term of 5 years.</p>
                                <p>Price of 35 cents per pound for Beni Hard Cut Fine Classified at
                                    Bolivian border less actual weight deductions. Other grades to
                                    be purchased at differential identical with past trade
                                    usage.</p>
                                <p>Advance of $500,000 with promise of as much more as may be
                                    necessary for fomenting rubber conditions, organizing supplying
                                    of rubber gatherers, et cetera, to be administered through
                                    Bolivian Development Corporation or experienced special field
                                    representative of Rubber Reserve Company.</p>
                                <p>Bonus of 5 cents per pound on all rubber exports to be applied to
                                    repayment of advance. Funds from this bonus to go to the
                                    Bolivian Government after full repayment of advance.</p>
                                <p>Additional bonus of 5 cents per pound on all rubber exports if
                                    these exports exceed 1500 tons per annum, this bonus to go to
                                    producers. Publicity could be given the additional bonus so as
                                    to help rubber gatherers to get added wages.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>While I realize these are stiff terms from our point of view even they
                            will be insufficient if Argentines, as seems likely, want rubber <pb
                                n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0576"/>enough to raise ante. Is there
                            no possibility of making a deal with Argentina whereby it would withdraw
                            from [the Bolivian market?] and we would guarantee it say 50% of its
                            normal imports these to be supplied by us from Brazil, Bolivia or
                            wherever most convenient?</p>
                        <p>If something of this sort is impossible and we cannot meet Argentine
                            price it might be better to withdraw our offer, let Argentina have
                            Bolivian rubber and concentrate on Brazil. As Argentina would not offer
                            as much if we were out of the market this would at least prevent price
                            spiral in competition in Bolivia. If price is boosted materially here
                            Brazil will undoubtedly demand upward revision of our price agreement
                            with it.</p>
                        <p>As stated in my 216, March 30, 5 p.m.,<note n="98" xml:id="d519fn98">Not
                                printed.</note> premium proposals contained in Department’s 177,
                            March 28, 9 p.m., have not been presented pending further word from the
                            Department. Difficulties I see in the telegram are that (1) proposed
                            fund would apparently be advanced to Bolivian Government which could not
                            be trusted to use it properly, (2) there would thus be no direct
                            incentive to producers to increase production and (3) the
                            Argentine-Bolivian production can be increased to 2500 tons in which
                            case there would be no opportunity for repayment of fund.</p>
                        <p>A prompt decision is vital as situation is daily becoming more difficult
                            and complex.</p>

                        <p>238. Your 257 April 18. Your suggested proposal has been carefully
                            considered. Only difficulties are with respect to price and bonus
                            payments. It does not seem feasible at this time to pay more than
                            established in our agreements with Brazil and Peru. The method of taking
                            care of additional costs of production, inaccessibility of rubber
                            supplies, supplying rubber gatherers, etc. has been to make payments
                            therefor from the fund proposed to be established by Rubber Reserve
                            Company. We apparently did not make clear the nature of the fund. It is
                            not a loan repayable by the Bolivian Government, and represents merely a
                            commitment by Rubber Reserve Company to expend up to this amount for
                            increasing rubber production. There will be no obligation on Bolivia
                            with respect to its repayment; however, premiums paid are deducted from
                            the balance of the fund not theretofore expended. The figure of
                            $1,125,000 was an estimate made here of the amount which might
                            reasonably <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0577"/>be expended to
                            increase production. But, for your information only, if additional sums
                            can profitably be spent for this purpose, resulting in increased
                            production there will probably be no difficulty in making provisions for
                            them.</p>
                        <p>It is agreed that the fund might best be spent under the direction of
                            Rubber Reserve Company, or some other American governmental agency
                            operating in Bolivia, if this is acceptable to Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>In the agreement with Brazil a base price was fixed for the highest
                            grade, the agreement providing that other grades were to be at
                            appropriate differentials. A preliminary schedule fixed for this purpose
                            has now been revised after discussion with the Brazilian authorities,
                            and on the basis of the revised schedule, the price payable to Bolivia
                            for Beni Upriver Fine would be 32¼ cents per pound f.o.b. vessel at
                            Belém, Brazil and 39 cents per pound f.o.b. vessel at Belém for Beni
                            Hard Fine on washed and dried basis as stated in Department’s 205 of

                            we indicated to him the great urgency for our acquisition of the
                            Bolivian rubber production and the unfortunate political reactions here
                            if this production should go to Argentina. We said that a decision by
                            Bolivia to sell to Argentina was certain to have importance in the
                            development of economic relations between the two countries. The talk
                            then touched on the fact that discussions were going on for revision of
                            our tin and tungsten purchasing agreements with Bolivia. We threw out
                            the suggestion indirectly but sufficiently clearly that if the Bolivian
                            Government worked out the rubber production in accordance with American
                            requests, it would facilitate our endeavor to meet Bolivian requests as
                            regards tungsten and tin.<note n="3" xml:id="d520fn3">For the opinion of

                            is also agreed in principle that the excess transportation costs
                            referred to may be absorbed in some way by Rubber Reserve Company.</p>
                        <p>The fund referred to by you has been already agreed to in no. 177 of
                            March 28 and no. 238 of April 27. It is contemplated that such fund
                            would be expended under the direction of some United States governmental
                            agency, and this was stated in our 238 of April 27.</p>
                        <p>The price premiums for volume were intended to be equitably related to
                            present and potential volume of production on the same basis as in
                            Brazil. Is there any feeling that the figure of 2500 tons and 4500 tons
                            contained in 177 of March 28 are not equitable for this purpose?</p>
                        <p>While it is believed that the negotiations will be expedited through
                            conversations with Guachalla here to give him background explanations
                            which he in turn can pass on to his Government, it appears <pb n="567"

                            to accede on the major points. In view of Ambassador Boal’s imminent
                            arrival at La Paz and his first hand knowledge of the rubber situation
                            here, it is suggested that this should assist in reaching a conclusion
                            of the rubber agreement promptly and it is one of the first matters to
                            be taken up by him.</p>

                        <p>With reference to the last paragraph of Department 300, Roberts, while in
                            Riberalta conferring with rubber producers, stated that provided that
                            rubber agreement was signed, Rubber Reserve would absorb differential in
                            freight from Bolivia to Pará as compared with Acre to Pará but could not
                            cover any future increases in freight rates. His statement was based on
                            conversation with Allen in Lima and his understanding that latter had
                            received instructions authorizing this by telephone from Washington. In
                            view of this situation, believe that commitment should be made.</p>

                            <item>Because of the lack of familiarity here with the various types and
                                grades of Bolivian rubber, it is very desirable that in the
                                agreement as initially signed the price be given only for Beni Hard
                                Fine, washed and dried, and for Castilloa scrap with a provision
                                that prices for other types and grades be fixed at appropriate
                                differentials from the specified price based on past trade practice.
                                It is planned to have representatives of Rubber Reserve go to
                                Bolivia as soon as possible after the execution of the agreement,
                                and these representatives would be in a position to agree on prices
                                for these other types and grades, including the price for uncut
                                balls. Since all prices are on the basis of f. o. b. Brazilian
                                ports, it will be unnecessary to have any guarantee with respect to
                                shrinkage in transit from Brazilian <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569"

                                with rubber and they are of no value as strategic materials. The
                                same question has arisen in Brazil. It is in substance a problem
                                caused by the factors referred to in the Department’s circular

                                the amount seems unimportant one way or the other and they should
                                not be permitted to be an important issue. Under ordinary

                                and there is no disposition here to give it favorable consideration.

                            communication from the Bolivian Embassy at Buenos Aires transmitting a
                            written proposal by the Argentine Government for an agreement to buy all
                            of Bolivia’s rubber production. The proposal he said is for a term of 5
                            years. Price according to Minister of Economy is specified by the
                            Argentine Government at 39 cents for crude classified at present, f.o.b.
                            Villa Murtinho as compared with our price of 36¾ cents f.o.b. Belém.
                            Cost of transportation from Villa Murtinho to Belém is about 7
                            cents.</p>

                        <p>He said that in paragraph No. 4 of the Argentine proposal the Argentine
                            Government stated that it would be part of the agreement that it would
                            use its best efforts to maintain the present flow of sugar, wheat, rice,
                            meat, manufactured products, and hunting weapons to Bolivia and to
                            prevent any obstruction from arising in their delivery.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that the latter paragraph was considered as a
                            veiled threat that a stoppage of these necessities might occur if the
                            Argentine offer were disregarded. He said, however, that he would
                            instruct the Bolivian Embassy in Buenos Aires to advise the Argentine
                            Foreign Office that an agreement on rubber had already been reached in

                        <p>It is my feeling that economic condition of gatherers can best be
                            improved and equitable real wages established through proper control of
                            $2,125,000 fund on ground by Reserve. Greatest problem at present is
                            that gatherers are always in debt to companies which advance them food
                            and supplies. This situation can be more effectively remedied by Reserve
                            through use its fund than by Bolivian Government promises and without
                            possible bad results of insisting on latter. The Department will
                            appreciate that the fact that this article is in neither Peruvian nor
                            Brazilian agreement might open the Government here to criticism from the
                            opposition if included for Bolivia alone. Increased opposition strength
                            in the next Congress suggests advisability of not offering grounds for
                            political debate.</p>
                        <p>The President has put forward any suggestions to offer to La Paz to June
                            28 or June 29 in order to deal with rubber problem and to <pb n="572"

                            raised in my 470 and the present telegraph can be resolved before the
                            week end it should probably be possible have agreement ready for
                            signature by latter date unless new unforeseen difficulties arise.</p>

                        <p>497. For Finletter. Today I saw the Foreign Minister who returned to La
                            Paz yesterday. He explained that he has discussed the rubber contract
                            with the President and considers they are now ready to conclude but feel
                            some provision must be made to cover their situation vis-à-vis Argentina
                            which, through the Bolivian Ambassador in Buenos Aires,<note n="19"
                                xml:id="d528fn19">Adolfo Costa du Rels.</note> has made it clear
                            again that if Bolivia cuts them off without any contractor [<hi
                                rend="italic">contract</hi>] despite their offer of a 5 years’
                            contract, economic reprisals may be expected. The Foreign Minister
                            suggested that payment of 150 tons annually for “neighboring countries”
                            be made in our contract with the provision that the situation be
                            re-examined with view to adjustment by mutual consent at the end of the
                            first year.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister had at first suggested that 15% of Bolivian
                            production be set aside for export to neighboring countries but I
                            pointed out that this would unfairly [apparent omission] our cooperation
                            to increase production.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister appreciates that subtracting 150 tons annually would
                            probably mean proportionate reduction in development funds to be
                            supplied by us but says that in view of Argentine stranglehold on
                            Bolivia’s food supply and oil transportation system he considers
                            contract must include the 150 tons as a gesture. He adds that even if
                            this gesture is not satisfactory to Argentina it will place him in a
                            position to stand his ground against further intimations of unrestrained
                            pressure.</p>
                        <p>As an Argentine representative may arrive in the next few days it would
                            be most helpful to have the Department’s reply as early as <pb n="573"
                                xml:id="pg_573" facs="0585"/>possible tomorrow with a view to trying
                            to reach a conclusion before his arrival which might complicate

                        <p>Witnesseth:</p>
                        <p>1. Reserve agrees to establish or cause to be established an agency
                            (hereinafter called the “Agency”) which shall be authorized to assist in
                            developing the rubber resources of Bolivia and to acquire and sell all
                            types of rubber and rubber products produced within the territory of the
                            Republic of Bolivia. Reserve and Bolivia agree that the <pb n="577"
                                xml:id="pg_577" facs="0589"/>Agency shall have all powers necessary
                            and appropriate to the performance of these functions.</p>
                        <p>2. Bolivia recognizes the large rubber requirements of the United States
                            for the war emergency and agrees that the Agency shall have the
                            exclusive right to export rubber from the Republic of Bolivia, with the
                            exceptions provided for in Article 3 of this agreement. Bolivia agrees
                            to use its best efforts to bring about the maximum production of rubber
                            and to cause it to be sold to the Agency, and to take effective measures
                            for the purpose of conserving rubber and directing it into essential war
                            time uses, including measures to prevent the hoarding of rubber and
                            rubber products.</p>
                        <p>3. Reserve agrees that the Agency will buy and Bolivia agrees that it
                            will cause to be sold to the Agency all of the rubber, with the
                            exception of a quota for export to neighboring countries, produced
                            within the territory of the Republic of Bolivia which is not required by
                            the Republic of Bolivia for domestic use and consumption. The quota for
                            export to neighboring countries shall be 150 tons per calendar year.</p>
                        <p>Until the exact capacity and costs of production in the provinces of
                            Larecaja and Caupolicán of the department of La Paz can be established,
                            the production of these provinces exported through the city of La Paz,
                            will not be included in the present agreement, Bolivia undertaking for
                            its part to have this production included in the agreement as soon as
                            commercial and industrial conditions permit. It is further mutually
                            agreed that the exports under this provision shall not exceed 60 tons a
                            year and that in the event that production should exceed this amount,
                            the contracting parties may proceed to an adjustment of the
                            aforementioned conditions by mutual consent.</p>
                        <p>It is further mutually agreed that the rubber production from the
                            triangle formed by the rivers Tarvo and Paraguá in the Department of
                            Santa Cruz exported through Puerto Suárez will not be included in the
                            present agreement for the first year of its life, at the end of which
                            time the question of the production from this triangle will be
                            rediscussed with a view to reaching a mutual accord. It is further
                            provided that the total exports of rubber from the provinces of Larecaja
                            and Caupolicán and from the aforementioned triangle plus the above
                            mentioned quota for neighboring countries, constituting all exceptions
                            from this contract, shall not be in excess of 250 tons per annum,
                            Reserve to be entitled to and to receive all rubber produced in all
                            areas of Bolivia with the exception of said maximum of 250 tons.</p>
                        <p>Regulations for the administration of the quota for export to neighboring
                            countries shall be established by common accord between Reserve and
                            Bolivia and the figure of 150 tons shall likewise be subject to
                            adjustment by mutual consent of Reserve and Bolivia at the end of the
                            first year of the life of this agreement.</p>

                        <p>The amount required for domestic use and consumption in Bolivia shall be
                            determined by mutual agreement between Reserve and Bolivia. Should it
                            become possible, during the period of this agreement, for Bolivia to
                            establish a domestic tire factory, the quota for domestic use and
                            consumption will be subject to adjustment by mutual consent.</p>
                        <p>4. Reserve and Bolivia agree that the base price to be paid by the Agency
                            for purchases of rubber hereunder shall be forty-five (45) cents, U.S.A.

                            production and improving the quality of rubber in Bolivia, the methods
                            of producing it and the stimulation of conditions favorable to maximum
                            rubber output. The Agency will appoint an adviser designated by Bolivia
                            and satisfactory to the Agency whose duty it shall be to advise the
                            Agency upon methods of securing maximum rubber production in
                            Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>It is mutually agreed that the amount of the development fund will be
                            reduced by seventy-five thousand (75,000) dollars per annum during the
                            maintenance of the quota of 150 tons for export to neighboring countries
                            provided for in Article 3 of this agreement with the annual reduction
                            being increased or decreased five hundred (500) dollars for each ton by
                            which the export quota is augmented or cut.</p>

                        <p>8. Reserve agrees to use its best efforts so far as consistent with the
                            conduct of the war to facilitate the furnishing of necessary supplies
                            and equipment for the maintenance and expansion of the Bolivian rubber
                            industry.</p>
                        <p>9. It is mutually agreed that existing contracts for the purchase of
                            Bolivian rubber which have not been filled may be taken over by Reserve
                            with payment to be made on the terms contained in such contracts.</p>
                        <p>10. Reserve agrees to purchase during the calendar year 1942 up to five
                            hundred (500) long tons of Brazil nuts produced in Bolivia, and now
                            owned in Bolivia or Brazil by Bolivian producers at a price to be
                            mutually agreed upon by Reserve and Bolivia but in no case less than the
                            price to be paid by Reserve for Brazil nuts under similar agreements
                            with other countries, this purchase being in the nature of relief to
                            such producers during the year 1942 to facilitate readjustment of their
                            production and the labor now engaged therein with a view to utilizing
                            them in developing vegetable oil or other products, preferably
                            strategic, until such time as the world market for Brazil nuts shall
                            again be normal.</p>
                        <p>11. The term of this agreement shall be for a period beginning with the
                            date hereof and ending December 31, 1946, unless sooner terminated by
                            the mutual consent of the parties hereto.</p>

                            establishment of purchasing organization in Bolivia, we are planning to
                            buy at agreement prices from large producers through their customary New
                            York selling agents. Also during this interim it is desirable that you
                            purchase pursuant to the provisions of article 4 of the agreement all
                            miscellaneous lots of rubber which are available. For this purpose we
                            are immediately establishing a fund of $100,000 with the Bank of Bolivia
                            available to the Ambassador or his nominee. In this connection cable
                            Rubber Reserve weekly the total tons purchased with this fund together
                            with the amount of rubber stocks in each location so purchased and not
                            exported. Pending establishment official prices for grades other than
                            those specified in the agreement it is suggested that the following fob
                            ocean ports <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0593"/>prices be used:
                            Crude Beni hard fine uncut, 36⅛; Crude Bolivian hard fine cut and
                            classified, 36½; Crude Bolivian Hard Fine uncut, 35½; Crude Beni and
                            Bolivian Medium, 33½; Crude Beni and Bolivian Coarse, 26½; Crude
                            Bolivian Weak Fine cut and classified, 34⅞. Article 9 of the Rubber
                            agreement provides that Rubber Reserve may take over at the contract
                            price any pre-existing contracts for the purchase of Bolivian rubber.
                            You are requested to investigate the possibility of taking over any such
                            contracts and are authorized to take them over if possible. We call to
                            your attention that contracts providing for the exportation of rubber to
                            countries other than the United States cannot be fulfilled if the
                            exportation would be in excess of the 250 ton quota stipulated in
                            paragraph 3 for the calendar year 1942. James C. Roberts, Assistant to
                            the President, Rubber Reserve Company, expected to arrive La Paz about
                            July 21 and will be followed within 2 weeks by additional Rubber Reserve
                            personnel. Mr. Roberts will remain in Bolivia a sufficient length of
                            time to organize Rubber Reserve activities. Upon Roberts’ arrival
                            suggest he be designated Ambassador’s nominee for $100,000 fund. Worth,

                        <p>591. For Rubber Reserve from Roberts. During the last week we have
                            learned by inquiry that, prior to the signing of the Rubber Agreement,
                            the Bolivian Government had issued export permits for shipments to
                            Argentina and Chile totaling 1050 tons. Most of the holders are not
                            rubber producers but speculators who are using the permits as options.
                            As a result of this situation, the three men we have in the Beni and
                            Pando now trying to contract for rubber have <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582"
                                facs="0594"/>not been able to obtain any as the holders of the
                            permits are paying more.</p>
                        <p>This situation has been explained to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            Matienzo, Under Secretary of Economy Suaz Nabar, and Acting Minister of
                            Economy Sanjines on the basis, first, that article 3 of the agreement
                            defines that not more than 250 tons per calendar year could not [<hi
                                rend="italic">sic</hi>] be exported to countries other than the
                            United States and, therefore, that not more than <hi rend="superscript"
                                >11/24</hi>ths of this amount could go out after the signing of the
                            contract. If the permits were allowed to run, they in effect make the
                            contract ineffective as far as this calendar year is concerned as the
                            amount yet to be purchased and shipped against them will probably absorb
                            the remainder of this year’s supply. We have implied that we cannot ask
                            Washington to execute present orders for supplies for Bolivia which are
                            sorely needed in Brazil unless we are assured that the letter of the
                            agreement will be followed.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that article 9 requires that Rubber Reserve be given an
                            opportunity to buy existing contracts. We have talked with two holders
                            of permits who advise they would be glad to sell to us instead of
                            Argentina provided the Bolivian Government would give them legal basis
                            for canceling their Argentine obligations.</p>
                        <p>Sanjines agreed this morning to issue a decree to the effect that no
                            exports will be permitted unless bona fide and notarized purchase
                            contract and sales contract dated prior to the signing of the agreement
                            is presented to the Economy. As regards point 2, Sanjines agreed to
                            explore a method whereby his Government can allow these permit holders
                            to break their Argentina obligations.</p>
                        <p>It might be helpful if advantage were taken of the stay in Washington of
                            Minister of Economy Crespo and Minister of Finance Espada to impress
                            upon them the necessity of strict adherence to terms of Rubber Agreement
                            in connection with general program of economic cooperation.
                            Recommendations by them to their Government would aid us materially in
                            our efforts. This situation explains why we have not been anxious give
                            you approval to execute pending supply orders of Bolivian producers.</p>

                                printed.</note> At a meeting today with Ambassador Guachalla and
                            Minister Crespo, it was indicated that it was the view <pb n="583"
                                xml:id="pg_583" facs="0595"/>of this Government that the terms of
                            the Rubber Agreement were clear with respect to exports after the date
                            of its signature and that all that remained to be done was to implement
                            the agreement. It was pointed out that the agreement contemplated that
                            exports could be made thereafter only to United States, with the
                            exception of not exceeding 250 tons annually. It was also pointed out
                            that the agreement specifically provided that Rubber Reserve is entitled
                            to take over existing contracts and, subject to approval of Roberts,
                            Rubber Reserve desires to take over such contracts. The Ambassador and
                            the Minister were told that the situation was regarded as very serious
                            and the matter was presented to them in such a way as to leave no doubt
                            as to the possible effect on other pending negotiations of failure to
                            reach a satisfactory result.</p>
                        <p>Minister Crespo advised that he would immediately cable his Government
                            asking that the contract be implemented in accordance with its terms. It
                            is suggested that you take similar action. In this connection, it would
                            be agreeable to this Government to have 250 tons calculated on the basis
                            of a fiscal year, beginning with the date of the agreement, instead of
                            on a calendar year basis.</p>

                                Political Relations.</note> and Finletter. Reference Department’s
                            telegram No. 532, August 11 [<hi rend="italic">10</hi>], 8 p.m. The
                            Foreign Minister assured me this morning that his Government would carry
                            out the Rubber Agreement scrupulously; that no more than a proportionate
                            part of the 250 tons for this year specified in the agreement would be
                            exported for the period July 15 to December 31; that all existing
                            contracts would be called in for revision in order that Rubber Reserve
                            could take over such as they have delivered; that hoarding of rubber by
                            cloaked German interests would not be permitted and a decree
                            implementing the Rubber Agreement had been signed. This decree, I
                            gather, is the one which was drafted by the Government in consultation
                            with Roberts and is not wholly satisfactory. The Ministry for Foreign
                            Affairs confidentially ascribed the present difficulties to the
                            extensive issuance of export licenses in Crespo’s name just prior to the
                            signing of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>He read me a telegram that he had just sent to Crespo which is in the
                            sense of the above conversation as regards the Bolivian Government’s
                            intention with respect to carrying out the Rubber Agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0596"/>
                        <p>I am telegraphing separately <hi rend="italic">en clair</hi> under
                            telegram No. 632<note n="33" xml:id="d537fn33">Not printed.</note> the
                            Spanish text of the legalized copy of the decree which has been
                            transmitted to me by the Foreign Minister this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>I believe that Rubber Reserve can proceed under this decree, however, to
                            examination and acquisition of existing contracts with the Ministry of
                            Economy. As I anticipate that there will be further difficulties arising
                            out of the interests of contract holders and the large number of export
                            permits granted, I respectfully recommend that some form of contingency
                            clause be included in agreements favoring Bolivia in Washington so that
                            continuance from month to month of prices and benefits will depend upon
                            faithful execution of rubber agreement here. It is also recommended that
                            Crespo be impressed with the desirability, when he arrives here, of
                            securing the issuance of a decree in substitution of the one under
                            reference conforming to the outline satisfactorily concluded with the
                            Foreign Minister on August 8.</p>
                        <p>I gather that the Foreign Minister himself had no objection to that form
                            and that the difficulty lay rather in the Ministry of Economy. I shall
                            telegraph tomorrow whether or not the decree given in my telegram 632
                            has been published here.</p>

                            expressed its concern to the Bolivian Ambassador with respect to the
                            possibility that the rubber agreement may be subjected to modification
                            or delay in its application by reference to the Bolivian Congress. The
                            Bolivian Ambassador was informed that, while this Government did not
                            wish to presume to make suggestions concerning purely domestic Bolivian
                            procedure for endorsement of the agreement, there was no indication at
                            the time of the negotiation of the agreement that anything further than
                            the signature of the representatives of the two Governments was needed
                            to make it effective. It was emphasized to the Ambassador that this
                            Government attributes especial importance to the prompt application of
                            the rubber agreement not only as a means of obtaining a vital strategic
                            material but as an integral part of the program of cooperation with
                            Bolivia typifying the reciprocal action necessary for success of the
                            program.</p>

                                contract<note n="35" xml:id="d539fn35">Not printed.</note> which was
                            signed on October 19, 1942, between the authorized representatives in La
                            Paz of the Rubber Reserve Company and the Banco Agrícola of Bolivia
                            providing principally that the funds to be provided to rubber producers
                            in Bolivia to finance increased production will be loaned through the
                            Banco Agrícola, but that the Rubber Reserve Company shall be the sole
                            purchaser of rubber production in Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>The Banco Agrícola, according to the provisions of the contract, is to
                            receive all of the interest paid on the loans by the rubber producers,
                            in return for which the Banco Agrícola is required only to assume a
                            maximum risk of 25 percent of the loans and to perform the detailed
                            services of the collections and checking on the manner in which specific
                            amounts of funds are expended.</p>
                        <p>The Rubber Reserve Company considers this contract to be advantageous
                            principally because it includes the agreement of the Banco Agrícola that
                            the Rubber Reserve Company shall be the sole purchaser of Bolivian
                            rubber production. Also, it is definitely advantageous to the Rubber
                            Reserve Company to be relieved of the accounting details of handling the
                            large loans that are being made to producers. It is expected that these
                            loans to be handled by the Banco Agrícola may total between 50,000,000
                            Bolivianos and 100,000,000 Bolivianos (approximately between $1,000,000
                            and $2,000,000).</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the contract provides that the Rubber Reserve
                            Company shall sell to the Banco Agrícola the 250 metric tons per annum
                            that is to be available for shipment from Bolivia to countries other
                            than the United States. It is expected that the Banco Agrícola will
                            realize a comparatively large profit on this amount of rubber.</p>

                        <p>1061. The Senate today passed a resolution formulated by the Finance
                            Company and the Constitutional Committee to the effect that as the
                            Rubber Agreement is in accordance with the wishes of rubber producers it
                            need not have congressional sanction and also emitting <pb n="586"
                                xml:id="pg_586" facs="0598"/>the opinion that the operations of the
                            Banco Agrícola are administrative and do not need legal approval. “Our
                            private agreement with the Banco Agrícola is on file with Rubber
                            Reserve”.</p>
                        <p>The resolution which the Senate passed and sent forward to the President
                            seemed to imply that the Government should call in the rubber producers
                            and have them sign the approval of the agreement and the Government is
                            preparing to do this as soon as possible. Rubber Reserve representative
                            here is arranging to bring producers to La Paz for this purpose by
                            plane.</p>

                            his idea of a proper amount) and at the same time an agreement for a
                            credit of about $2,500,000 from the Export-Import Bank for oil fields
                            development and roads to petroleum region.</p>

                            a self-liquidating project and that sum suggested by Anze would be

                            resolution. I am, of course, making every effort to convince it to
                            comply with its commitment.</p>

                            whether it would be possible to use blocked sterling funds of Bolivia in
                            Great Britain arising from sales of Patiño<note n="48" xml:id="d545fn48"

                            Standard Oil.</p>
                        <p>He says that payment will be made in any case but that he desires if
                            possible to forestall criticism by pointing out use of blocked funds
                            constituted benefit to Bolivia. I have told Minister that I do not
                            consider his suggestion practicable but he has requested me to take it
                            up personally with you. Please instruct me what reply you wish made.</p>
                        <p>I see utterly no merit in suggestion for the following reasons: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Doubt as to whether British and Standard Oil would agree, and
                                    inevitable delay in making payment which would result from
                                    necessary quadripartite negotiations;</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Fact that so far as I can ascertain Bolivia does not have on
                                    hand sufficient blocked sterling to cover Standard Oil payment,
                                    having disposed of most of last year’s accumulation to
                                    neighboring countries under clearing agreements and would thus
                                    in effect be trading on futures;</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Further fact that it has large surplus of dollars
                                    available.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>If question were to be raised it should have been done at Rio de Janeiro.
                            My feeling is that if, as expected Export-Import Bank petroleum credits
                            are forthcoming before Congress meets in August, opposition which
                            Bolivian Government professes to fear will by then have become
                            unimportant and that letter suggested in my 127 is adequate support for
                            Government in the meantime.</p>
                        <p>Idea of utilizing blocked sterling funds for Standard Oil payment
                            originated in fertile mind of Finance Minister.<note n="49"

                                    can be opened. With congressional elections only a month off the
                                    story already current that the Bolivian Government is paying
                                    Standard Oil but that the promised aid from the United States
                                    Government is a fable will be spread and probably result in
                                    losses to Government in elections unless evidence to the
                                    contrary is produced. An announcement of a $2,000,000 credit
                                    would counteract this effectively, as we have said before this
                                    is really a political not an economic matter. Weak and bad as
                                    the Government is it does cooperate within limits and it is to
                                    our interest to help it unobtrusively instead of playing into
                                    the hands of the opposition which is much less friendly.</item>

                            Chief of the United States Economic Mission to Bolivia, suggesting that
                            there be established in Bolivia a managing and technical organization to
                            supervise the carrying out of the program of economic and financial
                            cooperation with Bolivia which will be formulated by the Economic
                            Mission and suggesting the general outline of such an organization.</p>
                        <p>The Department will give careful consideration to the suggestion that
                            there be established a managing and technical organization, but it is
                            believed that the advisability and nature of such an entity will depend
                            upon the nature and variety of projects eventually recommended by the
                            Economic Mission and approved by the two Governments. It is suggested
                            that the final report of the Economic Mission might include a detailed
                            recommendation on this subject. The Department agrees that it would not
                            be advisable to discuss this subject with Bolivian officials at this
                                time.<note n="60" xml:id="d549fn60">The discussion on the proposed

                            respect to the matter assure me that the necessary work will be begun in

                        <p>It is understood, in my opinion, that the fact that the amount of 25
                            million dollars is allocated for the capital of the corporation that is
                            the subject of the Agreement does not limit to that amount the
                            development program and I do not doubt that the results of the initial
                            operations of the corporation will be so satisfactory that new credit
                            contracts may be concluded with the Export-Import Bank of Washington,
                            since the idea of a plan for long-term cooperation referred to in the
                            aforesaid Memorandum of August 1, 1941 may be correctly interpreted only
                            in this manner.</p>
                        <p>It has given me very great satisfaction to enter into this first
                            Agreement with you and thus create new opportunities in the field of
                            relations between Bolivia and the United States. Consequently, I have
                            the honor to express my appreciation for the noble spirit of
                            understanding and friendship manifested by you at all times and to make
                            known to you how confident I am that, in the future, agreements of
                            greater promise will be concluded between our two countries for their

                            acknowledging receipt of your courteous letter of this date, whereby you
                            were good enough to inform me that, according to our verbal
                            understanding, the Export-Import Bank of Washington has agreed to extend
                            a credit of $5,500,000, United States currency, for the development of
                            the petroleum resources of Bolivia, in addition to the initial cost of
                            $10,000,000 mentioned in your Memorandum of January 27, 1942.</p>
                        <p>You add that the Export-Import Bank will make the necessary loan contract
                            with the Corporation referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Agreement
                            of Janury 27, 1942 as soon as the plans for the development of the
                            petroleum industry are approved by the Government of Bolivia and
                            accepted by the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                        <p>My Government attaches special importance to the Bolivian petroleum
                            industry and is certain that the initial assistance now agreed on will
                            serve as a basis for its effective development and as a source of income
                            that will permit a broad policy of credits directed toward the economic
                            reconstruction of Bolivia. With this plan in mind, my Government has
                            temporarily engaged the services of an American expert, who is now in La
                            Paz studying the reorganization of that industry in its various aspects.
                            However, in order to carry out this program completely, my Government
                            now requests the technical cooperation of the Government of the United
                            States, which it is fully confident will be extended.</p>
                        <p>In expressing to you how much I appreciate your valued influence and
                            decided support, I have [etc.]</p>

                        <p>242. Department’s 195, April 6, 5 p.m. Despite the daily promises which
                            have been made to us for 12 days that Standard Oil payment would be made
                            promptly no steps have actually been taken to this end so far as we can
                            ascertain.… We are, of course, continuing our efforts and payment may
                            possibly be effected at any time.</p>
                        <p>We respectfully suggest that (1) “stabilization” arrangement under no
                            circumstances be concluded until Standard Oil payment is actually made,
                            and (2) that it be made on no other basis than hypothecation of
                            $3,000,000 gold held by Banco Central in New York as suggested in my
                            213, March 28, 2 p.m.</p>
                        <p>It is noted from the communication from the Acting Secretary to the
                            Bolivian Ambassador quoted in the Department’s 195, that a stabilization
                            arrangement with the Banco Central and the Bolivian Government is
                            contemplated. In cases of provisions of Chase Bank loan contract of May

                            complied with we think a loan to the Government might be attacked
                            legally and feel that a loan to the Banco Central direct is preferable
                            although guarantee by Government would appear unobjectionable.</p>

                        <p>248. My 242, April 13, 6 p.m. and previous. Minister of Finance informed
                            me yesterday that Bolivian Ambassador in Washington had advised that
                            interest on proposed stabilization loan would be 1½% instead of 4% and
                            said that Banco Central would consequently use it. He has been giving
                            impression in conversations and press interviews that loan will be for
                            revolution of boliviano instead of stabilization. Any strengthening of
                            boliviano would partially nullify effects of increased tin price (see my
                            telegram 245, April 14, 4 p.m.<note n="75" xml:id="d560fn75">Not

                                n="76" xml:id="d560fn76">The Metals Reserve Co. was an
                                instrumentality of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation under the
                                Department of Commerce.</note> and Department confer as these
                            problems are intimately related.</p>
                        <p>Minister of Finance also said that he expected part of loan to be used
                            for setting up government-controlled company to carry needed mining
                            supplies. While I feel that such a company is essential, other funds
                            will be available and stabilization funds should certainly not be
                            utilized for the purpose.</p>
                        <p>My idea in recommending loan was purely as a gesture since under terms
                            suggested by me credit would only have been used if absolutely
                            economically necessary to maintain exchange position of Banco Central. I
                            hope that no definite commitment has been made on an interest rate of
                            1½% since this would be an open invitation to Bolivian Government to
                            raid Banco Central using equivalent of these funds for purposes not
                            related to currency stabilization and thus in effect increasing the
                            total foreign obligations due the United States under the program of
                            economic cooperation. If the Treasury is not committed I again urge that
                            the interest rate be made high enough and the collateral sufficiently
                            ironbound so that the loan will only be used in case of necessity and
                            for stabilization (the safe way to accomplish this is to make terms
                            severe). Otherwise it would add another burden to the future foreign
                            exchange position of Bolivia and increase the difficulties which will be
                            present in any case in the repayment of the <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601"
                                facs="0613"/>credits to which the Export-Import Bank is already
                            committed. These credits will be controlled through the Bolivian
                            Development Corporation whereas the stabilization loan if diverted will
                            be under no control whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>As I have pointed out before the operation was intended solely to assure
                            settlement of the Standard Oil question through guaranteeing exchange
                            position of Banco Central.…</p>

                            <item>Stabilization arrangements entered into by the Treasury must
                                directly involve the Government. They are in no sense loans, which
                                our Treasury is not directly empowered to make. They are rather
                                monetary arrangements in which the Treasury on request purchases
                                Bolivian currency which is held for its account by the Bolivian
                                Treasury or Central Bank, which in turn is credited with the dollar
                                equivalent at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The arrangement
                                calls for the repurchase of the bolivianos by Bolivia for dollars
                                under certain terms and conditions at the request of our Treasury.
                                Provision would be made for periodic meetings to consider the
                                boliviano—dollar exchange relationship and other relevant monetary
                                matters. They provide a basis for complete collaboration by the
                                monetary authorities of the two countries.</item>

                            <item>Since the Treasury holds bolivianos, it is not felt desirable to
                                request additional security in the form of gold. A loan against gold
                                is hardly more than a mere facility since the Federal Reserve Bank
                                or any commercial bank under appropriate conditions and with a
                                nominal rate of interest would be prepared to make such an advance.
                                The type of operation contemplated by the Treasury provides a real

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Pierre</hi>: Now that the conversations with
                            the Bolivian Ministers of Finance and National Economy are drawing to a
                            close, I am sending you for delivery to Dr. Anze Matienzo an
                            acknowledgment of his letter of July 15, 1942.<note n="79"
                                xml:id="d563fn79">Not printed.</note> I expect that by the time this
                            letter reaches you, you will have received information from the
                            Department by telegraph concerning the final results of the discussions,
                            so that the enclosed reply to the Minister of Foreign Affairs<note
                                n="79" xml:id="d563fn81">Not printed.</note> will by then be
                            appropriate.</p>
                        <p>In order to assist the two Ministers as much as possible in the
                            presentation in La Paz of the results of their discussions, we are
                            endeavoring to include in the exchange of notes at the end of the
                            discussions reference to all of the recent cooperative arrangements
                            which have been worked out both in La Paz and in Washington. I believe
                            these arrangements have been sufficient to permit an impressive
                            presentation to the Bolivian public.</p>
                        <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0615"/>
                        <p>Consistent with your suggestion, the Bolivian Ministers are being
                            informed that the Government of the United States will at the
                            appropriate time give every consideration to the practicability, under
                            conditions then existing, of extending credits (up to $15,000,000) for
                            the second stage of the long-term program recommended by the Economic
                            Mission. The Ministers are being informed, however, that before such
                            action is taken, completion of the first stage of the program should be
                            assured. The Economic Mission has estimated that the second stage of the
                            long-term program should comprise approximately $20,000,000 in
                            expenditures.</p>
                        <p>It has not been considered practical to increase at this time the
                            specific commitments of Export-Import Bank credits which were promised
                            at Rio de Janeiro,<note n="80" xml:id="d563fn80">Reference is to the
                                conversations between representatives of the United States and
                                Bolivia which took place at the time of the Third Meeting of the
                                Foreign Ministers of the American Republics at Rio de Janeiro,
                                January 15–28, 1942.</note> since the scarcity of materials
                            necessary for carrying out the developments is so serious that there is
                            little prospect of being able to obtain such materials in the
                            predictable future for projects beyond those included in the first stage
                            of the program. The developments in the first stage of the program
                            appear, in any event, to be sufficiently ample to make a very definite
                            contribution to development of the Bolivian national economy. I believe,
                            moreover, that the statements made to the two Ministers in the note
                            which the Secretary of State will address to the Minister of Finance at
                            the end of his visit in Washington will provide the Ministers with
                            adequate material for favorable publicity.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellencies</hi>: It has been deeply gratifying to
                            discuss with Your Excellencies the many aspects of economic and
                            financial cooperation between Bolivia and the United States. I believe
                            that the arrangements resulting from these discussions should be of
                            great economic benefit to our two countries, and that these measures of
                            cooperation should at the same time contribute to the strengthening of
                            inter-American solidarity.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States has given careful consideration to
                            the recommendations of the United States Economic Mission <pb n="604"
                                xml:id="pg_604" facs="0616"/>which has recently completed its
                            studies in Bolivia, and this Government now believes that the
                            recommendations of the Economic Mission comprise a practicable plan for
                            systematic specific developments in Bolivia which will result in general
                            improvement in the Bolivian national economy.</p>
                        <p>The Economic Mission has outlined a long-term program totaling
                            approximately $88,000,000 for improved communications, increased
                            production of agricultural, livestock and other basic industries, for
                            irrigation projects to contribute to these agricultural developments,
                            for the further stimulation of the mining industry, and for the further
                            development of the Bolivian petroleum industry. The Economic Mission has
                            assisted Your Excellencies in the arrangements for establishing a
                            Bolivian Development Corporation which would act as a central agency for
                            the carrying out of these developments and for the provision of expert
                            assistance in studying additional projects.</p>
                        <p>In view of the decision of the Government of the United States that the
                            recommendations of the Economic Mission constitute a practicable working
                            plan, this Government is prepared to extend promptly through the agency
                            of the Export-Import Bank of Washington the credits which were the
                            subject of conversations at Rio de Janeiro between the representatives
                            of the Governments of Bolivia and the United States. As contemplated in
                            these conversations, these credits will be extended under a loan
                            agreement to be signed between the Bolivian Government, the Bolivian
                            Development Corporation and the Export-Import Bank of Washington, as
                            soon as the Bolivian Development Corporation is legally constituted.</p>
                        <p>The first stage of the $88,000,000 long-term program recommended by the
                            Economic Mission includes developments which it is estimated will
                            involve the utilization of $26,125,000, of which $12,000,000 is allotted
                            to roads; $6,625,000 to agriculture; $5,500,000 to petroleum; $1,000,000
                            to mining; and $1,000,000 to health and sanitation. Of the funds
                            required for these developments, the credits to be extended by the
                            Export-Import Bank will comprise $15,500,000. It is understood that the
                            Bolivian Government would provide funds in the amount of $9,000,000 to
                            the Bolivian Development Corporation for the program of economic
                            development, by three annual appropriations of $3,000,000 per annum, in
                            addition to which the Bolivian Government would provide a special fund
                            of $1,500,000 for highway developments. Additional funds for the
                            $26,125,000 first stage of the program would be provided by the amount
                            of $2,125,000 established by the Rubber Reserve Corporation of the
                            Government of the United States (in accordance with the terms of the
                            agreement signed with the Bolivian Government on July 15, 1942<note

                            production in Bolivia; and by the grant of $1,000,000 made by the
                            Government of the United States through the Office of the Coordinator of
                            Inter-American Affairs for the development of health and sanitation
                            projects in Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>Of the total financial resources of $29,125,000 involved in the first
                            stage in the program, the Government of the United States would
                            accordingly provide $18,625,000 and the Government of Bolivia would
                            provide $10,500,000. The apparent margin of $3,000,000 is considered the
                            minimum amount necessary for working capital and to assure funds for the
                            systematic amortization of the obligations of the Corporation.</p>
                        <p>The recommendations of the Economic Mission with respect to the number,
                            nature and size of the projects to be included in the first stage of the
                            program were based in considerable part upon considered estimates of the
                            availability of necessary materials and supplies. The machinery,
                            materials and supplies that it would be necessary to import into Bolivia
                            to complete the projects in the first stage of the program are becoming
                            increasingly scarce, and it will of course be recognized that progress
                            in carrying out the projects will be contingent upon the availability of
                            specific materials and equipment when applications are received for
                            priorities and export licenses that may be required. The Government of
                            the United States will of course make every effort to facilitate the
                            exportation to Bolivia of such equipment and materials.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States will be glad to enter into
                            conversations with the Government of Bolivia with respect to additional
                            cooperative financing of highway work in the event it is found that the
                            $12,000,000 allotted for highway developments in the first stage of the
                            program is not sufficient to complete the projects which are approved.
                            Likewise, the Government of the United States will be glad to enter into
                            similar conversations with respect to cooperative financing of the
                            Villamontes irrigation project when plans are prepared for that project.
                            These conversations will of course be dependent upon (1) the economic
                            justification of the projects which have not as yet been thoroughly
                            studied, (2) the availability of the materials which it may be necessary
                            to import from the United States, and (3) the availability of sufficient
                            labor in Bolivia to carry out the projects without affecting mining
                            production or the completion of projects that have been previously
                            approved.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the recommendations of the Economic Mission, the
                            Government of the United States will at the appropriate time give
                            favorable consideration to the practicability, under conditions then
                            existing, of extending through the appropriate credit institution up to
                            $15,000,000 in credits for the financing of the second stage of <pb
                                n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0618"/>the long-term program, which
                            stage the Economic Mission has estimated should comprise approximately
                            $20,000,000 in expenditures. It is believed, however, that before such
                            action is taken, completion of the first stage of the program should be
                            assured.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the additional measures of cooperation between Bolivia and
                            the United States which have been arranged concurrently with the visit
                            of Your Excellencies are a further outstanding indication of the close
                            relationship that has been developed between the economies of our two
                            countries. These measures include the offer of the Treasury Department
                            of the United States to enter into a monetary stabilization arrangement
                            involving up to $2,000,000 for the stabilization of the dollar–boliviano
                            exchange relationship, and the agreement of the Export-Import Bank of
                            Washington to establish special short-term credits of up to $2,000,000
                            for the Banco Central of Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>The arrangements which have been made for the purchase from Bolivia by
                            the Rubber Reserve Corporation of the United States of all rubber
                            produced in Bolivia (with the exception of not exceeding 250 tons
                            annually) should, I believe, prove to be of great practical benefit to
                            our two countries.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, the revision of the agreement which provides for the purchase
                            by the Metals Reserve Company of the United States of a specific part of
                            Bolivian tin production<note n="82" xml:id="d564fn82">For correspondence
                                on negotiations for the purchase by the United States of Bolivian

                                ff.</note> should, I believe, contribute markedly to the attainment
                            of the mutual objectives of our two governments. I am confident that the
                            $1,300,000 so far extended in credits by the Metals Reserve Company and
                            the Export-Import Bank of Washington for the development of further
                            mineral production in Bolivia will be found of practical utility in
                            effecting increased production and recovery of those minerals.</p>
                        <p>The arrangements that are now being made for revision of the agreement by
                            which the Metals Reserve Company of the United States purchases Bolivian
                            tungsten should likewise redound to the benefit of Bolivia while
                            providing the United States with continued assurance of increasing
                            supplies of this vital strategic material.</p>
                        <p>I am firmly convinced that the independence of all of the American
                            republics depends upon the victory of the United Nations, and the
                            actions of the Bolivian Government in facilitating in every way the
                            supplying of strategic minerals and eliminating Axis activities within
                            the frontiers of Bolivia are practical and effective indications that
                            the Bolivian Government shares this view. I have been gratified by the
                            arrangements which have been made with Your Excellencies for extension
                            of control over commercial and financial operations of persons and
                            entities whose activities are inimical to the security of the <pb
                                n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0619"/>hemisphere. The cooperation of
                            Bolivia in measures of mutual security such as these has been deeply
                            encouraging to the Government of the United States in the prosecution of
                            the war.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: We have been honored to receive
                            Your Excellency’s note of today’s date, summarizing the results of our
                            discussions during the past few weeks concerning measures of economic
                            and financial cooperation between Bolivia and the United States. We
                            agree with Your Excellency that these conversations have resulted in
                            arrangements which should be of great economic benefit to our countries
                            and which at the same time contribute definitely toward the
                            strengthening of inter-American cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The recommendations of the United States Economic Mission have been
                            considered by us in their various aspects, and we agree that these
                            recommendations comprise a practicable working plan for economic
                            developments in Bolivia. We likewise agree that the establishment of a
                            Bolivian Development Corporation should provide an efficient means by
                            which these developments can be carried out. It is the intention of the
                            Bolivian Government to give every possible assistance in facilitating
                            the establishment and the operations of the Corporation.</p>
                        <p>In view of the large amounts of materials and financing that would be
                            involved in the execution of the entire long-term program recommended by
                            the Economic Mission, which totals approximately $88,000,000, the
                            recommendation of the Economic Mission that the program be carried out
                            by degrees, or in stages, appears logical, utilizing in the first stage
                            of the program $26,125,000, of which $12,000,000 will be allotted to
                            highways; $6,625,000 to agriculture; $5,500,000 to petroleum; $1,000,000
                            to mining; and $1,000,000 to health and sanitation.</p>
                        <p>As outlined in Your Excellency’s note, the Bolivian Government is
                            prepared to allot funds in the amount of $9,000,000 for the capital of
                            the Bolivian Development Corporation, such funds to be provided during
                            three consecutive years at the rate of $3,000,000 per annum. In
                            addition, the Bolivian Government is prepared to provide $1,500,000 for
                            the use of the Bolivian Development Corporation in carrying out highway
                            developments.</p>
                        <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0620"/>
                        <p>The Government of Bolivia agrees that the credit of $15,500,000 which the
                            Government of the United States has agreed to extend through the
                            Export-Import Bank of Washington for the developments in the first stage
                            of the long-term economic program should constitute an exceptionally
                            useful form of cooperation between the United States and Bolivia.
                            Likewise, the additional funds provided by agencies of the Government of
                            the United States—$2,125,000 for assistance in increasing production of
                            rubber, and the grant of $1,000,000 for health and sanitation
                            projects—will be of great assistance in these specific fields of
                            activity. The offer of the Treasury Department of the United States to
                            enter into a monetary stabilization arrangement involving up to
                            $2,000,000 for the stabilization of the dollar-boliviano exchange
                            relationship is in itself fully appreciated by our Government, but
                            because of the difference in views concerning certain provisions of the
                            proposed arrangement, this matter must be postponed for further detailed
                            consideration. The agreement of the Export-Import Bank of Washington to
                            establish special short-term credits of up to $2,000,000 for the Banco
                            Central of Bolivia, should also be a very beneficial measure of
                            financial cooperation between the United States and Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>The favorable disposition of Your Excellency’s Government to enter into
                            conversations with the Government of Bolivia with respect to additional
                            financing of highway work in the event it is found that the $12,000,000
                            allotted for highways in the first stage of the program is not
                            sufficient to complete the projects which are approved, is likewise a
                            foresighted measure of cooperation. In this respect, we have the honor
                            to inform Your Excellency that the Government of Bolivia has decided to
                            allot a special fund of $1,500,000 for highway works in order that the
                            important construction of the Sucre–Camiri highway may be carried out.
                            Likewise, the favorable disposition of the Government of the United
                            States to enter into conversations with the Government of Bolivia
                            concerning cooperative financing of the Villamontes irrigation project,
                            when the plans for that project are prepared, reveals in our judgment a
                            high spirit of collaboration on the part of Your Excellency’s Government
                            which we are pleased to recognize. These conversations, both with
                            respect to highway works and with respect to irrigation works, will
                            depend, as has been agreed, on the three requirements mentioned by Your
                            Excellency in the note to which we are pleased to reply.</p>
                        <p>Our Government is certain that the financial cooperation of the United
                            States, which Your Excellency mentioned with respect to the carrying out
                            of the second stage of the long-term program, will encounter no obstacle
                            in becoming opportunely practicable, since the Government of Bolivia is
                            expecting the best results from the plan <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609"
                                facs="0621"/>which is to be initiated and it has the fullest
                            confidence that it will be able to depend always upon the assistance of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Bolivia is of course aware of the very great need in
                            the United States for materials for the manufacture of war matériel.
                            Since the Economic Mission, however, based its decisions concerning the
                            projects to be included in the first stage of the program upon the
                            estimated availability of equipment and materials in the United States,
                            the Government of Bolivia is confident that the Government of the United
                            States will make every effort to facilitate the exportation to Bolivia
                            of the necessary equipment and materials.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Bolivia is on its part doing everything possible to
                            facilitate and increase the provision to the United States of the
                            strategic materials which are produced in Bolivia. We agree with Your
                            Excellency that the recent arrangements for the exportation of
                            practically the entire Bolivian rubber production to the United States,
                            the recent revision of the agreement concerning the sale of a large
                            proportion of Bolivian tin production to the United States, and the
                            present discussions concerning revision of the arrangements for shipment
                            of Bolivian tungsten to the United States should all constitute very
                            practical measures for implementing this policy of the Bolivian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States may be sure that it is the intention
                            of the Government of Bolivia to continue and to extend the measures of
                            control over commercial and financial operations of persons and entities
                            whose activities are inimical to the security of the hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>We are pleased to inform Your Excellency that we have discussed with the
                            President of the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council<note n="83"
                                xml:id="d565fn83">Francis White.</note> the possible inauguration of
                            discussions with a view to servicing the Bolivian dollar debt. As a
                            result of this preliminary exchange of views, we believe that it may
                            soon be possible to find a mutually acceptable basis for subsequent
                            formal discussions.</p>

                            the absence of Congressional approval. Furthermore, the Export-Import

                        <p>The Department and Rubber Reserve consider that the Rubber Agreement is

                            Should the Agreement be submitted to Congress and disapproved, the
                            entire problem would have to be reexamined.</p>
                        <p>The Department perceives no direct relationship between the Rubber
                            Agreement and the Development Corporation Agreements. However, the
                            failure of Bolivia to carry out its commitments under the Rubber
                            Agreement would necessarily have an unfavorable effect upon the entire

                        <p>It is desired that you keep the Department currently informed on all

                                    was definitely understood these points went beyond the Bank’s
                                    commitment and would not be mentioned. There is, however,
                                    nothing to prevent the Congress from authorizing the Executive
                                    to contract a general credit in excess of the $15,500,000,
                                    provided such authorization does not indicate any commitment on
                                    the part of the Bank for such additional amount.</item>

                            construed as an attempt on the part of this Government to influence the

                            Excellency that the proposed loan agreement, as prepared by the
                            Export-Import Bank of Washington, between the Bolivian Government, the
                            Export-Import Bank and the Bolivian Development Corporation had been

                            Minister of Finance of Bolivia, and Sr. Crespo Gutiérrez, Minister of
                            National Economy of Bolivia, and that the contract between the Bolivian
                            Government and the Bolivian Development Corporation had been approved by
                            the Bolivian Government in the form in which it was submitted to the
                            Export-Import Bank and that the two proposed agreements would be
                            submitted without change to the National Congress of Bolivia for the
                            necessary authorizing legislation.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to advise Your Excellency that both Houses of the
                            Bolivian Congress have passed and the President on December 3
                            promulgated a law to authorize the signing of the tri-partite loan
                            agreement between the Bolivian Government, the Export-Import Bank of
                            Washington and the Bolivian Development Corporation, and a law to
                            authorize the signing of the contract between the Bolivian Government
                            and the Bolivian Development Corporation.</p>
                        <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0626"/>
                        <p>The Government of the United States and the Export-Import Bank have
                            requested a clarification of the legislative acts with reference to
                            their effect upon the understanding reached between the Export-Import
                            Bank and the Bolivian Government as to the operations of the Bolivian
                            Development Corporation contemplated by the two agreements.</p>
                        <p>I take this opportunity to assure Your Excellency on behalf of my
                            Government that the legislative acts referred to above and as now
                            promulgated authorize the signing of the two above mentioned contracts
                            in their present form without change in any of their provisions.</p>
                        <p>I also take this opportunity to assure Your Excellency on behalf of my
                            Government that the legislative acts will not necessitate any change in
                            the operations or the method of operation of the Bolivian Development
                            Corporation as contemplated by the two said agreements. In this respect
                            my Government has authorized me to give formal assurances to your
                            Government that, so long as any portion of the credit established by the
                            Export-Import Bank remains available to the Corporation or has not been
                            repaid, the functions of the “contralor fiscal” as provided in Article 9
                            of the law authorizing the loan agreement with the Export-Import Bank of
                            Washington will be exercised exclusively by the three members of the
                            Board of Directors of the Bolivian Development Corporation nominated by
                            my Government, who in the performance of their duties shall be
                            responsible to the Government of Bolivia. In acting in their capacity of
                            “contralor fiscal” as contemplated by said legislative act, the three
                            Bolivian directors will have the responsibility and obligation of
                            examining all of the accounts of the Corporation and will prepare and
                            submit reports of the handling of the funds, the execution of the works
                            and the financial condition and administration of the Corporation to the
                            Comptroller General of the Republic for his approval. The functions of
                            such directors in their capacity as “contralor fiscal” will therefore be
                            such as will be consistent with their responsibility to my Government
                            and with the duties and powers as directors as prescribed by the charter
                            and bylaws.</p>
                        <p>Further, I have been authorized by my Government to give formal
                            assurances to your Government that the provisions of the legislative
                            acts do not stipulate nor will my Government impose any limitations upon
                            the functions, powers or duties of any of the officers or directors of
                            the Bolivian Development Corporation as set forth in its charter and
                                bylaws.<note n="94" xml:id="d571fn94">These assurances were accepted

                            Legation’s despatches Nos. 1422 and 1445 of December 12 and 15,
                                1941,<note n="95" xml:id="d572fn95">Neither printed.</note> in
                            connection with the Supreme Decrees of December 10, 11 and 12, by the
                            terms of which the funds of those German, Italian and Japanese firms
                            included in the Proclaimed and Statutory Lists for Bolivia were supposed
                            to have been frozen by the Bolivian Government and to report that lax
                            administration of the decrees has nullified almost completely their
                            expected effects.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, the interventors who were supposed to have been
                            appointed to control the operations of these firms have not been named;
                            although it was not expected, even by Bolivian Government officials,
                            that really effective control would be exercised by these interventors,
                            their appointment would have been at least an indication of an attempt
                            at proper administration of the decrees by Governmental authorities. In
                            the second place, far from effectively freezing the funds of such listed
                            firms, local banks have now been authorized by the Ministry of Finance
                            to discount notes for them and to lend them money; an example of this is
                            a note in the amount of Bs. 476,075 discounted by the Banco Central on
                            December 29 for Kyllmann Bauer y Cía.<note n="96" xml:id="d572fn96">A
                                Proclaimed List firm.</note> According to the authorization of the
                            Ministry of Finance banks may now extend loans to listed German, Italian
                            and Japanese firms as long as such loans are made “under control”; the
                            fact that there is no machinery for such “control” seems not to have
                            been considered by the Ministry.</p>
                        <p>The reason offered by the Ministry of Finance and the local banks for
                            their failure to enforce the freezing order is that many of the firms
                            whose funds are supposedly blocked are so important to the economy of
                            the country that their operations must be permitted to continue. While
                            in some few cases this may be true and a reorganization of certain firms
                            may be desirable in order to eliminate their undesirable elements and to
                            permit their continued operation, it is not believed that the Bolivian
                            Government’s failure to at least attempt an enforcement of its freezing
                            order can be excused on these grounds.</p>

                        <p>The Legation is of the opinion that … this situation can be corrected and
                            a more effective control exercised over local firms included in the
                            Proclaimed List. (Reorganization would, of course, be one of the
                            possible measures of control.) However, it is my opinion that it would
                            be desirable to delay conversations on the subject with responsible
                            officers of the Bolivian Government until after the Consultative Meeting
                            of the Foreign Ministers of the American Republics scheduled for January
                            15 in Rio de Janeiro.<note n="97" xml:id="d572fn97">For correspondence

                            ff, as is to be hoped, a concerted stand is made by the South American
                            countries, including Bolivia, against the Axis powers, it is believed
                            that effective action by the Bolivian Government against Axis firms
                            within the country can much more easily be encouraged.</p>
                        <p>It is trusted that the Department will approve my delaying action in this

                        <p>The Secretary of State refers to the Legation’s despatch no. 1575 of
                            January 15, 1942<note n="98" xml:id="d573fn98">Not printed.</note> and
                            to earlier despatches relating to the ineffectiveness of the Bolivian
                            Government’s administration of the freezing regulations. It is noted
                            that the Legation concludes that purchases of properties from persons on
                            the Proclaimed List would not furnish an adequate solution to the
                            problem of restricting the influence of the present owners without a
                            more effective blocking of the proceeds and that, consequently, it is
                            the Legation’s opinion that the best method of handling the changes in
                            ownership would be for the Bolivian Government to vest title in itself
                            of Axis-owned or controlled properties situated in Bolivia for the
                            duration of the war.</p>
                        <p>In this connection the attention of the Legation is called to Resolution
                                V<note n="99" xml:id="d573fn99">Department of State <hi
                                    rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February 7, 1942, p. 124.</note> of
                            the Third Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American
                            Republics at Rio de Janeiro in which it is recommended that all
                            transactions of whatsoever nature which are inimical to the security of
                            the Western Hemisphere be prevented. The Resolution goes on to indicate
                            possible measures to be taken in cases seriously affecting the national
                            interest. Within the United States, as the Legation has been informed
                            from time to time, action has been taken to freeze entirely the assets
                            of undesirable individuals and to prevent entirely undesirable
                            transactions, requiring individual licenses for all <pb n="617"
                                xml:id="pg_617" facs="0629"/>transactions of undesirable persons or
                            firms. In certain cases firms have been granted licenses to do business
                            subject to specific limitations and provided that full reports are filed
                            with the Treasury Department. In other cases of large entities carrying
                            out operations deemed essential or important to the economy or war
                            effort of the United States, reorganizations have been required, and in
                            some cases individuals placed in the firms by the Treasury Department.
                            In one case, as a last resort, the Government of the United States took
                            over the ownership and control of General Aniline and Film Corporation,
                            under an arrangement whereby the question of compensation was postponed
                            until such time as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate, as
                            explained in the Department’s circular telegram of February 17,
                                1942.<note n="1" xml:id="d573fn1">Not printed.</note> This action
                            was taken as a last resort because it was thought that this was the only
                            way in which the enterprise could be effectively controlled and because
                            it was thought inadvisable in the national interest to require the
                            company to cease all operations and liquidate its business.</p>

                            confidential despatches Nos. 1873, 1874, and 1909 of March 20, March 21

                            by Kyllmann, Bauer y Cía. with the cooperation of the Banco Central de
                            Bolivia, and to respectfully suggest that, as a means of convincing the
                            Banco Central of its past mistakes, banks in the United States be
                            approached, perhaps informally, with reference to the possibility of
                            their not making any more collections than necessary through the Banco
                            Central.</p>
                        <p>The Department will recall the numerous despatches which have been
                            written reporting sales of dollar exchange by the Banco Central to
                            various Proclaimed List Nationals; although this has been stopped in
                            large part… sales of Argentine peso and Peruvian sol exchange have
                            increased tremendously. (Such Argentine and Peruvian exchange is of
                            course available to Bolivia only by reason of the fact that this country
                            is receiving a large supply of free dollars from the United States in
                            return for its tin and tungsten; Bolivia’s balance of trade with both
                            Peru and Argentina is extremely unfavorable.) It is true, of course,
                            that the banks have been given carte blanche to do as they <pb n="618"

                            they decide for themselves whether or not to observe the Government’s
                            freezing decree) but it is the Banco Central more than any of the others
                            which has taken advantage of the anomalous situation to enrich its
                            coffers.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>In this connection it has occurred to the Legation that perhaps one
                            effective means which might be employed would be for American banks no
                            longer to make their collections, at least for La Paz, Cochabamba and
                            Oruro, through the Banco Central. In all of these cities the Banco
                            Mercantil has a branch and could satisfactorily handle the business; as
                            suggested in previous despatches, the manager of this bank is completely
                            friendly and cooperates in every way possible with the Legation. In all
                            the other interior cities except Sucre only the Banco Central operates
                            and in Sucre the other bank is the Banco Nacional, the manager of which
                            is Nazi in sympathy (see my despatch No. 1957 of April 10, 1942<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d574fn5">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>However, probably ninety percent of the foreign collection business is
                            done in La Paz, Cochabamba and Oruro, and unquestionably the Banco
                            Central would suffer considerably if that particular source of its
                            income were temporarily cut off. In addition to the commission which it
                            enjoys on such collections most importers purchase their foreign
                            exchange from the bank which is making the collection and this is of
                            course another source of profit which would be affected if the Banco
                            Central were to experience a sudden decrease in its foreign
                            business.</p>
                        <p>There seems to be no question that the manager of the Banco Central and
                            the Minister of Finance would quickly realize the significance of what
                            was happening. Their first reaction probably would be at the end of the
                            month, when no doubt they would deduce from a study of the bank’s report
                            that importations from the United States had suffered a sharp reduction.
                            However, after observing that during the same period of time the
                            collection business of the Banco Mercantil, and the Banco Nacional in La
                            Paz, had experienced a corresponding increase it hardly seems possible
                            that they would not be struck by the coincidence. A conversation with
                            the Legation would undoubtedly result with, it is to be trusted, a
                            satisfactory solution for both parties.</p>
                        <p>It appears to the Legation that the main advantage in taking action of
                            this kind is the unobtrusiveness with which the desired end might <pb
                                n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0631"/>be achieved. As far as anyone
                            in Bolivia except the Legation is concerned American banks, by some
                            coincidence, all would have made a purely commercial decision at more or
                            less the same time to deal with some bank in Bolivia other than the
                            Banco Central. There would have to be no publishing of names or other
                            obvious action, and there would be no necessity to tell anyone what was
                            happening; however, the Banco Central would understand.</p>
                        <p>For the Department’s information Mr. Edward G. Miller, of Assistant
                            Secretary Acheson’s office, while in La Paz a short time ago suggested
                            that perhaps the above action might be effective if the Legation
                            considered it advisable; since Mr. Miller’s departure nothing has
                            occurred to make it seem less desirable that the Banco Central be
                            brought to task for its unfriendly operations.</p>

                        <p>Repeated reports have been received by this Government from sources which
                            are thoroughly reliable which clearly indicate that the Banco Central de
                            Bolivia, wholly owned by the Bolivian Government, continues to grant
                            exchange to firms in Bolivia whose activities are inimical to the
                            security of the Western Hemisphere. The exchange granted to these firms
                            in turn is remitted to German banks in Argentina and Peru. The
                            continuance of these practices by the Banco Central, which appears to be
                            contrary to Resolution V adopted at the Third Meeting of the Ministers
                            of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics, will raise difficulties in
                            connection with the operation of the stabilization agreement about to be
                            signed between the two governments. This matter has been repeatedly
                            discussed by the representatives of the United States Embassy in La Paz

                        <p>The Department of State would appreciate assurances on the part of the
                            Government of Bolivia that the Banco Central de Bolivia will desist from
                            any further operations of the type mentioned above.</p>

                            despatches of the Legation and Embassy concerning dealings of Banco
                            Central with Axis and Proclaimed List nationals. Respectfully suggest
                            that any attempts of Banco Central or its manager to dispose of these
                            funds be subjected to closest scrutiny and that origin of currency be
                            most carefully investigated.</p>

                        <p>440. Your 507, July 6, 5 p.m. The currency problem was discussed with
                            Cuenca July 8. He insisted that he did not receive notice of the United
                            States controls over currency until June 14 after he had cabled Buenos
                            Aires for information and had himself approached the Embassy. Apparently
                            this was due to the delays inherent in notifying the Foreign Office and
                            the Minister of Finance about this Government’s controls.<note n="10"
                                xml:id="d578fn10">The Ambassador in reply to this assertion observed
                                in his telegram No. 534, July 13, noon, that the Embassy note on the
                                subject had been delivered to the Minister of Finance on May 29 and
                                that the delay was due to the failure of the Minister to advise the
                                banks (811.515/1434).</note></p>
                        <p>In light of Cuenca’s vehement insistence that he did not receive prompt
                            notice, his further statement that he suspended the purchase of dollar
                            currency immediately after he did receive notice and the small amount
                            involved, the Department feels that Treasury cannot refuse to take the
                            $15,000 which the Central Bank now holds. The Department recognizes the
                            need for bringing pressure on the Central Bank but feels that under the
                            present circumstances such pressure will have to be exerted in other
                            ways. Accordingly, Cuenca is being informed today that Treasury will
                            accept the $15,000.</p>
                        <p>The agreement to accept the $15,000 is predicated upon the assumption
                            that Bolivia has now instituted complete controls over dollar currency
                            along the lines previously suggested by the Department and will
                            effectively enforce such controls. Cuenca is apparently unaware of the
                            fact that such controls have already been instituted. Treasury is
                            handing him a memorandum outlining the types of controls which this
                            Government desires to see instituted in order that he may take
                            appropriate steps to put such controls into effect to the extent that
                            this has not already been done.</p>
                        <p>Please cable whether the Department’s assumption is correct and confirm
                            whether the Central Bank is now refusing to purchase dollars and is
                            accepting such currency on a collection basis only.</p>

                            measures instituted by the Bolivian Government for the purpose of
                            transmitting United States currency to the Treasury Department.</p>
                        <p>As stated in the Embassy’s telegram and despatch under reference, the
                            controls instituted by the Bolivian Government are believed to be
                            satisfactory and to be working effectively. However, it has occurred to
                            the Embassy that it may be of interest to the Department to know that
                            the Banco Central has the apparent intention of using the foreign dollar
                            exchange turned over to it under the control measures in its own name.
                            As will be recalled, the control measures provide that all dollar
                            currency turned over to the bank by individuals will be deposited to the
                            bank’s own account in New York, and once the funds are released by the
                            Treasury Department, the Banco Central will carry out the respective
                            liquidation with the individual who makes the deposit here. It has been
                            learned through reliable sources that the Banco Central has announced to
                            depositors that it will not return the dollars either as traveler’s
                            checks or in drafts to the original owners, but will purchase the
                            dollars at the official rate of exchange, which is 46 bolivianos to the
                            dollar. Since the street rate has risen to as high as 52 bolivianos to
                            the dollar, the benefits to the bank in securing dollar exchange at the
                            lower figure are obvious.</p>

                            commercial firms which are essential to his country’s economy, owing to
                            their predominance in the distribution of prime necessities in certain
                            outlying areas. He stated that he hoped that the conference would look
                            sympathetically upon Bolivia’s special predicament in the field of
                            economic and financial controls of politically undesirable firms.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter certain members of the United States delegation discussed the
                            situation privately with Mr. Cuenca. It was explained that this
                            Government viewed with concern the continued operation, with the consent
                            of the Bolivian Government, of dangerous organizations, such as the
                            Eisner firms and Kyllmann, Bauer. It was stated that while Bolivia’s
                            problems may be difficult because of the past <pb n="624"
                                xml:id="pg_624" facs="0636"/>importance of these firms, nonetheless
                            this appeared to be a situation which could be promptly remedied by
                            action on the part of the Bolivian Government to foster other clean
                            organizations to take over the functions of the German firms and
                            ultimately to eliminate them. Mr. Cuenca stated that he had given the
                            matter serious consideration and that although he himself is completely
                            anti-Nazi and would like to wipe out the German firms, there is neither
                            sufficient technical skill nor financial resources available in Bolivia
                            to enable the Bolivian Government to take this action on its own
                            initiative without assistance from the United States. It was explained
                            to him that this Government would be pleased to consider, with
                            representatives of the Bolivian Government, the question of financial
                            assistance and the elimination of German firms, and there was again
                            strongly emphasized the necessity of the Bolivian Government’s taking
                            strong action to this end. At one point in these conversations Mr.
                            Cuenca stated that he felt it incumbent upon him to make a general
                            reservation to any resolutions adopted at the conference calling for
                            strong controls over the Axis financial and commercial transactions
                            within the American republics, but he did not press this question
                            further and made no reservation to any of the resolutions adopted.</p>
                        <p>Upon receipt of the Embassy’s telegram no. 535 of July 13, it was decided
                            that instead of discussing the problem further with Mr. Cuenca, it would
                            be desirable to arrange for a meeting between the Ministers of Finance
                            and National Economy and Mr. Cuenca, together with certain responsible
                            officers of the Department. This meeting was held on July 16, and a copy
                            of the memorandum of conversation is transmitted herewith<note n="17"
                                xml:id="d581fn17">Not printed.</note> for the Embassy’s information.
                            It will be noted that neither the Minister of Finance nor Mr. Cuenca was
                            able to attend this meeting, but that it concluded in the determination
                            to pursue the discussions further in the effort to arrive at a concrete
                            formula for the elimination of German firms.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy will be informed of further developments in connection with
                            this matter.</p>

                            July 28, 1942 concerning the ineffectiveness of Bolivian control of

                            officers of the Department participated. It was agreed at the meeting
                            that the Bolivian Ministers of Finance and National Economy would meet
                            with the managers of certain large Bolivian commercial organizations
                            soon after the return to La Paz of the Ministers, to determine the
                            financial requirements for a program in which these Bolivian commercial
                            organizations would open branches in areas of Bolivia now served in
                            large part by commercial organizations which are included on the
                            Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked Nationals.</p>
                        <p>The Bolivian Ministers of Finance and National Economy stated that, as
                            soon as information might be available as a result of such a meeting
                            with the managers of Bolivian commercial organizations, they would
                            inform the American Embassy at La Paz so that the Embassy could inform
                            the Department of State concerning the amounts of credits which the
                            Export-Import Bank of Washington might be requested to provide for the
                            expansion of the Bolivian commercial organizations.</p>
                        <p>The Bolivian Minister of Finance also stated that he would arrange for
                            the introduction of appropriate legislation at the present session of
                            the Bolivian Congress which would provide the Bolivian Government with
                            authority to expropriate Axis property in Bolivia. The Bolivian
                            Ministers of Finance and National Economy likewise stated that, as soon
                            as the Bolivian commercial organizations should be in a position to
                            provide the necessary commercial services in the areas now served by
                            organizations on the Proclaimed List, drastic action would be taken to
                            curtail the activities of such organizations on the Proclaimed List. It
                            was mentioned that one such measure would be the refusal to such
                            organizations of exchange necessary for payments for imported
                            merchandise.</p>

                            currency in Bolivia by July 15. It will be recalled (see Embassy’s
                            despatch No. 435 of August 10, 1942<note n="22" xml:id="d583fn22">Not

                            currency.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy is now in receipt of a note from the Foreign Office stating
                            that several individuals and firms were unable to make the necessary
                            arrangements for the deposit of their currency before July 15 and are
                            asking special permission to do so now. The Foreign Office, remembering
                            the Department’s statement (see circular telegram of June 19, 11 a.m.
                                [<hi rend="italic">p. m</hi>.]<note n="22" xml:id="d583fn23">Not
                                printed.</note>) that “the Treasury is expected to refuse
                            applications for the release of currency which is not promptly forwarded
                            to the United States”, has asked that the Treasury agree to accept
                            applications for the release of at least some $5,000 in additional
                            currency which has not as yet been accepted by the Banco Central for
                            forwarding to the United States. According to the Foreign Minister, the
                            Ministry of Finance will carefully supervise this additional operation,
                            will accept currency only from firms and individuals not suspected of
                            being anti-American and not included in the black lists of the allied
                            countries, and will see that the source of the currency is established
                            beyond question.</p>
                        <p>It is respectfully recommended, in view of the small amount of dollar
                            currency which will no doubt be involved as well as the evidently
                            sincere expressions of the Ministry of Finance to do everything possible
                            to avoid accepting currency from persons or firms whose activities might
                            be considered inimical to allied interests, that the request of the
                            Foreign Office, if at all possible, be given favorable consideration.
                            The Embassy of course understands that the Treasury is still accepting
                            applications for the release of currency but sympathizes with the desire
                            of the Bolivian Government to secure a definite statement to the effect
                            that applications covering the currency which it now desires to forward
                            will not be summarily refused.</p>

                            prevent the granting of exchange to any firms, whether located within or

                        <p>A–78. Your despatch 545, August 31. It is suggested that you inform the
                            Foreign Office that the several individuals and firms who were unable to
                            deposit their currency prior to July 15 now be allowed to make such
                            deposits for forwarding to the United States on a collection basis.
                            Treasury has stated that it will not view the failure of these persons
                            and firms to make their deposits before July 15 as per se sufficient
                            grounds for denying the applications for release. Treasury, <pb n="629"
                                xml:id="pg_629" facs="0641"/>however, does not wish to authorize
                            local liquidation of the currency in view of the fact that such action
                            might establish an unwise precedent.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the suggestion that the Minister of Finance will do
                            everything possible to avoid accepting currency from undesirable persons
                            or firms, it should be noted that the acceptance of such currency for
                            forwarding to the United States on a collection basis may be advisable
                            since the currency will be effectively withdrawn from circulation and
                            can be blocked in this country for reasons other than failure to deposit
                            before July 15.</p>
                        <p>It is assumed that the foregoing will satisfy the desires of the Bolivian
                            Foreign Office. If this should not be the case, please inform the
                            Department.</p>

                        <p>The Government of the United States is again constrained to advise the
                            Government of Bolivia that thoroughly reliable sources report that the
                            foreign exchange facilities of the Banco Central de Bolivia continue to
                            remain available to firms in Bolivia whose activities are considered
                            inimical to the security of the Western Hemisphere, and that the
                            exchange obtained by such firms is currently being utilized by them to
                            effect the importation of substantial quantities of marketable
                            commodities from Argentina, Chile, and Peru. This Government regrets
                            that these transactions persist despite the provisions of Resolution V
                            of the Third Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American
                            Republics and the resolutions of the Inter-American Conference on
                            Systems of Economic and Financial Control. The continuation of such a
                            course of action on the part of the Banco Central can only be injurious
                            to hemispheric security.</p>
                        <p>His Excellency, the Ambassador of Bolivia to the United States, and His
                            Excellency, Eduardo Anze Matienzo, Minister of Foreign Relations of
                            Bolivia, have heretofore assured this Government that the Government of
                            Bolivia would take all steps necessary to prevent the Banco Central from
                            engaging in such transactions. It is hoped that henceforth the Bank will
                            not grant foreign exchange to any firm whose activities are inimical to
                            the security of the American Republics. Although some of the
                            objectionable firms to which the Banco Central sells foreign exchange
                            may be essential to the economy of Bolivia, it is submitted that the
                            aspects of hemispheric security are of such magnitude that this
                            Government continues to hope that a program <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630"
                                facs="0642"/>will be formulated under which such firms may be
                            eliminated in favor of enterprises which will bulwark, rather than
                            threaten, that security.</p>

                            measures for the control of Axis nationals, and to the Embassy’s
                            despatch No. 813 of November 5, 1942,<note n="25" xml:id="d588fn26">Not

                            October.</p>
                        <p>As will be recalled, during September and October the continued political
                            crisis prevented Government leaders from giving much attention to the
                            possibilities of creating more effective controls, in spite of the
                            interest evidenced on several occasions by Minister of Finance Dr.
                            Joaquín Espada and Minister of Economy Alberto Crespo Gutiérrez in
                            accomplishing something worthwhile along these lines. Furthermore, Dr.
                            Espada’s illness during those two months, when he spent part of the time
                            in Buenos Aires, prevented him from instituting any new policies in his
                            Ministry. Dr. Espada returned to work shortly after the middle of
                            November. During the final week of November the Cabinet resigned and
                            Congress adjourned. With the recent naming of a new Cabinet, which
                            includes both Dr. Espada and Crespo in their old posts, the political
                            crisis has been eased, and it is now expected that the Ministers may be
                            more willing to take up the problem of adopting new measures for the
                            control of Axis commercial interests through foreign exchange control
                            and the encouragement or actual setting up of nation wide competitive
                            organizations.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the Embassy has continued to rely on its own initiative in
                            order to carry on economic warfare against Axis interests in
                            Bolivia.</p>

                        <p>21. For the President. The highlights of the situation are approximately
                            as follows: Two days before my arrival in Rio de Janeiro President
                            Vargas called together his Cabinet and his highest military and naval
                            authorities and told them that he had reached the decision that, both
                            from the standpoint of the highest interests of Brazil as well as from
                            the standpoint of the commitments which Brazil had previously made,
                            Brazil must stand or fall with the United States. He stated that any
                            member of the Government who was in disagreement with this policy was at
                            liberty to resign his position. He received a unanimous vote of approval
                            though the Chief of the General Staff<note n="4" xml:id="d590fn4">Gen.
                                Pedro Góes Monteiro.</note> and the Minister of War<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d590fn5">Gen. Eurico Gaspar Dutra.</note> both of whom had
                            during the earlier months of the war been unquestionably under the
                            belief that Germany would triumph stated that Brazil’s ability to defend
                            herself was very limited and one of the chief reasons for this was the
                            fact that notwithstanding the repeated efforts which the Brazilian Army
                            had made to obtain armaments and munitions from the United States and
                            notwithstanding the repeated assurances which had been given by the
                            United States Government that such help would be forthcoming, up to the
                            present time nothing but token shipments from the United States had been
                            made. They stressed particularly the point that even the few small tanks
                            which had been sent [were] without armament and were consequently
                            practically useless. Both the Minister for War and General Góes
                            Monteiro, however, stated that in their considered opinion the policy
                            announced by President Vargas was the only correct policy for Brazil to
                            follow. (I know from outside sources that both Generals have made
                            statements to exactly the same effect to representatives of the Axis
                            Powers and to representatives of the Argentine and Chilean
                            Governments.)</p>
                        <p>In the course of his statement of policy to his Cabinet, President Vargas
                            emphasized significantly that his Government did not have to depend upon
                            the Armed Forces of the Republic for the control of subversive
                            activities, even including any attempt at a local uprising by German or
                            Italian sympathizers. He told his Cabinet that the Brazilian people were
                            100% in agreement with the policy upon which he had decided and that the
                            people themselves would be able to take care of any attempts at
                            Axis-inspired uprisings.</p>
                        <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0646"/>
                        <p>Since that moment the attitude of the Brazilian Government could not have
                            been finer nor more firm from our point of view. The Brazilian press has
                            cooperated completely in everything we have wanted and the atmosphere
                            consequently created both by the press and by open public sympathy with
                            the United States has needless to say been enormously helpful at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>President Vargas has stated to the Argentine Foreign Minister<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d590fn6">Enrique Ruiz-Guiñazú.</note> that the Brazilian
                            Government supports the United States completely and that the Brazilian
                            Government considers it indispensable that a joint declaration by all
                            the American Republics for an immediate severance of relations with the
                            Axis Powers be adopted at the Conference. He has sent a personal message
                            to that effect by courier to the Acting President of Argentina<note
                                n="7" xml:id="d590fn7">Ramón Castillo.</note> and he is presently
                            using all of Brazil’s very great influence in Chile in order to bring
                            the Chilean Government in line. It is not too much to say that had it
                            not been for the strong and helpful position taken by President Vargas
                            and by Aranha<note n="8" xml:id="d590fn8">Oswaldo Aranha, Brazilian
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> four of the other South
                            American Republics would probably have drifted in the direction of
                            Argentina.</p>
                        <p>Last night President Vargas sent for me and after I had expressed my deep
                            appreciation of all that he had been doing to cooperate with us he said
                            that as I knew the decisions of his Government had been taken and that
                            the decisions were final. He continued that as Aranha had told me
                            earlier in the evening the latter had received during the day letters
                            addressed to him on [<hi rend="italic">from</hi>] the German, Italian,
                            and Japanese Ambassadors. These letters, whose texts I had seen stated,
                            bluntly, in the case of the German Ambassador and in a more veiled
                            fashion in the case of the Japanese and Italian Ambassadors that if
                            Brazil undertook to break diplomatic relations she could anticipate a
                            state of war with the Axis Powers. (The letters were regarded as
                            personal by the Brazilian Government and they are therefore anxious that
                            no publicity should be given to their contents as yet.)</p>
                        <p>President Vargas then went on to say that the decision reached by the
                            Brazilian Government implied inevitably that she would soon be actually
                            at war. He said that the responsibility which he had assumed on behalf
                            of the Brazilian people was very great. He said that it was peculiarly
                            great because of the fact that notwithstanding all his efforts during
                            the past 18 months to obtain at least a minimum of war supplies from the
                            United States I myself knew what the result of his effort had been. He
                            said that he felt that in view of the present circumstances he could
                            depend upon you better than anyone else to understand his crucial
                            difficulties. He went on to <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0647"/>say
                            that obviously Brazil could not be treated as a small Central American
                            power which would be satisfied with the stationing of American troops
                            upon its territory, but that Brazil rather has a right to be regarded by
                            the United States as a friend and ally and as entitled to be furnished
                            under the Lend-Lease Act<note n="9" xml:id="d590fn9">Act of March 11,

                            sufficient to enable the Brazilian Army to defend at least in part those
                            regions of northeastern Brazil whose defense is as vitally necessary for
                            the United States as for Brazil herself.</p>
                        <p>In view of the nature of the conversation I regarded it as inexpedient to
                            take up with the President the issue of the stationing of United States
                            forces in northeastern Brazil in line with the understanding which I
                            reached with General Marshall before I left Washington. Personally I
                            have no doubt that this issue can be met successfully and that the
                            Brazilian Government will agree thereto provided the Brazilian Army is
                            given at least a minimum of matériel requested by President Vargas.</p>
                        <p>The conversation I had with the President was at a large gathering and I
                            could only speak with him for a few moments. He has asked me to come to
                            see him alone tomorrow, Monday, evening at 6 o’clock. I should like to
                            be specifically authorized by you to state in the course of that
                            conversation that I have communicated directly with you and that you
                            have authorized me to say to him as Chief Executive of one great
                            American nation to the Chief Executive of another great American nation
                            and also as a personal friend that if the President will give me a list
                            of the minimum requirements needed urgently by the Brazilian Army for
                            the proper protection of northeastern Brazil you will give orders that
                            the items contained in that list will be made available to the Brazilian
                            Government at the first possible moment subject only to the exigencies
                            of the present defense requirements of the United States of America and
                            to any subsequent modifications that may later be agreed upon by the
                            United States and Brazilian General Staffs.</p>
                        <p>As I know you will appreciate the issue involved is one of the highest
                            national importance.… Like all armies, the Brazilian High Command is not
                            inclined to be enthusiastic about getting into war if they have none of
                            the basic elements for defense. If they are not promptly given the
                            necessary assurances and if they are not able to see with their own eyes
                            before long some concrete evidences of help coming, exactly that kind of
                            a situation which the Nazis could use to their best advantage will be
                            created.</p>

                        <p>The problem is one of such critical importance that I have felt it
                            necessary to bring it to your attention immediately. I shall deeply

                            Vargas the following message from me. (Please see that Aranha has a copy
                            of it at the same time that you hand it to President Vargas.)</p>

                                authorities of the Government of the United States of the
                                President’s desire that Your Excellency’s requests be promptly
                                complied with and that those authorities be informed of the

                            <p>In studying the military needs of Brazil, it now seems perfectly
                                clear that instead of 100 million dollars, at least 150 million
                                dollars will be required. I am happy to assure Your Excellency now
                                that an additional 50 million dollars can be made available to
                                Brazil and this Government will adjust its agreement with the
                                Brazilian Government accordingly. During the visit of Minister Souza
                                Costa to Washington, this new agreement can be concluded. Pending,
                                however, the formalities of such an agreement, this Government will
                                procure the additional material with the understanding, of course,
                                that nothing will be sent to Brazil that does not receive the prior

                                and munitions for the 10 tanks and 10 scout cars already in Brazil;
                                third, a priority for the completion by the Baldwin Locomotive
                                Company of twelve 7-inch cannon.</p>

                                today will receive direct word on these points.</p>

                                Navy Departments.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, may I state that if at any moment the urgent

                                I <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0653"/>shall appreciate it if

                        <p>General Amaro tells me that with the inclusion of the three points
                            mentioned in the latter part of my message to the President, the desires
                            of the Brazilian war department will be fully met. There will be no
                            trouble in so far as the Navy Department is concerned. The outstanding
                            gap, of course, is the question of the combat planes, but I feel sure
                            that some progress can be made along this line in the immediate
                            future.</p>
                        <p>In your conversation with the President, please make it doubly clear that
                            if for any reason he is not wholly satisfied with this response, all he
                            has to do is to let me know through you and I feel positive that
                            everything necessary can be done at this end to meet the situation.</p>

                            going the same evening to the Rezopolis.<note n="24" xml:id="d596fn24"

                                Castro, an official in the Brazilian Ministry for Foreign

                            to President Vargas the next day at Petropolis.</p>
                        <p>I telephoned Aranha yesterday morning that I was proceeding to Petropolis
                            and suggested that he meet me there: he did. When I showed him your
                            telegram he said “That’s just the old run around. You can’t show that to
                            President Vargas. Welles told him that you would give us equal treatment
                            with England, Russia, China—you are doing nothing of the kind; you are
                            dumping a lot of trucks on us; giving us nothing we need for the defense
                            of the northeast: anti-aircraft guns, artillery, combat planes. Tell
                            Welles he had better just file this away and forget it. Our military
                            people are going to raise hell with many I told you so’s. President
                            Vargas will never believe the State Department again”.</p>
                        <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0654"/>
                        <p>I made several appropriate observations and stuck to my guns that I would
                            see Vargas.</p>
                        <p>I saw Vargas who asked me to convey to you his appreciation and
                            gratitude. He said, “My offhand opinion is very good indeed (of course I
                            will consult my technicians). Welles is carrying out his promises to me.
                            This is not all we need but the fact that he is getting it to us before
                            the first of next month demonstrates his good faith (which I have never
                            doubted). Thank him for me and thank also President Roosevelt for his
                            cooperation. Tell Welles that we shall be expecting this material as
                            fast as he can send it.</p>
                        <p>I have full confidence that he appreciates our other urgent needs,
                            especially how badly we need artillery and anti-aircraft guns at
                            Fernando de Noronha, Natal, etc.; and that without combat planes we will
                            be helpless in the northeast”. (See General Miller’s memorandum to me
                            dated January 19, 1942 of which you have a copy entitled “Immediate
                            needs of Brazilian Army and Air Force for defense northeast
                                Brazil”.<note n="27" xml:id="d596fn27">Not found in Department

                        <p>As I left he repeated, “Tell Welles of my high appreciation and of my
                            full confidence in him”.</p>
                        <p>Aranha was waiting for me and when I told him of the results of my
                            conversation he said “I hope that he keeps to that opinion”.</p>

                        <p>307. From the Under Secretary. Your 371, February 7, noon. I showed your
                            telegram to the President yesterday. He was much amused by it.</p>
                        <p>Please tell Aranha from me that for once his uncanny intuition has been
                            in error. This is no “run around” and there is not going to be any “run
                            around”.</p>
                        <p>There has been created here in the Government a new board known as the
                            Munitions Allocations Board of which Harry Hopkins is the head and of
                            which General Burns<note n="28" xml:id="d597fn28">Maj. Gen. J. H.
                                Burns.</note> is the executive chief. This Board is subordinate only
                            to the President and is superior to every other branch of the Government
                            dealing with matters in this field.</p>
                        <p>I have just conferred with General Burns by instruction of the President
                            and I have arranged with General Burns to have his first meeting this
                            afternoon with Souza Costa. The needs of the Brazilian War Ministry,
                            Aviation Ministry and Ministry of Marine will be <pb n="643"
                                xml:id="pg_643" facs="0655"/>taken up in order and before the end of
                            this week, a satisfactory agreement as to future deliveries will be
                            reached in each case. I have emphasized to General Burns the
                            requirements mentioned in your telegrams 377, February 7, 6 p.m., and
                            379, February 7, 8 p.m.<note n="29" xml:id="d597fn29">Neither

                        <p>For the reasons above set forth, the next 3 or 4 days will be of
                            particular importance in finally clearing up the assignment of armament
                            and munitions for the Brazilian Government. In accordance with the
                            request contained in my telegram to you 276, February 5, 2 p.m., please
                            telegraph me any further specific requests or amendments which President
                            Vargas may have to make with regard to my message to him.</p>
                        <p>I am very much encouraged by the determination on the part of the
                            competent authorities here to give Brazil ample satisfaction naturally
                            within the limits of what is possible and reasonable under present

                        <p>371. From the Under Secretary. General Marshall and the War Department in
                            general are most desirous of taking immediate action in accordance with
                            the outline in your no. 334, February 3, 8 p.m., with respect to the 10
                            pursuits and 2 bombers; and they are exceedingly grateful to the Air
                            Ministry for its cooperation in this regard and its sympathetic
                            recognition of the problems of personnel and equipment faced by our
                            Army. The Air Ministry’s willingness to shorten the period of
                            adaptation, thus permitting the rapid release of our much needed
                            personnel, coincides exactly with the program of the War Department,
                            which sincerely appreciates this mark of collaboration.</p>
                        <p>In brief, the War Department accepts the Air Ministry’s proposal in its
                            broad outline. The minor differences from that proposal in the following
                            outline are merely dictated by the need for fitting it in with our
                            legislation and particularly our war plans, which the War Department
                            feels confident the Air Minister will readily understand.</p>

                                repeated that the War Department greatly appreciates the Air
                                Ministry’s cooperation in fixing this period of adaptation at a
                                maximum of 6 weeks. Anything which can be done further to shorten
                                the period will be helpful.</item>

                                    within a few days by United States Army crews of one pilot and
                                    one co-pilot per plane (some Brazilian air personnel at present
                                    in the United States may accompany the American crews). The
                                    United States personnel will remain for a short period of

                                    are in effect combat aircraft useful for oversea missions. Each
                                    carries three .30 caliber machine guns and four 100-pound bombs.

                            more appreciation than Aranha showed (my telegram No. 371, February 7,
                            12 noon) still he made some of the same criticisms Aranha made; and
                            remarked that “even the 25,000,000 had not yet been deposited”, et

                            arrangements concerning naval matériel. He has also expressed
                            satisfaction with the arrangements regarding aviation matériel now that
                            the 50 Vultee BT–15’s have been made available. He naturally hoped to be
                            able to secure some combat aircraft but appreciates the critical demand
                            for combat planes by troops of the United Nations now actually fighting.
                            A few combat planes will be made available.</p>
                        <p>With regard to ground matériel, instructions have been issued to have all
                            of this matériel scheduled for delivery during January and February
                            assembled at New Orleans for shipment on a Brazilian vessel March 7.
                            Moreover, in addition to the 20 light tanks which will be ready for
                            shipping on this vessel there will be assembled for delivery during
                            March at New Orleans or whatever other port Brazil selects an additional
                            30 light tanks. Thereafter, the regular scheduled delivery of 10 per
                            month will be maintained until 65 tanks are turned over. I regard this
                            arrangement concerning tanks as the utmost that could be obtained. The
                            extent to which we have gone to make these light tanks available is
                            clear from the fact that they have been taken away from our own troops,
                            which, on account of heavy deliveries to forces fighting the Axis in
                            Libya, in Russia, and in the Far East, are already insufficiently
                            supplied.</p>
                        <p>As a further indication of our desire to share available matériel with
                            the Brazilians, four antiaircraft guns, complete with fire control and a
                            reasonable amount of ammunition, are being immediately made available.
                            These guns have a range, I am told, of 30,000 to 35,000 feet. Dr. Souza
                            Costa has requested such guns for the protection of Natal, Belém and
                            Fernando de Noronha. These guns have been protecting a plant making a
                            vital piece of equipment.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the three urgently needed items mentioned in my telegram
                            no. 276, February 5, 2 p.m., the Brazilians have accepted 1,000
                            armor-piercing and 4,000 high-explosive 6-inch shells.</p>
                        <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0660"/>
                        <p>Armament and munitions for the 10 tanks and 10 scout cars already in
                            Brazil will be available for shipment on March 7. Finally, the highest
                            priority has been given for the modification of the 7-inch gun
                            carriages.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the spare parts mentioned in your 377, February 7, 6
                                p.m.,<note n="37" xml:id="d604fn37">Not printed.</note> a request
                            has today been presented to Mr. Hopkins that he make them immediately
                            available, and this will be done.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Souza Costa has also raised the question of a specific delivery
                            schedule for the other important items, such as light and medium tanks
                            and antiaircraft and antitank guns, for which requisitions have been
                            filed. Including aircraft, these items are among the most difficult to
                            furnish, since they are precisely the implements most needed by forces
                            now engaged in fighting. With the augmentation of production it should
                            be possible to make some deliveries on these items during the coming
                            months, and the War Department has stated that it anticipates all the
                            items in which Dr. Souza Costa has expressed particular interest can be
                            made available to Brazil prior to the end of the present calendar year.
                            It is, however, utterly impossible, in view of the war situation, as
                            well as shipping difficulties to make firm commitments now regarding
                            monthly deliveries. I will explain this to Dr. Souza Costa when he
                            returns from New York on Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>I suggest that you go over the foregoing with President Vargas, not only
                            to convey to him the factual information but to give him an idea of the
                            extent to which the President went to make available this equipment,
                            particularly the tanks and the four antiaircraft guns. Please assure the
                            President that every proper effort will be made to assure the delivery
                            of the other equipment for which requisitions have been filed during the
                            balance of the year but that it is not possible at this precise moment
                            to develop a fixed delivery schedule for the tight items such as light
                            and medium tanks and antiaircraft and antitank guns, and that this will
                            have to be agreed upon after the departure of Dr. Souza Costa.</p>

                        <p>428. From my personal telegram no. 427, of February 21, 8 p.m. I think
                            you will agree that the requests of the Brazilian Government with regard
                            to urgently-needed military and naval matériel have been met. As soon as
                            President Vargas is apprized of the results of the conversations of Dr.
                            Souza Costa I would appreciate your taking <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649"
                                facs="0661"/>up with him at once the matters which follow hereafter.
                            The President attaches the greatest importance to the conclusion
                            immediately of these arrangements with the Brazilian Government since
                            they will make possible the rapid ferrying of large numbers of planes to
                            north Africa and the Far East where they are critically and urgently
                            needed. The rapid passage of these planes and their immediate arrival at
                            fighting fronts will have an important bearing on the course of the
                            military operations now taking place.</p>
                        <p>The desires of the War Department are as follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) The War Department states that it is impossible for proper servicing
                            to be given to the planes crossing the Atlantic from Brazil to Africa
                            under the existing arrangement whereby the service personnel of Pan
                            American Airways services the aircraft. In the first place, Pan American
                            personnel is not sufficient to take care of the large number of planes
                            now flying in groups and which frequently require overnight servicing.
                            In the second place. Pan American personnel is not familiar with the
                            servicing of military planes. The War Department is desirous therefore
                            of sending service personnel as follows: 300 to Belém, 300 to Natal, and
                            150 to Recife. This personnel would cover the following functions:
                            administrative, communications, maintenance, supply, messing, weather,
                            and other technical details. The men would be in uniform but completely
                            unarmed. They would have no security function of any kind.</p>
                        <p>(2) The War Department would like permission to construct quarters;
                            barracks; administrative, technical and other similar accommodations at
                            each of the above-listed localities to accommodate the Air Corps
                            Ferrying Command squadrons concerned, plus an average of 100 transient
                            United States Government personnel. This construction at the present
                            time can be accomplished expeditiously by contract through Pan American
                            Airways, Inc. Such construction should be located immediately adjacent
                            to the land airdromes at Belém, Natal, and Recife.</p>
                        <p>(3) Under existing arrangements the prior approval of the Brazilian
                            Government must be obtained for all flights of United States military
                            aircraft except the 3-times-a-week ferry service. Although the Brazilian
                            Government has been most cooperative and attentive in granting
                            permissions, it would enormously facilitate matters if a blanket
                            permission could be granted. Weather conditions frequently make it
                            impossible for planes to fly at the stipulated times. Moreover, the more
                            people who know of these flights the greater the opportunity of the Axis
                            learning of their number, type, et cetera.</p>
                        <p>The War Department, therefore, would like to secure the privilege of the
                            free and unrestricted use of a corridor along the north coast of Brazil
                            and as far south as Recife for the movement of military aircraft. This
                            corridor has been defined as follows: a strip along the coast of the
                            northeastern portion of Brazil from the border of French Guiana at Cabo
                            d’Orange to Belém, thence continuing southeastward along the coast to
                            Natal and thence southwestward along the coast to Recife, the strip to
                            be approximately 100 miles in depth from the ocean in order to provide
                            for easier navigation and to avoid flight interferences due to weather.
                            If granted, the War Department would <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650"
                                facs="0662"/>move its planes along this corridor without requesting
                            the usual notification through diplomatic channels but information
                            regarding plane movements would be furnished directly to Brazilian
                            commanders at Belém and Natal by Air Corps Ferrying Command officials at
                            those places. It is contemplated that aircraft would move at the rate of
                            approximately 50 per day eastbound and a lesser number westbound.</p>
                        <p>(4) Permission is desired to construct underground bulk storage with
                            pipeline connections to dispersed lesser storage for approximately 1
                            million gallons of gasoline at Belém and Natal, and approximately
                            500,000 gallons of gasoline at Amapa, Fortaleza and Recife to support
                            the movement of combat echelons and United States’ military air
                            transportation as distinguished from local operations.</p>
                        <p>(5) Permission is requested to lengthen the runway to approximately 6,000
                            feet on Fernando de Noronha Island; to station a detachment of
                            approximately 50 officers and men from the Recife Air Corps Ferrying
                            Command squadron thereat for the final inspection of certain types of
                            aircraft to be flown across the South Atlantic; and to stock this
                            airdrome with approximately 500,000 gallons of gasoline supplies, spare
                            parts, communications and weather facilities, including the necessary
                            housing thereat.</p>
                        <p>The War Department, of course, is confident that the Brazilian Government
                            will provide local Brazilian security forces to safeguard the United
                            States movements along this corridor as well as the stockages of fuel
                            and facilities incident thereto along the corridor and on Fernando de
                            Noronha Island.</p>
                        <p>The War Department suggests that it should be helpful in securing
                            favorable action on the points mentioned above by making the two
                            following offers: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Air Corps Ferrying Command will arrange to provide invaluable

                                    acting in the capacity of copilot on 10 United States’ military
                                    transport type airplanes operating from Miami to Natal and
                                    return.</p>

                                    Natal by instructing such technicians in the maintenance of the
                                    latest types of combat aircraft being flown over the route.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Following the receipt of a favorable reply to these various propositions
                            General Olds, Commanding General of the Air Corps Ferrying Command, will
                            be glad to proceed at once to Brazil to confer in detail with Minister
                            Salgado and General Gomes in order to insure that the entire plan of
                            operation is put into effect to the full satisfaction of the Government
                            of Brazil.</p>
                        <p>Needless to say, I recognize the extent of cooperation which President
                            Vargas and his Government is being called upon to lend, but am confident
                            that he will unhesitatingly accord the privileges requested on account
                            of his understanding that we must cooperate, one with another, to the
                            fullest extent possible in order to attain the defeat of the
                            totalitarian nations. It has not been easy to convince our <pb n="651"
                                xml:id="pg_651" facs="0663"/>Army that tanks should be taken from
                            our own troops which are still very insufficiently supplied to send to
                            Brazil. Nor has it been easy to persuade the Army that the four
                            antiaircraft guns should be removed from a vital defense plant leaving
                            that plant without any antiaircraft protection to be sent to Brazil. The
                            President, however, has decided that this matériel be given to Brazil
                            because of considerations broader than the purely military which demand
                            today the closest working relationship between the two Governments. I
                            feel certain that President Vargas will consider the requests embodied
                            in this telegram in that same spirit. They are far-reaching and they
                            require a greater measure of cooperation from Brazil than ever before
                            requested in this field but this cooperation is vital to the winning of
                            the war in which Brazil and the United States are equally
                            interested.</p>

                        <p>558. For the Under Secretary. I shall take up your 428, February 21, 9
                            p.m., with President Vargas at an early date.</p>
                        <p>Aranha showed me on Saturday a report he had drawn up for President
                            Vargas regarding the three Marine detachments at Recife, Belém and
                            Natal, defending their presence there on the ground that they were
                            “service personnel” and only “service personnel,” insisting that they
                            were not guards or active Marines in any sense of the word. He said that
                            after he submitted this report to President Vargas, President Vargas
                            finally approved the presence of the three detachments.</p>
                        <p>Also only last week the Air Ministry was endeavoring to set up obstacles
                            in the way of our continuing our ferry service, et cetera, over
                            northeast Brazil; however, I believe that situation has now been
                            righted.</p>
                        <p>I am not saying these things as a pessimist, but only to bring out that
                            this is not going to be easy.</p>

                            points should be made entirely plain.</p>

                            <item>This Government has just given concrete evidence to Brazil of the
                                fact that even at great sacrifice to itself it is doing everything
                                possible to supply Brazil with her naval and military
                                requirements.</item>

                            <item>The defeat of the Axis powers is clearly as much in the interest
                                of Brazil as it is in the interest of the United States.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The ability of the United States effectively to assist in turning
                                the Japanese tide in the Far East depends to a desperately large
                                extent on our ability to rush the bombing planes rapidly to the Far
                                East. For that reason our Ferry Service must be expanded rapidly in
                                northeastern Brazil in order to take care of the largely increased
                                amount of planes we are now sending. In order to carry this out
                                effectively we have got to have trained and experienced technicians
                                to do the job. That is the sole reason why this request is being
                                made. If members of the Brazilian Air Force were properly trained
                                and experienced to do this work we would be asking them to do it for
                                us.</item>

                                of our Ferry Service will give Brazilian pilots an extraordinarily
                                valuable opportunity for practical training in the handling of
                                combat planes.</item>

                                once you have prepared the foundation for such discussion, he can
                                reach a satisfactory understanding through personal contacts with

                        <p>506. Your 609, February 26, 6 p.m. Yesterday afternoon I handed to Souza
                            Costa the memorandum quoted hereafter recapitulating the understandings
                            and arrangements arrived at through his conversations with regard to the
                            furnishing of armament to Brazil.<note n="40" xml:id="d610fn40"
                                >Memorandum not printed; the understandings consisted of a promise
                                to provide Brazil with some 60 primary and advanced training planes,
                                10 pursuit planes, and 2 bombers. Armament and ammunition for 10
                                light tanks and scout cars were offered as well as a small quantity
                                of armor piercing shells and high explosive rounds. Some 50 light
                                tanks and a few anti-aircraft guns were to be ready in the immediate
                                future with many more available in the fourth quarter of the
                                year.</note> I am happy to inform you that Souza Costa has since
                            advised me that not only he but also General Amaro consider that the
                            arrangements as set forth in the memorandum with regard to both
                            immediate deliveries and deliveries during the remainder of 1942 are 100
                            percent satisfactory. Souza Costa cabled a statement in this sense to
                            President Vargas last night. This helpful report should create a
                            favorable atmosphere for taking up the various requests desired by the

                        <p>I have seen the text of a telegram sent by President Vargas to Souza

                            commitments undertaken by this Government under the Lend Lease agreement
                            for the furnishing of military supplies for the balance of the current
                            year. The message made it emphatically clear that the President was
                            wholly satisfied. Souza Costa informed me that this message was sent
                            after President Vargas had consulted with General Dutra.<note n="42"

                        <p>624. I am sending you by air mail portions of three memoranda relating to
                            Brazil handed me by the War Department in connection with certain
                            projects for the construction of additional airports by Pan American
                                Airways.<note n="43" xml:id="d612fn43">War Department memoranda not
                                printed; portions of these memoranda were transmitted to the
                                Ambassador in Brazil by Mr. Welles in a letter of March 13, 1942
                                (not printed).</note> If you concur, General Olds will take this
                            matter up with the Brazilian authorities at the same time he discusses
                            with them the details of the questions regarding which President Vargas
                            has already given general approval.</p>
                        <p>Since it is now well known throughout the Americas that the airport
                            development program of Pan American Airways under the original program
                            was financed by this Government, and in view of the changed situation, I
                            think that such negotiations as may be required with the Brazilian
                            Government should be conducted by this Government rather than by Pan
                            American Airways as was done in the first program. Specific details on
                            the work proposed to be done on each site have been requested of the War
                            Department and will be forwarded as soon as received.</p>
                        <p>As you will note from one of the memoranda, the War Department is ready
                            to consider that the funds necessary for the construction work to be
                            done at Montes Claros, Carolina, Caravellas and Barreiras be either lent
                            or given to the Brazilian Government in order that that Government might
                            perform this work rather than Pan American Airways. The idea of the War
                            Department is that possibly the Brazilian Government would be pleased
                            and, therefore, more cooperative generally and specifically in
                            connection with the improvement of the other airports in Brazil which
                            are of greater strategic importance to this Government. The War
                            Department would, of course, be glad to lend the Brazilian Government
                            such engineers and advice as might be requested. Would you please
                            telegraph me whether, in your opinion, the Brazilian Government would be
                            pleased at this prospect, particularly if the funds are donated for the
                            purpose, so that the War Department can prepare an adequate statement
                            for your use in taking the matter up with the Brazilian authorities.</p>

                        <p>1025. For the Acting Secretary. President Vargas informed me today that
                            his military experts believe that an attack on the northeast of Brazil
                            can be expected by August this year, not with the intention of invading
                            Brazil, but for the purpose of destroying airports, installations, et
                            cetera, used by the ferry command. He added that his Air Force are
                            insisting on the absolute necessity of immediately obtaining the
                            following combat equipment which was requisitioned from us under
                            Lend-Lease on October 4 last: 40 pursuit planes P–47, P–39, or P–40E; 28
                            medium bombers B–25; 285 bombers A–24, and 14 patrol flying boats PBY, 6
                            of which should be amphibian.</p>

                            added that General Olds could confirm the critical need for this
                            material. You may recall that Olds, in his telegram to General
                                Arnold<note n="47" xml:id="d613fn47">Lt. Gen. Henry H. Arnold, Chief

                            least part of this equipment be made available while General Gomes is in

                        <p>820. Your No. 1025, March 25, 2 p.m. I submitted this question
                            immediately to General Arnold. I have this morning received a reply from
                            him which reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Replying to your letter of March 26th, during the stay of
                                    General Gomes in the United States discussions were held
                                    covering the Natal and Northeast Brazil situation. General Gomes
                                    agreed with me that while there is danger of an invasion of that
                                    area, the chances are that the worst that will probably happen
                                    will be a nuisance raid.</p>
                                <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0669"/>
                                <p>Everyone agrees that 30 Pursuit and 15 Medium and Light
                                    Bombardment airplanes would be very desirable as a complement
                                    for the Natal area. Unfortunately there are more insistent
                                    demands for these airplanes elsewhere in combat zones where they
                                    are employed by troops in contact with and operating against the
                                    enemy. As a compromise, I informed General Gomes that we would
                                    send to the Natal area six P–40’s and six B–25’s at once. He was
                                    very appreciative and when the difficulties covering the
                                    operation of so few planes over so many points were explained to
                                    him he was apparently quite satisfied.</p>
                                <p>In order that the maximum benefit may be obtained from these six
                                    P–40’s and six B–25’s, it was decided that American crews would
                                    man and maintain the planes pending the time when Brazilian
                                    crews could take them over, at which time the American combat
                                    and maintenance crews would be returned to the United
                                    States.</p>
                                <p>In the meantime, the question of air defense for the Natal area
                                    is still an open one and the solution of this question is
                                    subject to change, depending upon the trend of the war.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I suggest that until General Gomes has had an opportunity of talking over
                            with President Vargas and other officials of the Brazilian Government
                            the results of his trip to Washington, you might well refrain from
                            making any direct reply to the message from President Vargas. After you
                            have, yourself, talked with General Gomes, however, and if he is
                            apparently satisfied with the situation as indicated in General Arnold’s
                            above-quoted communication, you may then consider it expedient to give a

                        <p>931. In view of the reported presence of enemy submarines off the
                            Brazilian coast, the Navy Department urgently requests blanket
                            permission to operate United States Navy patrol planes from the land
                            fields at Fortaleza and São Luiz without prior notification.
                            Notification by the local United States naval commanding officer at
                            Natal to the local authorities would of course be made at the time of
                            beginning the operations. The area of particular interest is roughly
                            that stretch of the coast between São Luiz and Fortaleza.</p>
                        <p>This request does not involve the use of additional planes but only the
                            amphibian planes operating from Natal at present.</p>
                        <p>You may use your discretion in approaching Brazilian authorities. Urgent
                            reply requested.</p>

                                printed.</note> While the War Department is willing to pay for the
                            construction by the Brazilian Government of the airfields at Caravellas,
                            Montes Claros, Carolina, and Barreiras, it would, of course, prefer to
                            be relieved of this obligation since these airports have no present
                            military value. If, however, an offer to construct these airfields with
                            United States Government funds will assist you materially in obtaining
                            the necessary permission for the other airport development projects and
                            other matters desired by the War Department, you are authorized to
                            inform the Brazilian Government that the required funds will be made
                            available.</p>
                        <p>It should however be thoroughly understood by the Brazilians that (1)
                            United States aircraft will have free access to these fields, and (2)
                            that materials and machinery for their construction cannot be furnished
                            for probably a year or more (all machinery and material available is
                            currently needed for work on airfields of greater strategic
                            importance).</p>
                        <p>The Department believes that the construction of the airports mentioned
                            should be tied into the future development of Brazilian commercial
                            aviation and of the regions served, rather than represented as having
                            any immediate military value.</p>

                        <p>1022. In connection with the permission previously granted by the
                            Brazilian authorities for the operation of United States Navy patrol
                            planes from Maceió, Aratu (Bahia), Recife and Natal and, in order to
                            provide accommodations for flight and ground crews as well as to assure
                            adequate storage and maintenance facilities, the Navy Department
                            urgently desires that permission be obtained from the Brazilian
                            Government for the construction of the following additional aviation
                            facilities:</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) At Maceió a seaplane base; at Aratu (Bahia) a
                            seaplane base; at Recife a landplane base; at Natal a landplane
                            base.</p>
                        <p>In the case of each of the foregoing the following will be required:
                            Barracks, messing and sanitary facilities for 50 officers and <pb
                                n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0671"/>300 men; a radio building; a
                            nose hangar; additional underground storage adequate for 50,000 gallons
                            of gasoline; two ammunition magazines and additional land sufficient to
                            provide for all of the facilities aforementioned.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) It is also desired to construct a seaplane
                            base at Natal, the requirements for which will be identical with those
                            enumerated above, except that barracks, messing and sanitary facilities
                            for only 25 officers and 200 men are needed. Thus, at Natal, both
                            landplane and a seaplane bases are contemplated. </p>
                        <p>The Navy Department does not desire, for the present, that permission be
                            obtained for the erection of any facilities at Rio de Janeiro or
                            Santos.</p>
                        <p>It is contemplated that the new facilities would be constructed under a
                            contract with the Pan American Airways, Incorporated. These would, of
                            course, be additional to the work now being performed by that company
                            under the original contract of November 2, 1940, consisting primarily of
                            the construction of surfaced runways for each landplane base, a ramp for
                            each seaplane base and surfaced parking areas and gasoline storage at
                            all of the bases and the recent supplemental contract.</p>
                        <p>While the additional area of land required at the four bases will vary
                            somewhat according to the terrain and other local factors, it is
                            estimated that approximately 30 acres, exclusive of the area required
                            for magazines, will be needed in each instance. Owing to the necessity
                            for placing magazines at a distance of between 1,000 and 2,000 feet from
                            other structures, a study will have to be made at each base in order to
                            determine, on the basis of security, accessibility and land
                            requirements, the most suitable location. It is proposed that, in
                            accordance with previous practice, the land will be purchased by and
                            title taken in the name of the Pan American Airways, Incorporated.</p>
                        <p>In view of the urgency of this matter, you are requested in your
                            discretion at once to endeavor to obtain the desired permission of the
                            Brazilian authorities and to reply by telegraph.</p>

                                    is growing more and more serious. We have placed in that region,
                                    for the Brazilians, the following planes: <list>
                                        <item>10 P–36s (pursuit)</item>

                                <p>Lieutenant Colonel Thomas B. Hall, Air Corps, is our senior Air

                                    of these planes. To give you a first-hand picture of the
                                    existing conditions I am quoting from a personal letter of
                                    Colonel Hall to one of his friends in the War Department, which
                                    has accidentally come to my attention.</p>
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>‘The troubles are the following: no 100-octane gasoline, and
                                        we have not flown for a week. Another is lack of
                                        pilots—there are only three who have taken instruction on
                                        the B–18s, and about five actually flying the old P–36s.</p>
                                    <p>Colonel Macedo has requested more pilots and no action has
                                        been taken. No thought has yet been given to such a thing as
                                        training bombardiers or navigators, or even co-pilots.</p>
                                    <p>The B–25s (medium bomber) have been here almost a week and
                                        Macedo has been the only officer even to look at them. Even
                                        Macedo has not wanted to fly.</p>
                                    <p>The worst thing is over the matter of where the units will be
                                        stationed; that is as much in the air as when you left and
                                        it prevents us from taking any steps towards the
                                        establishment of the gunnery range or the bombing range, or
                                        to make any revetments, etc. Our people who came down here
                                        full of vim and vigor and ready to set the world on fire are
                                        about to give up after sitting around in this place doing
                                        nothing. It is a shame and it makes one sick to see that
                                        fine equipment lying idle, but there has never been stronger
                                        proof of our stand.</p>
                                    <p>The lack of organization, equipment and pilots makes the
                                        airplanes useless. As far as I can determine, nothing is
                                        being done about it either. The lack of enthusiasm of the
                                        Brazilians to fly the planes is the thing which surprises me
                                        most.’</p>

                                <p>It seems evident from the foregoing that we can expect
                                    practically no patrol protection in support of our Navy over the
                                    Brazilian waters off the coast of Northeastern Brazil. With the
                                    present submarine menace this is a very serious matter involving
                                    both heavy losses of tonnage and the repercussions of Latin
                                    America due to our failure to protect shipping. There is also
                                    the deadly hazard of sudden Fifth Column events in that area, to
                                    cut off our air communications with the Near and Far East and to
                                    menace the Panama Canal.</p>
                                <p>With reference to the last comment, we consider it of great
                                    military importance to have an immediate aerial reconnaissance
                                    of the Amazon above Manaos in the Rio Branco-Rio Negros area.
                                    Our proposal was that we would fly the planes with Brazilian
                                    co-pilots and a partial Brazilian crew to make this
                                    reconnaissance. The Air Minister agreed. General Gomes canceled
                                    this agreement and stated that Brazil would make the
                                    reconnaissance for us in 4 days. Actually this reconnaissance
                                    would require 28 days of flying 10 hours daily, using 8
                                    airplanes having a 1600-mile range, and operating from Manaos.
                                    The ‘4–days’ reply really stated an absurdity. The region
                                    referred to is a vast natural landing ground from which an
                                    attack on vital installations of the Panama Canal could be
                                    launched.</p>
                                <p>These matters are growing so deadly serious that, as Chief of
                                    Staff, I feel that something must be done immediately or we must
                                    frankly <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0673"/>accept the
                                    possibility of a disastrous development in the Panama-Brazilian
                                    theater.</p>
                                <p>The War Department has made real sacrifices in many directions to
                                    satisfy Brazilian requirements in military equipment in support
                                    of the position taken by the State Department that a definite
                                    betterment of the situation in Northeast Brazil would result. We
                                    have relieved officers at the request of our Ambassador—officers
                                    of superior qualifications. I have changed the assignments of
                                    officers in the War Department concerned with the Brazilian
                                    situation because they had become so convinced that our failure
                                    to secure the necessary precautionary measures would result in a
                                    disaster in that region that their feelings were too intense to
                                    facilitate negotiations.</p>
                                <p>… I, therefore, request that you instruct our Ambassador in Rio
                                    to present again to the Brazilian Air Ministry the urgent
                                    necessity for utilizing to the maximum advantage the American
                                    planes and instructors now in Brazil. Specifically, he should
                                    secure agreements for the use of both American and Brazilian
                                    pilots and crews for the immediate detailed and effective
                                    reconnaissance of the Amazon area. Also, arrangements should be
                                    made to undertake without further delay the training of
                                    Brazilian pilots and crews in the use of the 24 American planes,
                                    using American personnel as instructors. It is especially
                                    important that during the training period, the matériel and
                                    personnel (American pilots and bombardiers) involved, should be
                                    utilized in extending patrol activities off the Brazilian coast.
                                    I suggest that General Eduardo Gomes should be included, if
                                    possible, in any conferences held on the matter.”</p>

                        <p>Please telegraph me your reactions. In view of the very serious concern
                            shown by General Marshall in this regard, I think it imperative that you
                            take as effective action as in your judgment may be possible. This issue
                            seems to me one that, under normal conditions, you would wish to lay
                            personally before President Vargas, but, of course, I do not know if the
                            present state of his health is sufficiently good to make this possible.

                        <p>1364. From the Under Secretary. Against the opposition of our own Navy,
                            and only due to personal instructions given by the President,
                            arrangements were finally made by the Navy Department to escort to
                            Trinidad the five Brazilian vessels loaded with lend-lease material. It
                            was clearly understood by the Brazilian Embassy here that the commanders
                            of these vessels would scrupulously obey the orders given by the
                            convoying authorities.</p>
                        <p>I have just received the following letter from the Vice Chief of Naval
                                operations:<note n="59" xml:id="d620fn59">Vice Adm. Frederick J.

                                    which I believe you should have as apparently two of the

                                    meantime there appears there is nothing you can do as the matter

                        <p>I have communicated this information to the Brazilian Ambassador, who is
                            informing President Vargas by direct cable. The Ambassador is suggesting
                            that the Brazilian Navy, through the Brazilian Naval Attaché in
                            Washington, assume jurisdiction over the commanders of these vessels in
                            the place of the agents of Lloyd Brasileiro.</p>
                        <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0675"/>
                        <p>I know you appreciate the sacrifice which the convoying of these vessels
                            involves to us at the present time. If these vessels are sunk, the loss
                            will be very great from the standpoint of the Brazilian Army. Moreover,
                            each one of the vessels had guns which we had supplied and American
                            armed guards on board which we had lent. The unwillingness of the
                            captains of these Brazilian ships to obey the orders issued to them by
                            the American naval authorities seems to me nothing short of criminal in
                            the light of circumstances. I hope you will take this matter up
                            vigorously and support the Ambassador’s recommendation that the
                            Brazilian Navy should assume the responsibility and that none of these
                            vessels should proceed except under orders given directly to them by the
                            Brazilian Navy in cooperation with our own naval authorities.

                        <p>1513. From the Under Secretary. Your 1807, May 28, 9 p.m. I have received

                                <p>“With reference to the request for the extension of the duty of
                                    the United States Army Air Force pilots and enlisted personnel,
                                    their original instructions were to remain until proper
                                    transition of Brazilian pilots had been completed, and I will,
                                    in consequence, authorize them to remain another month as
                                    requested, although the situation with respect to trained Air
                                    Corps personnel is extremely critical at this time in our own
                                    armed forces.</p>
                                <p>With respect to additional B–25’s, the present procurement status
                                    of these aircraft precludes further deliveries of this type. I
                                    could not recommend additional transfers to Brazil at present,
                                    nor do I believe that the Munitions Assignment Board would
                                    authorize such transfers. However, I am informed that the
                                    Munitions Assignment Board has allotted to the Brazilian
                                    Government 18 A–29 Lockheed Light Bombers and 28 A–31 Dive
                                    Bombers, for delivery from August through December of this year,
                                    inclusive. These aircraft are suited for the missions now being
                                    performed by the B–25’s, and may be employed to supplement and
                                    augment present operations.</p>
                                <p>With respect to antiaircraft machine guns, the adequate defense
                                    of the airfields in Northeast Brazil has been studied by the War
                                    Department and will be discussed in the conference of the Joint
                                    Brazil–United States Defense Commission which will meet in
                                    Washington in the near future.”</p>

                                    between Brazil on the one hand and Germany and Italy on the
                                    other hand.</p>

                                <p>The people of the United States welcome the people of Brazil as
                                    brothers in arms and salute their high resolve and defiant
                                    courage in taking a position unequivocally at the side of the
                                    embattled freedom-loving nations of the world. Today a heavy
                                    blow has been dealt the Axis Powers, moral no less than
                                    military, when a great, peaceful and law-abiding nation is
                                    driven by unprovoked acts of ruthless barbarity to take up arms
                                    in self-defense. It comes as no surprise to my countrymen that
                                    the proud Brazilian Nation has chosen the risks and hardships of
                                    battle when confronted with wanton attacks on its sovereign
                                    dignity and rights.</p>
                                <p>The action of the Axis powers in attacking your great country and
                                    people is a further demonstration of the fact that those Powers
                                    will strike at any peace-loving nation as and when to do so will
                                    serve their purpose of world conquest, regardless of
                                    considerations of humanity and international law. It also brings
                                    into bold relief the basic principle upon which the solidarity
                                    of the American republics rests, namely, that an attack against
                                    any one of them is an attack against all of them. Each of the
                                    twenty-one American Republics are today equally in danger.</p>
                                <p>Together our two countries will face the future with serene
                                    confidence and high hearts.</p>
                                <p>I take pleasure in sending Your Excellency renewed assurances of
                                    my high personal esteem.</p>

                                printed.</note> War Department states that the question of
                            expediting delivery of combat airplanes to Brazil has been discussed by
                            Joint Brazilian-United States Defense Commission, which recommended an
                            advance of delivery dates. In pursuance of this recommendation, the War
                            Department has advanced the delivery dates of 18 A–29 medium bombers to
                            be used by Brazilian air force for anti-submarine patrol, so that
                            delivery will be completed by the end of October instead of the end of
                            December. The Defense Commission is also studying the acceleration of
                            delivery dates on other types of planes for Brazil. In deciding this
                            matter, it will be necessary to consider the ability of Brazilian air
                            force to absorb these planes and establish necessary ground crews and
                            facilities for their efficient maintenance and operation.</p>
                        <p>The question of delivering the 18 A–29 planes by United States Army
                            training crews is also receiving earnest and sympathetic consideration.
                            It is expected that a decision will be reached early this week. For your
                            own information, War Department states that there is a shortage of
                            training crews owing to the need of this personnel for combat operations
                            in other parts of the world. It is hoped, however, <pb n="669"
                                xml:id="pg_669" facs="0681"/>that it will be possible to send one of
                            these crews for each three planes delivered in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the defense needs of the bases, the Defense Commission
                            will recommend to War Department the assignment of small caliber
                            anti-aircraft guns. The critical need for large caliber antiaircraft
                            artillery in other theaters prevents allocation of any such material at
                            this time.</p>

                            been set up at Washington councils and boards consequent upon the
                            declaration. He asked me what they are.</p>
                        <p>He repeated that Brazil has no interest in the United Nations; but a
                            great deal of interest in cooperating with us. “If you want us to sign”
                            he said, “we will sign. Should this be done with some formality; and
                            where. Spell out to me exactly what you want us to do.”</p>
                        <p>(This is a typical Aranha sort of move.)</p>

                            Brazil decided to adhere to United Nations Declaration and that Aranha
                            was studying Declaration and Mexican communication of adherence. In
                            reply to his query as to what he should do, you may refer again to the
                            Mexican communication for form of adherence. After Brazilian willingness
                            to adhere has been received here arrangements could be made for
                            appropriate public ceremony at Washington and if desired, simultaneously

                        <p>I believe that Aranha will realize the obvious advantages of having

                                    received that six of the airplanes were ready to leave the
                                    States very soon. As yet, not one has been delivered.</p>
                                <p>(2) This failure not only to heed the request for accelerated
                                    delivery, but to comply with the original terms of the delivery
                                    schedule, has had deeply-felt results in the Brazilian Air Force
                                    as you probably know. It has particularly caused Brigadiero
                                    Gomes great distress and anxiety.</p>
                                <p>He is charged with a huge responsibility in furnishing air patrol
                                    for shipping and by no means has the equipment to properly
                                    accomplish the job. Me as well as ourselves realizes that the
                                    combat <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0685"/>fronts are of
                                    first importance but it is believed that the airplanes scheduled
                                    for delivery could be spared.</p>
                                <p>(3) Undoubtedly you are completely aware of the situation and the
                                    Air Minister has probably discussed it thoroughly. This is
                                    written only to add my request that all possible steps be taken
                                    to bring about, at the least, fulfillment of the schedule.”</p>

                        <p>3320. From the Under Secretary. Your 4413, October 27, 6 p.m. According
                            to information obtained from the War Department, the Munitions
                            Assignments Board has approved the assignment of 18 of these planes for
                            delivery in October and 10 in November. They were in process of
                            manufacture for the British and before delivery can be made to Brazil,
                            they must receive certain additional necessary accessories. This work is
                            now being completed, and every effort is being made to expedite the
                            delivery of these airplanes to Brazil. [Welles.]</p>

                            response to your request copies of Recommendations 1 to 7, of the Joint

                            the approval of the Brazilian authorities before action could be taken
                            by our War or Navy Department and that action on Recommendations 6 and 7
                            was pending in the War Department. We have now heard from the War
                            Department that the senior member of the Brazilian delegation has
                            reported that the Brazilian Government has approved these
                            recommendations. In addition, Recommendations 6 and 7 have received the
                            War Department’s approval and action is being taken to put them into
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>Recommendations 8 to 10 have been made by the Defense Commission. They
                            have been approved by the War Department and are being forwarded to Rio
                            de Janeiro in order to obtain the approval of the Brazilian Government.

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the
                            Embassy has recently reviewed the operations of the first six months of
                            the United States-Brazil Strategic Materials Agreement<note n="85"
                                xml:id="d637fn85">See telegrams Nos. 460, May 13, 3 p.m., and 466,
                                May 14. 8 p.m., from the Ambassador in Brazil, <ref
                                    target="frus1941v06"><hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi></ref>, section
                                under Brazil entitled “Arrangements to procure for the United States
                                strategic materials from Brazil.”</note> with the view to
                            formulating suggestions which might be of value in the adoption of a
                            procurement program in Brazil to meet war needs in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Probably the most important accomplishment of the agreement, prior to the
                            entrance of the United States into the war, was the <pb n="675"
                                xml:id="pg_675" facs="0687"/>shutting-off of Axis sources of supply
                            for strategic materials. The actual procurement policies followed by the
                            purchasing agencies have been, with the exception of two or three
                            commodities, very limited in scope. No purpose would be served by
                            reviewing the cases of lost opportunities either in the actual
                            procurement of needed materials or in the development of future sources
                            of supply. It should be mentioned, however, that whatever validity there
                            may have been for an over-cautious buying policy on the part of the
                            purchasing agencies, it is apparent that a basic change in procurement
                            policies and methods of administration is essential to the war
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>The changed situation would appear to dictate an expansion in the list of
                            commodities which should be made subject to bilateral agreement between
                            the United States and Brazil and a reconsideration of the quantitative
                            undertakings for certain of the commodities now included in the
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy assumes that the objectives of the authorities in the United
                            States are to maximize the production and exportation to the United
                            States and allied nations of Brazilian strategic materials, and to adapt
                            this program in such a manner as to maintain amicable relations with
                            Brazil and to minimize points of friction. The attainment of the first
                            objective is in a large measure dependent upon the second.</p>
                        <p>Taking into consideration the importance of the time element, it would
                            appear that the most effective type of program requires a revision of
                            procurement policies on the part of the government purchasing agencies,
                            a more effective organization within the Brazilian Government and an
                            administrative organization in Brazil of American governmental
                            representatives which would make possible a maximum of correlation and
                            integration of effort. Procurement policies, to be most effective,
                            should get away from the concepts of world market prices which are in
                            many cases greatly influenced by conditions in countries having
                            efficient and well-established production. Each commodity should be
                            studied separately and consideration given to the adoption of any device
                            which would expand output, subject, of course, to the qualification that
                            a larger supply of a given Brazilian commodity is of value to the war
                            program. Such devices might include increased prices, bounties for all
                            production above a normal level, long-term contracts to make projects
                            more attractive to Brazilian capital, advances for equipment and other
                            working capital requirements, and possibly outright investment.</p>
                        <p>A number of Brazilian Government agencies are concerned in one way or
                            another with the production and distribution of Brazilian materials and
                            the Embassy has in the past experienced many delays <pb n="676"
                                xml:id="pg_676" facs="0688"/>in attempting to obtain action

                            measures which will permit more rapid action. The Embassy has already
                            informally approached the Brazilian Government with a proposal to form a
                            joint defense materials committee to meet periodically and to be
                            composed of the Chief of the Economic Section of the Ministry of Foreign

                            pointed out at this meeting that with the rights which the United States
                            had acquired to monopolistic purchases of Brazilian strategic materials,
                            there had been created a corresponding obligation on the part of the
                            Government of the United States to so administer its procurement program
                            as to minimize points of friction and to eliminate factors which tended
                            to create dislocations in Brazil’s national economy. It was mentioned
                            that decisions made in Washington from day to day and communicated to
                            New York to be transmitted to a purchasing agency in Brazil to buy or to
                            cease buying, frequently resulted in unnecessary disturbances in Brazil.
                            It was further pointed out that there were many factors involved in a
                            procurement program for a given commodity; that these included not only
                            those of direct purchases, but also of rail transportation, storage,
                            water transportation, correlation with British purchases, and a
                            multitude of intergovernmental problems. It was mentioned that frequent
                            and unanticipated changes in buying policy made in Washington and
                            communicated directly to the purchasing agency in Brazil had had
                            unfavorable political repercussions which could have been avoided had
                            the matter been first referred to the Embassy.</p>
                        <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0689"/>
                        <p>At the same time, it was recognized that a number of government agencies
                            in Washington were sending representatives to Brazil to make mining,
                            agricultural or transport studies, and that their activities should be
                            made subject to supervision and directed into channels where they could
                            give the most direct assistance to the expansion of output of needed
                            materials.</p>
                        <p>It was likewise agreed that there should be organized within the Embassy
                            a defense materials unit to correlate and integrate all of these
                            activities and to provide a more adequate statistical and research
                            service.</p>
                        <p>Finally, great importance was placed on the formation of a company
                            subsidiary to the Federal Loan Agency (as are the commodity companies
                            such as the Metals Reserve Company), organized on a geographical basis
                            in Brazil, to handle all procurement activities for the Federal Loan
                            Agency. Such a company should be given, within the framework of broad
                            policies formulated in Washington, necessary authority to make decisions
                            locally and to act promptly and effectively in taking advantage of every
                            opportunity to increase the flow of needed materials to the United
                            States. It is believed that such an organization, with adequate powers,
                            would be able to assume the initiative in developing worthwhile projects
                            and that many of the delays currently being experienced through the
                            necessity of referring details to the United States could be
                            avoided.</p>
                        <p>There is enclosed a chart<note n="88" xml:id="d637fn88">Not
                                printed.</note> of the proposed organizational set-up for the
                            defense materials program in Brazil, as agreed upon at the meeting under
                            reference. In regard to the question of communications, it was thought
                            that all matters of general policy, as well as matters which involve any
                            change in buying policy should be channelized through the Embassy. There
                            is, of course, no objection to direct correspondence on detailed
                            matters, which in no way relate to a change in policy or to
                            intergovernmental matters, between the Federal Loan Agency and its
                            subsidiaries and the procurement organization in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate the comments of the Department and other interested
                            agencies in regard to the organizational plan under reference.</p>

                        <p>242. As you know, one of the matters which Mr. Warren Pierson plans to
                            negotiate while at Rio de Janeiro is a proposed financing by the
                            Reconstruction Finance Corporation of the opening of the Itabira mine
                            and the improvement of the rail facilities running from that mine to the
                            Port of Victoria. The Itabira mine is located on one of the largest low
                            phosphorous iron ore deposits in the world, but due to the lack of
                            capital and lack of proper rail facilities, it has never been put into
                            commercial production.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson is also planning to negotiate with the Brazilian authorities
                            and private companies a loan to enable the Central Railway to carry
                            larger quantities of manganese and iron ore to the port of Rio de
                            Janeiro and also to finance the improvement of the loading facilities at
                            the port of Rio de Janeiro. This proposal with the Itabira plan
                            constitute one unitary project.</p>
                        <p>Since Mr. Pierson’s departure, the Department has been studying these
                            projects further and it has become apparent that the successful
                            completion of these negotiations is of the utmost importance to the
                            British-American war effort. It is hoped that if Mr. Pierson’s
                            negotiations are successful, there will be made available in increasing
                            quantities up to a total of 50,000 tons or more monthly of low
                            phosphorous ore. At the moment the combined British-American supply of
                            such low phosphorous ore is approximately 35,000 tons a month below
                            current needs of United States and Great Britain. This low phosphorous
                            ore goes into the making of high grade steels necessary for the
                            construction of guns, tanks, armor piercing shells, and various other
                            war weapons. The successful conclusion of the project with respect to
                            the Central Railway would increase substantially the available manganese
                            and iron ore from the mines feeding the Central Railway. This iron ore
                            is used for a different purpose than the Itabira ore but it and the
                            manganese are considered to be of an importance equal with that of the
                            Itabira project.</p>
                        <p>The Department accordingly believes that it is necessary to strengthen
                            the negotiations which Mr. Pierson is expected to carry on by
                            establishing these negotiations at a high level where commercial
                            considerations, methods of negotiation and questions of cost will be of
                            minor importance. It is therefore suggested for your consideration that
                            unless the Under Secretary of State<note n="89" xml:id="d638fn89">Under
                                Secretary Sumner Welles attended the Third Meeting of the Foreign

                                to the United States on January 29.</note> or you have done so <pb
                                n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0691"/>already, you speak to Foreign
                            Minister Aranha about these two projects and inform him that in the view
                            of this Government rapid and comprehensive development of the mines and
                            communications under efficient management can only be secured by the
                            direct intervention of the Brazilian Government. It is further suggested
                            that you regard these two projects as of the highest importance and that
                            you take an active and leading position in the negotiations with respect
                            to them. In the meantime the Department will discuss the matter with
                                Souza-Costa<note n="90" xml:id="d638fn90">Arthur de Souza Costa,

                        <p>327. For the Under Secretary. Department’s 242, January 31. I have
                            discussed these projects with Aranha<note n="91" xml:id="d639fn91"
                                >Oswaldo Aranha, Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> who
                            expressed real interest. He and Souza-Costa told Pierson on Sunday that
                            the Brazilian Government would cooperate.</p>
                        <p>We have all agreed that Costa will discuss details familiarizing Pierson
                            (who is accompanying him to the United States) and other officials of
                            our Government in Washington this week.</p>
                        <p>The plan of action as agreed upon in principle provides (1) Brazilian
                            Government to acquire Victoria E. A. Railway; (2) our Government to
                            arrange for priorities and finance purchase of railway equipment; (3)
                            dollar loan to be amortized by shipment of ore [apparent omission]
                            freight rebates; (4) Brazilian Government to finance milreis
                            expenditures; (5) American engineers to cooperate in reconstruction and
                            administration of railway; (6) Itabira mines to be operated by a company
                            composed of Brazilians, Americans, British.</p>
                        <p>We need Costa’s cooperation to settle the railway problem and his
                            assistance will depend upon the success of his mission to the United

                        <p>495. For the Under Secretary. Aranha agrees with me that the Brazilian
                            Government should appoint a small but well-selected committee of
                            officials of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance and the Bank
                            of Brazil to administer the strategic materials agreement. However, he
                            is reluctant to name the committee and to give it broad powers without
                            the approval of Souza Costa.</p>
                        <p>I am told that the Ministry of Finance is responsible for the
                            unnecessarily long delays in passing on our requests to add commodities
                            to the agreement. As the situation is becoming worse I strongly
                            recommend that you ask Souza Costa to telegraph Aranha requesting him to
                            name the committee. It would also be helpful if Souza Costa would
                            instruct his Ministry to despatch pending cases at once.</p>

                        <p>454. In keeping with Resolution II of the Rio de Janeiro Meeting of
                            Foreign Ministers, conversations have been held with Souza Costa and his
                            colleagues, in which the Brazilian Ambassador participated, looking to
                            the establishment in Brazil of an organization under Brazilian
                            Governmental sponsorship and control to increase the production of
                            strategic materials and other natural resources. The new organization
                            would examine all feasible projects for such development and would see
                            that those recommended be effected either by existing enterprises in
                            Brazil or, where suitable entities do not already exist, by new
                            organizations which would be established for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>The overall organization would be a non-profit one. It would utilize to a
                            very considerable degree United States expert assistance. In addition to
                            funds for local expenditures to be supplied by Brazil, a substantial
                            line of dollar credit would have to be allocated by the Federal Loan
                            Agency to be drawn against as needed for dollar expenditures in
                            connection with specific projects. The Federal Loan Agency would, of
                            course, have the right to approve or disapprove specific undertakings.
                            For your strictly confidential information, the amount now under
                            discussion is $100,000,000, and, while it is anticipated <pb n="681"
                                xml:id="pg_681" facs="0693"/>that this sum will be forthcoming, it
                            is not as yet definitely committed.</p>
                        <p>Agreement in principle has been reached here with the Brazilians on the
                            aforedescribed plan. Souza Costa is telephoning Aranha and said that, if
                            his Government approves, we will proceed rapidly with an exchange of
                            notes to formalize the matter.</p>
                        <p>Quite aside from the urgent need for the materials to be produced and the
                            stabilizing effect on hemisphere economy, it is believed that the public
                            announcement of a program of the kind described, particularly one
                            involving such a high line of credit, should have a salutary effect on
                            the Brazilian public, as well as in the public minds of the other
                            American republics.</p>
                        <p>Discussions are also proceeding between Souza Costa, the Department and
                            the Export-Import Bank, of a plan and agreement for development of

                            opinion, which the Department shares, that the appointment of such a
                            committee might appropriately be deferred until the conclusion of
                            negotiations now going on in Washington which may result in an agreement
                            for the establishment of a development corporation by the Government of
                            Brazil. This development corporation might make the selected committee

                        </quote>
                        <p>With regard to hides, wool and babassu nuts, no specific proposals are
                            under consideration at the present time. In consultation with Mc-Ashan,
                            however, you are requested to discuss the situation with respect to each
                            of these commodities with the appropriate Brazilian authorities and
                            transmit to the Department any specific proposals which might be
                            advanced by the Brazilians. In the case of babassu nuts, some concern
                            has been expressed here over the possibility that a development program
                            for this product would divert labor from the production of rubber, which
                            is more urgently needed. This aspect should be explored with the
                            Brazilians. In addition, you are requested to inform the Department of
                            any recent developments in connection with the General Mills babassu
                            program.</p>

                            purposes of this program the expenditure of approximately 11,500 contos
                            in 1942 and 11,500 contos in 1943, from the regular budgets of the

                            <p>Ambassador Caffery said that the coffee and cocoa transactions would
                                be handled through established commercial channels and in accordance
                                with existing commercial practice. The coffee agreement provides
                                that the United States through the Commodity Credit Corporation will
                                purchase or underwrite the entire unshipped portion of the United
                                States quota for Brazilian coffee which expired September 30, 1941,
                                and in addition guarantees Brazil the purchase by the United States
                                of 9,300,000 bags of the 1943 Brazilian quota year.</p>

                            <p>The cocoa agreement provides that the United States will purchase
                                about 1,300,000 of Baia cocoa between October 1942 and March 1943.
                                These purchases will be made by the Commodity Credit
                                Corporation.</p>
                            <p>Under the Brazil nut accord the Rubber Reserve Company of the United

                                in the 1942 season.</p>

                            <p>Commenting on the agreements Ambassador Caffery said: ‘The agreements
                                speak volumes for the farsighted administrations of Presidents
                                Franklin D. Roosevelt and Getulio Vargas, and afford one more
                                realistic example of the vast range of practical cooperation between
                                Brazil and the United States. They go far toward removing as far as
                                humanly possible the uncertainties of war, and their depressing
                                effects on these industries’.”</p>

                            interdepartmental arrangements. We urge therefore that formal
                            organization be completed at earliest possible moment, even if necessary
                            to delay until later date the full dress ceremony which Brazilian

                            naturally reduces period during which Eximbank will be able to obtain

                            extend reimbursement period from 20 years to 30 years. This will involve
                            merely substituting 30 for 20 annual notes and, of course, 30 instead of

                        <p>916. For Rubber Reserve. Department’s 640, March 13, 7 p.m. I have
                            informed the Brazilian Government and the Bank of Brazil. Dr. Truda of
                            the Bank of Brazil<note n="30" xml:id="d657fn30">Leonardo Truda,
                                Director of the Export-Import Section of the Bank of Brazil.</note>
                            is of the opinion that the Government will expect Rubber Reserve to
                            provide for shipping arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Truda says that the Government must promulgate a decree law
                            establishing a single selling agency. He will discuss this and other
                            matters with Souza Costa<note n="31" xml:id="d657fn31">Arthur de Souza

                            returning today.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Truda intends to establish buying offices at Belém and Manáos to
                            purchase at the fixed price less a small discount for expenses of the
                            selling agency, reselling only to established consumers within Brazil
                            and to Rubber Reserve. He will maintain a uniform selling price for
                            domestic and export trade. He estimates domestic consumption at a
                            maximum of 10,000 tons annually.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Truda is in complete agreement with the provisions of paragraph 3. He
                            says that Brazil has recently exported 165 tons to Venezuela, 20 tons to
                            Chile, and that the Government will authorize shipment of 150 tons to
                            Argentina which were purchased several months ago but he will not
                            approve other requests.</p>
                        <p>He will adopt measures to prevent hoarding rubber by non-consumers.</p>

                            tons of rubber to Argentina would appear to violate terms of notes and
                            rubber purchase agreements, as substance of these is that after date of
                            signature Brazil will permit exportation of rubber only to this country.
                            You are requested to point this out to Dr. Truda and obtain his
                            cooperation in preventing this shipment.</p>

                            should be able to get them from Brazil. The reason they cannot get the
                            tires is that on an overall basis, considering the essential needs of
                            the United States, the United Kingdom and the American republics, there
                            is not sufficient rubber to make them. The factors outlined in the
                            circular telegram demonstrate the necessity for making fully effective
                            the provision of the agreements with Brazil <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698"

                                <item>It appears to the Department to be necessary to reach an
                                    agreement as soon as possible as to the manufactured products to
                                    be purchased by the Rubber Reserve Company.</item>

                                <item>As to manufactured products, the Department suggested to you,
                                    and it is believed that you agree, that there should be two
                                    restrictions as to these products which should be included
                                    within the agreement to be made with the Brazilian
                                    Government.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The first restriction should be as to the types of the
                                    products to be manufactured. The test which is suggested is that
                                    the same standards should apply in Brazil as apply in the United
                                    States. As we said, this principle has been readily accepted by
                                    Peru in recent negotiations which have just been concluded,<note

                                        entitled “Cooperation between the United States and Peru in
                                        the mobilization of the economic resources of Peru;
                                        agreement for purchase by the Rubber Reserve Company of
                                        surplus Peruvian rubber.”</note> and we have suggested the
                                    same standard to certain other American republics who have
                                    indicated a willingness to go along with this principle of
                                    equality of use. This accordingly would mean that in the
                                    proposed Brazilian agreements some effort should be made to
                                    limit the types of goods to be manufactured so as to eliminate
                                    luxury products to the same extent that the manufacture of these
                                    goods is limited in the United States.</item>

                                <item>The second limitation would be to limit the quantity of such
                                    permissible goods as might be manufactured. It is obvious that
                                    there must be a quantitative limitation as well as a qualitative
                                    limitation. It is accordingly suggested that having arrived at
                                    the categories to be manufactured, actual quantity limitations
                                    be set up.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>The next point which we wished to make in the telephone
                                    conversation is that it appears to the Department to be urgently
                                    desirable to reach an agreement as to internal consumption of
                                    raw rubber in Brazil at the earliest possible time. The Peruvian
                                    agreement provides for an actual number of tons which is to
                                    represent the total consumption of raw rubber in Peru. This
                                    figure, as has been stated, is based on the principle of
                                    equality of uses in the United States and Peru. The principle
                                    has, it is believed, been recognized by the United
                                    States-Brazilian agreement as to rubber, but it now remains to
                                    translate this general commitment into an actual tonnage. For
                                    the same reasons which motivate us to request an early agreement
                                    as to manufactured rubber, we urge that an early settlement be
                                    made of the actual amounts of raw rubber to be reserved for
                                    internal consumption in Brazil. We also think it advisable for
                                    you to discuss with appropriate Brazilian officials the adoption
                                    of a rationing scheme which would make tires available only for
                                    essential uses.</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>As explained to you by telephone, the reason for the
                                    Department’s sense of urgency in the above matters is the fact
                                    that there have been reports of various attempts to make forward
                                    contracts as to both raw and manufactured rubber with the
                                    Brazilian producers and manufacturers. The Department desires to
                                    prevent the creation of such agreements which might constitute
                                        <hi rend="italic">fails accomplis</hi> which would interfere
                                    with the application of the principles above referred to.</item>
                                <label>7.</label>
                                <item>We realize the necessity, which you referred to during the
                                    telephone conversation, of trying to agree upon figures for the
                                    requirements of the other American republics from Brazil so that
                                    any restrictions which might be reached in your negotiations
                                    could be agreed upon by Brazil after consultation and in
                                    agreement with the other American republics. The Department has
                                    attempted to get these figures as to both amount and types of
                                    raw and manufactured rubber, but as yet has not had much
                                    success. The Department will, however, attempt to obtain these
                                    figures for you and obtain agreements where possible.</item>

                        <p>1164. Your 1442 of April 28<note n="49" xml:id="d664fn49">Not
                                printed.</note> and 1486 of May 1. For Donnelly and Allen. All here
                            concur in feeling that you have obtained excellent results in your
                            negotiations with respect to internal consumption and manufactured
                            products.</p>
                        <p>The agreement outlined in your 1486 of May 1 is in general
                            satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>Under points 2 and 3 it is understood that Rubber Reserve purchases the
                            exportable surplus of tires and tubes and then uses them in supplying
                            essential Latin American requirements.</p>
                        <p>The wording of point 5 is not clear as it refers to the advisability that
                            the United States give earliest possible assurance to “these countries”
                            with respect to the supply of essential requirements. It is assumed that
                            you refer to other Latin American essential requirements for
                            miscellaneous rubber goods. In the agreement with Peru, this Government
                            agreed to collaborate with Peru with the view of assuring <pb n="702"
                                xml:id="pg_702" facs="0714"/>to Peru an equitable distribution of
                            supplies of rubber products available to United States and Peru on the
                            basis of relative needs and of the present emergency. It is probable
                            that similar assurances will be given to the other countries which have
                            broken with the Axis.</p>
                        <p>Following is estimated use of miscellaneous rubber products in long tons
                            of crude rubber content during 1940: Argentina 145; Bolivia 30; Chile
                            195; Colombia 126; Ecuador 21; Panama 36; Paraguay 3; Peru 58; Uruguay
                            29; Venezuela 147.</p>
                        <p>Following is estimate of 1942 requirements for essential needs of
                            miscellaneous rubber products in long tons of crude rubber content:
                            Argentina 50; Bolivia 38; Chile 158; Colombia 76; Ecuador 6; Panama 12;
                            Paraguay 6; Peru 59; Uruguay 27; Venezuela 82. No breakdown of products
                            is available at present time.</p>
                        <p>The estimate of Argentina’s requirements is recognized as low, but it is
                            felt that with strict limitation in Argentina there is sufficient rubber
                            in stock to care for requirements for rest of year, except for a small
                            allocation to cover special types of products.</p>
                        <p>These figures represent only present intention here and it should not be
                            implied that this country is to be bound to supply such amounts to these
                            other countries.</p>
                        <p>The answer to the question under point 7 depends on the product for which
                            the reclaim is to be used. Goodyear and Firestone have been asked to
                            furnish additional information on this question and it will be
                            transmitted on receipt.</p>
                        <p>With respect to points 9 and 10, the United States will agree to do
                            everything possible to facilitate these shipments so far as consistent
                            with the relative emergency needs of the two countries.</p>

                            and not used as a credit against the 5–milliondollar fund.</p>
                        <p>We had understood that the premiums as due would be credited against any
                            part of the 5-million-dollar fund which had been used in Brazil for the
                            purpose of increasing rubber production until that part of the
                            5-million-dollar fund so used had been covered after which any such
                            premium would then be paid outright to the appropriate Brazilian

                            these items should be produced in accordance with W.P.B. specifications
                            as set forth in order M–15–b, as amended.</p>
                        <p>The agreement with Rubber Reserve should provide that Rubber Reserve
                            Company is entitled to change the items on the list and specifications
                            therefor with due protection to the interests of the manufacturer.
                            Rubber Reserve will make the necessary arrangements to finance the
                            acquisition of these items and their storage in Brazil. It is understood
                            that this offer applies only to those manufactured goods produced within
                            the quota fixed by agreement for Brazil’s domestic industrial
                            consumption of crude and reclaimed rubber.</p>
                        <p>The agreement is not limited to the acquisition of essential products.
                            This is for two reasons. In the first place we do not have here detailed
                            information as to Brazilian production facilities for miscellaneous
                            products, and hence cannot determine to what extent it would be feasible
                            to manufacture items regarded here as essential. Second, we do not have
                            detailed information as to the requirements of the other Latin American
                            Republics for miscellaneous products. For these reasons Rubber Reserve
                            Company is planning to send to Brazil in the very near future a
                            representative familiar with conservation policies here who will aid in
                            changing over to the manufacture of essential items, and we can proceed
                            with the obtaining of the necessary information for the other Latin
                            American Republics. In the meantime, however, Rubber Reserve Company
                            desires to acquire all manufactured products not required for domestic
                            consumption in Brazil.</p>

                        <p>The fund is primarily available for subsidies without obligation of
                            repayment. Included in such subsidies, per the terms of paragraph 4 of
                            the agreement of March 3, 1942, are premiums for raw rubber purchased by
                            the Rubber Reserve Company. These premiums are to be credited against
                            the fund and turned over to the Brazilian Government to be expended by
                            that Government for raw rubber development projects.</p>
                        <p>Where a request is made for a subsidy from the fund the governing
                            consideration should be the importance of the project for which the
                            subsidy is requested to expeditious production of raw rubber. Subject to
                            this consideration, however, the following may also be taken into
                            account: (1) Whether the project is commercially feasible on a profit
                            basis without subsidy or with only partial subsidy; (2) If it is,
                            whether there is assurance that it will be undertaken at the earliest
                            possible moment regardless of a subsidy.</p>
                        <p>The fund is also available for loans. As in the case of subsidies, the
                            governing consideration in passing upon a request for a loan is the
                            importance of the project for which the loan is sought to expeditious
                            production of raw rubber. Subject to this consideration, however, the
                            following may also be taken into account: (1) Whether the project is
                            such as is financed by loans according to the usual practice of the
                            industry; (2) Whether the project is a sound risk according to ordinary
                            standards of banking practice; (3) If it is a sound risk whether there
                            is assurance that it will be financed by private sources of capital at
                            the earliest possible moment. The amount of loans granted should be
                            deducted from the fund in the same manner as subsidies in order to
                            determine the balance on hand at any particular given time; but moneys
                            received in repayment of the principal of such loans immediately should
                            be returned to the fund and become available for re-expenditure.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that in so far as possible requests for loans to finance
                            projects which are commercially sound be granted from special funds to
                            be set up by the Rubber Reserve Company. This would prevent undue
                            depletion of the 5 million dollar fund which may be used to finance any
                            project necessary to expedite raw rubber production regardless of how
                            bad a commercial risk the project may be.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with what has been said previously with respect to granting
                            subsidies from the fund, and for more specific guidance with respect to
                            the same, the following are suggested as illustrative of projects
                            meritorious of subsidy: This list is merely illustrative and is by no
                            means to be considered as exhaustive.</p>

                        <p>With respect to arrangements heretofore proposed, on the basis of the
                            foregoing the following treatment would be accorded. The supplies
                            referred to in your 1484 of May 1<note n="58" xml:id="d668fn58">Not
                                printed.</note> appear to be commercially profitable and only a
                            financing problem is involved. The 500,000 dollar fund made available
                            for that purpose will accordingly be restored to the fund to the extent
                            repaid. On the other hand, the credit of $50,000 opened to build
                            barracks and pay transportation does not appear to be a commercial
                            undertaking and hence would be paid for out of the fund and reduce the
                            amount thereafter to be available. The $500,000 made available for
                            special loans pursuant to Department’s 1269 of May 18<note n="58"
                                xml:id="d668fn59">Not printed.</note> would be on the same basis as
                            the $500,000 made available for financing the purchase of supplies. The
                            expenditures of $50,000 each for projects approved by McAshan in
                            Department’s 1365 of May 27<note n="58" xml:id="d668fn60">Not

                            and hence paid for outright and finally from the fund.</p>

                        <p>2480. For Finletter and Allen, Rubber Reserve. Presidential decree law of
                            July 9 created Banco de Credito da Borracha with capital of 50,000
                            contos of which Brazilian Government will subscribe 55%, Rubber Reserve
                            40% and Brazilian public 5%. The three directors will consist of two
                            Brazilians and one American. Brazilian Government has approved
                            appointment E. E. Longas, American director, but has not yet named its
                            directors, one of which will be president of bank.</p>
                        <p>Proportionate stock ownership was changed without our knowledge from the
                            original agreement of 50–50 participation. Bouças explains that new
                            setup is necessary under corporation law requirements of Brazil.
                            Brazilian authorities have assured us that no loans, commitments or
                            undertakings will be concluded without written approval of American
                            director. This is the first time under existing banking legislation that
                            Brazil has permitted foreign stockholders and director and as such
                            represents important concession to United States and is so interpreted
                            here.</p>
                        <p>If we had been consulted in advance we would have approved the change in
                            proportionate stock ownerships. We regard the decrees and statutes of
                            the bank as satisfactory and feel that the measures will greatly
                            facilitate financing of entire rubber program.</p>

                            tubes for shipment from Brazil to American countries other than the
                            United States be not purchased by Rubber Reserve but be sold and shipped
                            by Brazil to <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0720"/>such countries
                            under an agreement between Brazil and Rubber Reserve whereby Brazil
                            would agree that shipments of tires and tubes from Brazil to each such
                            country would not exceed the quota established by the United States for
                            the essential needs of each such country.</p>
                        <p>The reason for this request by Brazil is that Brazil desires to retain
                            its normal trade relations with the countries concerned and does not
                            wish to appear to have such trade under the direct control of the United
                            States. In this connection the Brazilian Foreign Office has sent a
                            strong note to the Embassy expressing this point of view and taking the
                            position that the rubber agreement between Brazil and the United States
                            only contemplated that Brazil would sell the United States its
                            exportable surplus of crude and manufactured rubber to fill the needs of
                            the United States but not for redistribution by the United States to
                            other American countries. Brazilian Government feels so strongly on this
                            matter that they withheld export permits covering shipment of tires to
                            Peru now in process of loading but we were able to have them agree to
                            issue the licenses upon the understanding that this whole question would
                            be explored with a view to considering an adjustment of the present
                            arrangements for the purchase of tires and tubes in Brazil by Rubber
                            Reserve for distribution to other American countries.</p>
                        <p>The agreement with Brazil limiting consumption of crude rubber within
                            Brazil and the relating agreement to purchase tires and tubes is set
                            forth in Allen’s letter to Bouças originally dated April 27, 1942, later

                            and was agreed to by Brazil despite the specific provisions of the
                            rubber agreement between Brazil and the United States which contemplated
                            the expansion of rubber manufacture in Brazil. In view of this situation
                            it is important that the United States avoid any appearance of dictation
                            or arbitrary control and as long as Brazil specifically agrees to keep
                            its sales and shipments of tires and tubes to other American countries
                            within the quotas established by the United States the main purpose of
                            the <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0721"/>United States is
                            accomplished. Furthermore, the request of Brazil is in our opinion, in
                            accord with the understanding set forth in the memorandum of principles
                            agreed upon by Rubber Reserve and Brazil which was the foundation for
                            the agreement set forth in Allen’s letter to Bouças.</p>
                        <p>If the request of the Brazilian authorities is granted it should be made
                            clear that it is without prejudice to our rights under paragraph 7 of

                        <p>In any case we will attempt to negotiate early next week an agreement

                            first before new production is exported. We will also endeavor to
                            arrange for the continuance of the system whereby we purchase all tires
                            and resell to foreign or Brazilian buyers for exportation since Mr.
                            Cooke has informed us that Brazil’s production is approximately
                            equivalent to total requirements of other Western Hemisphere Republics.
                            To facilitate these discussions please cable third quarter allocations
                            each Western Hemisphere Republic so far arranged and prospects arranging

                            of the entire consumption agreement. [Allen, McAshan, Micou.]</p>

                        <p>2251. Your despatch 8073, July 31,<note n="66" xml:id="d671fn66">Not

                                printed.</note> There are certain distinct and important advantages
                            which the present arrangements on Brazilian manufactured products afford
                            to Brazil. In the first place, Brazil is assured a market for these
                            products for the term of the contract at a price fixed by Brazil. Under
                            the arrangements now in effect Rubber Reserve has purchased almost 3
                            million dollars worth of Brazilian tires. Rubber Reserve pays cash
                            immediately. The manufacturer does not have to wait for shipping to be
                            available before getting his money. Rubber Reserve buys the tires and
                            puts them in warehouses and pays the warehouse charges, an arrangement
                            which permits normal operations by the manufacturers unaffected by the
                            shipping situation. <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0722"/>The
                            manufacturers in turn are able to keep their workers steadily employed.
                            They are assured a guaranteed market for 5 years, at a time when
                            Brazil’s consumption of tires has been tremendously reduced and when
                            demand in the other countries cannot be considered assured. It seems to
                            us unlikely that Brazil could obtain similar undertakings from other
                            sources.</p>
                        <p>It should also be kept in mind that this Government is supplying to the
                            manufacturers various materials required in tire manufacture, such as
                            bead wire, which Brazil cannot obtain elsewhere. This Government is also
                            giving sympathetic consideration to the application by the Goodyear
                            Company of Brazil to export machinery for manufacturing rubber
                            belting.</p>
                        <p>Acting in reliance on the arrangements worked out by Allen, and complied
                            with in practice by the Brazilian authorities, Rubber Reserve has made
                            commitments to furnish tires in specific amounts to Colombia, Peru and
                            others. This Government also gave undertakings to all the other American
                            Republics to supply their indispensable requirements for tires. See the
                            Department’s circular telegram of May 18.<note n="68" xml:id="d671fn68"
                                >Printed in vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">vi</hi>, section under
                                Colombia entitled “Negotiation of an agreement between the Rubber
                                Reserve Company and Colombia for the purchase of Colombia’s
                                exportable surplus of rubber,”</note> These undertakings were
                            entered into at the urgent request of the Brazilian Government, and it
                            was assumed the exportable surplus of Brazilian tires would be available
                            to fill them. Even if the understanding set forth in Allen’s letter of
                            May 2<note n="69" xml:id="d671fn69">See footnote 63, <ref

                            acknowledged, there can be no ambiguity about the meaning of paragraph 7
                            of the March 3 agreement, which Bouças advised had been cleared by
                            telephone with President Vargas. Moreover, the second paragraph of
                            Allen’s memorandum handed to Souza Costa, Bouças and Truda on April
                                28<note n="70" xml:id="d671fn70">Not found in Department
                                files.</note> leaves no doubt as to the intentions and understanding
                            of this Government in making the arrangements proposed to Brazil.</p>
                        <p>Aside from the advantages of the present system to Brazil and without
                            regard to its contractual status, the following considerations appear to
                            us to make the abandonment of the present system inadvisable.</p>
                        <p>1. This Government has no desire to limit or interfere with Brazil’s
                            trade relations with the other American Republics, or to obtain control
                            of any of those relations as such.</p>
                        <p>2. There is a limited and small amount of rubber products available for
                            the indispensable needs of the American Republics. It is urgently
                            necessary that the distribution of available supplies should be made
                            equitably and based upon the essential wartime requirements of the
                            countries.</p>
                        <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0723"/>
                        <p>3. The Brazilian Government will appreciate that an equitable
                            distribution can be attained only through the exercise of adequate
                            controls. A particular purchaser should not get a disproportionate
                            number of tires. Information as to sizes and types must be considered in
                            each case to determine whether the order is justified. Sales should not
                            be made to undesirable purchasers. Shipments should be arranged so as to
                            coordinate available shipping space with consumption needs. Supplies
                            should be integrated so as to make a pool available to meet orders for
                            various sizes and types. Otherwise there will be inefficiency in filling
                            orders. Rubber Reserve is prepared to create that pool and to maintain
                            balanced inventories.</p>
                        <p>4. It has taken this Government 2 years to establish adequate controls
                            for exports from this country. Operation under the control machinery is
                            understood and accepted by the various importing countries.</p>
                        <p>5. The establishment of quotas for exports from Brazil without further
                            implementation is not sufficient. It is extremely doubtful whether
                            Brazil would strictly uphold the quota system under the stress of
                            diplomatic or internal political pressure. In any event certain
                            requirements for tires and other rubber products must be furnished from
                            this country (including, in the case of Brazil, tires for airplanes and
                            other equipment for the Brazilian armed forces) because they cannot be
                            manufactured in Brazil. Information as to shipments from Brazil and the
                            United States must be coordinated so as to be available in passing on
                            any particular shipment from either country.</p>
                        <p>6. The contract now being negotiated with Mexico<note n="71"
                                xml:id="d671fn71">For correspondence concerning these negotiations,
                                see <ref target="frus1942v06">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >vi</hi></ref>, section under Mexico entitled “Agreement between
                                the Rubber Reserve Company and Mexico …”</note> contemplates that
                            Mexico will sell to the United States its exportable surplus of
                            manufactured products. Venezuela might conceivably become an exporter of
                            tires. It is therefore quite clear that some single entity must
                            administer the distribution of tires available for export from this
                            country, Brazil, Mexico and any other exporting country.</p>
                        <p>7. A control system might be established in the Embassy, but this would
                            result in duplication of personnel and in almost endless checking back
                            and forth between the Embassy and the agencies here.</p>
                        <p>8. As a theoretical matter the administrative entity might best be an
                            inter-American commission. It appears to us hopeless to expect that such
                            a commission could function efficiently at any time in the near future.
                            This Government is prepared to consider the establishment of such an
                            agency if it is considered necessary. Until it is established, however,
                            the disposition of tires from Brazil should remain subject to
                            supervision by this Government, which is the only entity now in a
                            position to provide that supervision.</p>
                        <p>9. The substance of the present arrangement is this: The Government of
                            the country to which the tires are to be shipped issues a certificate of
                            necessity to an importer in that country. The importer in turn forwards
                            the certificate together with his order to an exporter either in Brazil
                            or in this country. The exporter forwards an export application to the
                            Office of Exports Control of the Board of Economic Warfare and if the
                            order is approved Rubber Reserve sells the tires to the exporter who
                            carries out the transaction with the importer. <pb n="712"
                                xml:id="pg_712" facs="0724"/>The exporter thus has all the contacts
                            with the importer in the normal commercial manner, the transaction
                            merely being subject to approval of the export here not with respect to
                            its business aspects but for the purpose of maintaining an equitable
                            distribution of a scarce material.</p>
                        <p>You will note that orders can be placed either with Brazilian exporters
                            or exporters in this country. The latter were included because importers
                            of tires in the consuming countries were accustomed to deal with
                            exporters in this country and Brazil has not heretofore been an exporter
                            of tires. This latter fact of course means that it is not accurate for
                            Brazil to talk about maintaining normal trade relations. Brazil actually
                            wants to build up new relations; this Government naturally has no
                            opposition to this objective. If agreement to continued purchase and
                            distribution of Brazilian tires by Rubber Reserve could be achieved
                            through exclusion of exporters in this country, that would not be an
                            insurmountable obstacle providing orders already placed and accepted by
                            Rubber Reserve from exporters in this country are executed.</p>
                        <p>If it would be more satisfactory to the Brazilian Government to have the
                            application filed with the Rubber Reserve office in Rio de Janeiro, that
                            would be entirely acceptable here. Of course in that event the
                            application would be forwarded to the Board of Economic Warfare here for
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>Rubber Reserve would also be entirely agreeable to making available to
                            the appropriate Brazilian agencies information as to orders received,
                            shipments made, etc.</p>
                        <p>10. In order to avoid implications of the kind referred to in paragraph 9
                            of the note from the Foreign Office of July 25, 1942,<note n="72"
                                xml:id="d671fn72">Not printed.</note> Brazil might notify the other
                            Republics that the Governments of Brazil and of the United States have
                            agreed that there would be available, in Brazil or in the United States,
                            a specified quota for the next quarter and that such quotas might be
                            obtained by following the procedure referred to above. In this way
                            Brazil would get credit for supplying the needs and at the same time the
                            orders would be subjected to the controls regarded here as necessary.
                            Quotas for the next quarter have been sent with Rubber Reserve’s letter
                            of August 1 to McAshan.</p>
                        <p>11. The substance of the foregoing is that it is desirable to continue
                            the present arrangements, possibly excluding exporters in this country
                            from the procedure and possibly providing for the filing of applications
                            with the Rubber Reserve office in Rio. It is felt here that a change to
                            a quota system administered by Brazil will result in a complete
                            breakdown in the conservation program now well under way in the other
                            American Republics.</p>
                        <p>Please inform McAshan and Micou of foregoing. It is concurred in by
                            Ambassador Caffery, Donnelly, Rubber Reserve and Board of Economic
                            Warfare.</p>

                            telegrams 3069, August 15, 3166, August 20. Following are conclusions
                            after further discussions by Department, Board of Economic Warfare,
                            Rubber Reserve and Donnelly, for which please try to secure Brazilian
                            acceptance.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1st. If Brazilian tires are to be distributed equitably and on
                                basis of indispensable needs, agreement on all transactions should
                                be obtained from Washington. It is suggested that applications and
                                orders be presented by the Commission for the control of the
                                Washington Agreements to Rubber Reserve, Rio de Janeiro. The latter
                                can then informally advise Rubber Reserve, Washington, by telegraph
                                or otherwise, of facts necessary for passing judgment. The agreement
                                between the two Governments need not, of course, refer to anything
                                except approval by Rubber Reserve, Rio de Janeiro. It is believed
                                here that, through special arrangements with Board of Economic
                                Warfare, each transaction could be processed here within 48 hours
                                after receipt. The reason for this procedure is that there is
                                believed to be only insufficient information in Rio de Janeiro for
                                adequate consideration of the applications to be expected. It does
                                not have the names of people on the Proclaimed List in the other
                                countries; this list changes from day to day. It is not in a
                                position to pass on the importance of particular projects for which
                                tires may be needed; Washington has detailed information as to the
                                purpose and status of these projects.</item>
                            <item>2d. Washington should have the right to approve and if need be to
                                direct allocations. It has made commitments to the other American
                                Republics. A general commitment was made in the Department’s
                                circular telegram of May 18,<note n="78" xml:id="d674fn78">Printed

                                addition this Government has agreed with certain of the countries to
                                furnish specific numbers of tires. In the agreement with Colombia,
                                for instance, this Government undertook to supply 20,000 tires
                                immediately and 30,000 tires within a year. Emergency allocations
                                were made to Peru, Chile and the Dominican Republic in specific
                                amounts. In making these allocations this Government relied on the
                                availability of Brazilian tires. What happens if the disposition of
                                Brazilian tires is not in accord with our commitments?</item>

                                        Washington between Brazil and the United States, by which
                                        the American Government agreed to acquire from Brazil all of
                                        the exportable surplus of crude and manufactured rubber, and

                                        Governments of Brazil and the United States resolve to
                                        establish, by mutual agreement, a system for determining the

                                        using the statistical services which it has at its disposal
                                        to determine the requirements of the American Republics,
                                        relative to tires and tubes, will propose to Brazil the
                                        allocations which Brazil should supply to the other American

                        <p>2721. It is considered urgent here that immediate agreement be reached
                            with the Brazilian Government for the establishment of mutually
                            satisfactory prices for the purchase of rubber products by the United
                            States (presumably Rubber Reserve Company) as contemplated by paragraph
                            7 of the Rubber Agreement of March 3rd. Prices have been established for
                            the purchase of tires but we think we should now endeavor to establish
                            prices for other manufactured rubber products.</p>
                        <p>There has been correspondence between Korkegi<note n="82"
                                xml:id="d676fn82">Hani Jacob Korkegi, representative of the Rubber

                                facs="0730"/>the cooperation of the Brazilian Government in the
                            curtailment of the manufacture of nonessential rubber products but also
                            to assist in the conversion of existing facilities to the production of
                            essential rubber products. To this end Rubber Reserve stands ready to
                            purchase existing surplus stocks of manufactured rubber products held by
                            manufacturers and upon specific recommendations of the United States
                            Purchasing Commission in Brazil, and assuming that such curtailment can
                            be accomplished, Rubber Reserve will help in the conversion depending
                            upon the merit in each case.</p>
                        <p>Some system of control should be established by the Brazilian Government
                            to restrict so far as possible the manufacture of miscellaneous rubber
                            goods except tires and the possible prohibition of the manufacture of
                            nonessentials such as cut thread, toys and the like. It would seem
                            appropriate that the Brazilian Government exercise the suggested control
                            of the allocation of crude rubber to the manufacturers and that the
                            appropriate agency of this Government assist in such control by the
                            licensing of shipments of chemicals and supplies to such manufacturers
                            from this country.</p>
                        <p>That this matter is of great urgency is shown by Korkegi’s reports that
                            the manufacture of non-essential rubber products in Brazil is definitely
                            on the increase, as illustrated by an account of the increase of the
                            production of rubber thread in the case of one manufacturer from 800
                            kilograms to 1400 kilograms per day, and that the present exportable
                            surplus of rubber thread alone is estimated at 35 tons per month.</p>

                                    the Foreign Minister had made a very strong statement to the
                                    effect that strict conservation of tires would be instituted in
                                    Brazil and that in his opinion it is unwise to attempt to get a
                                    better arrangement on this point. In view of this and in view of
                                    the fact that the lack of petroleum has automatically reduced
                                    the use of tires in Brazil, it was decided to accept the
                                    proposal.</p>

                        <p>The other changes were accepted, and Donnelly was instructed, with the
                            concurrence of Rubber Reserve Company, Board of Economic Warfare and
                            myself on behalf of the Department, to proceed with the execution of the
                                agreement,<note n="87" xml:id="d677fn87">Copies of the exchange of
                                notes of October 3, 1942, between the American Ambassador in Brazil
                                and the Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs which constituted the
                                agreement were transmitted to the Department by the Ambassador in
                                his despatch No. 8678, October 7, 1942, not printed. According to
                                its terms the United States was to determine the allocation of tires
                                and tubes for the other American Republics, and Brazil was to
                                determine the portion she could supply and communicate the
                                allocations to the other American Republics. The normal channels of
                                trade were to be employed. In addition this agreement embodied a
                                ratified form of agreement reached on April 30. According to the
                                latter the essential requirements of Brazil, the United States, and
                                the American Republics were to be provided by a reserve of 10,000
                                tons of crude rubber of which Brazil was entitled to 75% and from
                                which Brazil was also entitled to acquire the quotas of the other
                                American Republics for export to them. The Rubber Reserve Company
                                was to purchase all tubes and tires not essential for internal
                                consumption in Brazil. Brazil agreed to discontinue the manufacture
                                of non-essential products. The United States was not to export to
                                Brazil’s neighbors. Efforts were to be made by Brazil to make
                                extensive use of re-claimed rubber and by the United States to
                                supply essential materials for the rubber manufacturers, (811.20

                        <p>The resentment in the other American republics arises from the delay in
                            shipping the agreed allocations; this delay is caused solely by the
                            protracted negotiations and delays in Rio. Argentina has offered
                            gleefully to enter agreements to supply tires to Ecuador, etc. in case
                            we fail to fulfill our obligations.</p>
                        <p>The Department understands that the Uruguayan case may be a special one,

                            have specific information from you whether the Brazilian resentment is
                            against the several bilateral tire allocation agreements, mentioned
                            above; or whether you are recommending at the insistence of the
                            Brazilian Government to scrap and negotiate again the agreement in the
                            exchange of notes of October 3, 1942 (enclosures 4 and 8 of your

                            Venezuelan Ambassador called yesterday to say he had received a telegram
                            from the President of Venezuela instructing him to arrange for the
                            immediate shipment of tires and tubes to Venezuela. The Ambassador was

                            for his country for the fourth quarter and inquired if this was correct.
                            I told him that one of my experts would call on him to explain the
                            situation.</p>

                        <p>The tire and tube situation here is unsatisfactory. It is evident that
                            unless we can assure the Foreign Office that each American country has
                            agreed to the allocation and that it is not unilateral action on our
                            part, the Foreign Office will be under constant pressure from
                            representatives of American Republics here and will not be in a position
                            to justify the allocations. This may lead to the repudiation of the
                            agreement to the extent that the Brazilian Government will authorize the
                            exportation of tires and tubes to other countries independent of the
                            allocations.</p>

                            allocations of tires and tubes to a number of countries had either been
                            reached by agreement or in the case of certain countries with whom the
                            United States has rubber agreements, the allocation represented the
                            amount stimulated [<hi rend="italic">stipulated</hi>] in such agreement
                            to cover internal consumption. If such is the case it is amply apparent
                            from statements made by the Ambassadors of these countries in Brazil
                            that neither they nor their Governments understand the situation.</p>
                        <p>Aside from its effects on Brazil, it would seem desirable that the United
                            States endeavor to arrive at allocations by consultation and agreement
                            with each country.</p>
                        <p>Aranha has instructed the Commission for Control of Washington Agreements
                            to “insist with the American authorities here” that Uruguay and

                        <p>4784. My telegram No. 2237, June 26, 4 p.m.<note n="96" xml:id="d681fn96"
                                >Not printed.</note> Souza Costa told me yesterday that Aranha is
                            determined to ship the 600 tons of crude rubber to Chile which he
                            promised the Chilean Government during the Pan-American Conference here
                            in January and which he alleges was approved by our Government; also
                            that the Chilean Embassy here has already acquired 90 tons for prompt
                            shipment to Chile. Costa said he had strongly opposed the proposed sale
                            of the rubber <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0735"/>to Chile on the
                            ground that it violated the rubber agreement with the United States, but
                            that Aranha has taken the position that it is an agreement between two
                            governments and that he as Minister of Foreign Affairs committed the
                            Brazilian Government and that therefore Costa as Minister of Finance has
                            nothing to do with it.</p>
                        <p>Aranha told Souza Costa that he would resign rather than to break his
                            agreement with Chilean Government. We are reliably informed that the
                            Chileans have had no success in buying additional crude rubber in Brazil
                            and that Aranha is so aroused he might even compel firms to meet the
                            requirements of Chile. Allen and I have reviewed the situation and feel
                            that we should obtain factual information regarding the crude rubber
                            requirements of Chile and recent purchases of crude rubber by Chile from
                            Bolivia and other countries. If we can clearly establish that Chile’s
                            requirements of crude rubber taking into consideration the consumption
                            of manufacturing equipment now available there does not exceed 100 tons
                            annually which is Allen’s recollection, we could use this point most
                            effectively in our discussion with Aranha and follow up with the obvious
                            observation that the excess of 500 tons might find its way into
                            Argentina or be exchanged for Argentine tires and tubes or other
                            essential products. It would assist if we could assure Aranha that Chile
                            has been given a specific assurance that their essential requirements of
                            tires and tubes will be supplied from the United States or Brazil. These
                            points could be used to supplement our basic contention that in the
                            absence of any specific exception in the basic rubber agreement of March
                            3, 1942, that any outstanding commitments on that date on the part of
                            Brazil were nullified.</p>
                        <p>I have no recollection of the United States Government at any time giving
                            its express or implied approval to the reported transaction between
                            Brazil and Chile, but I would like to have the Department’s specific
                            assurance in this regard.</p>

                        <p>3672. Embassy’s 4784, November 16. Chile’s stocks crude rubber recently
                            estimated 400 to 500 tons. Pre-war normal consumption was approximately
                            400 tons per year including many nonessential items production of which
                            is no longer permitted in this country and is discouraged in Brazil. It
                            is estimated here that Chile’s requirements crude rubber for essentials
                            do not exceed 200 tons per year including 35 tons for retreading. Chile
                            is not to receive machinery from this <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724"
                                facs="0736"/>country for manufacture of tires. Department is
                            telegraphing Santiago to check Washington’s requirement estimates and
                            details of Chile’s recent imports. This information will be telegraphed
                            to you. In any case, it would be deplorable were Chile to receive
                            additional 600 tons from Brazil, an excess which no doubt would be
                            re-exported to Argentina as evidenced by a pending transaction in which
                            Corporación de Fomento, Chile, is to supply crude rubber to
                                Pirelli,<note n="98" xml:id="d682fn98">An industrial firm composed
                                of a considerable network of companies in several countries.</note>
                            Argentina and receive a return of 50 percent by weight in bicycle tires.
                            Assurance to supply Chile’s essential requirements conveyed to Chile in
                            Department’s circular telegram of May 18,<note n="99" xml:id="d682fn99"

                            emergency allocation available from Brazil, stating that orders placed
                            under this allocation would supersede orders previously placed in
                            Brazil. An attempt will be made to reach an understanding with Chilean
                            authorities regarding Chile’s rubber requirements and use this
                            understanding as basis for future allocations.</p>

                                <item>Immediately after the basic rubber agreement of March 3 with
                                    Brazil, the United States was compelled to purchase all of the
                                    existing stocks and future output of manufactured rubber from
                                    Brazil in order to prevent a big boom in Brazilian rubber
                                    maufacture and indiscriminate export to the other American
                                    republics. In the specific negotiations for this purchase and
                                    contract, it was agreed that exportable surpluses of tires,
                                    tubes, and miscellaneous rubber goods should be used (at least
                                    in part) for supplying the essential requirements for these
                                    items to the other American republics as agreed in the contracts
                                    made with other rubber producing countries in the hemisphere.

                                        <item>The careful consideration is strongly urged of the
                                            possibility of consulting the governments of the other
                                            American republics as to what they believe their
                                            essential rubber requirements are. These estimates and
                                            their justifications could then be examined in the light
                                            of the information available to the United States

                                            and altered or cut down accordingly. This procedure
                                            would, to my way of thinking, put us in a much firmer
                                            position as regards our justification for “dictating” to
                                            the other Americas what their needs are. They would then
                                            at least feel that they had had a chance to present
                                            their story. This, to me, seems most important.</item>

                            that the local representatives of the Rubber Reserve Company must follow

                        <p>122. Department’s 3672, November 24. Department has been advised by

                            Valparaiso December 13, consigned to Corporación de Fomento, shipped
                            from Santos, Brazil, November 17, by Arthur Dianna y Compañia

                        <p>The shipment referred to is in violation of the rubber agreement. As
                            indicated in Department’s 3672 it consists of rubber not needed by Chile
                            and at least part of which will probably reach Argentina in finished
                            form.</p>

                            violated the rubber agreement and protesting such violation, especially
                            when Chile has no justifiable need for the rubber and when Brazil and
                            this Government have undertaken to supply and are supplying Chile’s
                            needs for tires and other rubber products.</p>

                        <p>1464. The following is our tentative southbound shipping program to

                                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Coal</hi></p>
                                <p>The War Shipping Administration will attempt to provide space for
                                    50,000 tons of coal a month to Brazil. It will be incumbent upon
                                    Brazilian shipping to move an additional 25,000 tons a month.
                                    The Department estimates that this amount of coal from the
                                    United States will be adequate for Brazilian requirements if ore
                                    movement over Central do Brasil is reduced and if other
                                    economies are made in the use of coal. Your comments on this
                                    estimate would be appreciated. We shall also make efforts to
                                    have the British divert some coal shipments to Brazil.
                                    Deadweight tonnage available for coal from the United States for
                                    the present month is approximately 76,000.</p>

                                <p>Shipping available for other dry cargo to Brazil is approximately
                                    39,800 deadweight tons. Assuming that 75 percent of this figure
                                    represents cargo carrying capacity, the Department has suggested
                                    to the Maritime Commission that the resulting 30,000 tons be
                                    apportioned in the following manner: iron and steel, 25.8
                                    percent; tinplate, 10.0; newsprint, 13.3; wood pulp, 10.0;
                                    machinery, 4.1; copper and brass, 1.6; naval stores, 4.1;
                                    sulphur, 2.0; caustic soda and soda ash, 4.1; fertilizers, 3.7;
                                    other essentials, 21.3.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Your comments on the above would be appreciated and should be in the
                            Department not later than June 10. Should you differ substantially with
                            the Department’s estimates, corrective measures can be applied by the
                            W.S.A. during the remainder of the month. At the same time, please
                            indicate applicability of tonnage allocation and percentage distribution

                            interest to the Department, that the Canadian Trade Commissioner, Mr.
                            Glass, told me on June 23 that he had received a confidential telegram
                            from his government in Ottawa stating that six Lloyd Brasileiro ships
                            are now in southern United States ports and are refusing to accept
                            newsprint that is available for loading there because the freight rates
                            on newsprint are lower than on other cargo. Mr. Glass also said that
                            these ships are supposed to lift 600 tons of newsprint on each
                            voyage.</p>

                            relative essentiality of oil consuming services and the presently
                            critical tanker situation makes it imperative that oil transportation be

                                was not temporary and that domestic consumption of oil and gasoline
                                must be reduced (800.6363/775a).</note> you should state in addition
                            that this Government has in mind the importance to the war effort of
                            certain oil consuming activities in Brazil in addition to those already
                            included in the war essential category for which full oil supplies are
                            furnished. One example of such consideration on the part of this
                            Government is seen in Department’s telegram 1680, June 26, in which
                            assurance is given of intention to supply the full requirements of
                            petroleum products necessary for maximum production and transportation
                            of raw rubber. This Government is awaiting the arrival of General
                                Barbosa<note n="18" xml:id="d702fn18">Gen. Horta Barbosa, President

                            as war essential.</p>
                        <p>Despite these efforts on the part of this Government to alleviate the
                            burden which world wide tanker shortage has brought upon Brazil it <pb
                                n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0749"/>must be noted that the record
                            of gasoline consumption within Brazil during the first 4 months of this
                            year in comparison with consumption during the same period in 1941 does
                            not indicate that any effective measures were taken by the Brazilian
                            Government during the early part of this year to conserve this important
                            product. On the contrary the figures available to this Government show
                            that the use of gasoline during that 4 month period was 4.3 per cent
                            greater in 1942 than in 1941 instead of approximately 20 per cent less
                            as had been recommended by this Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department has observed with satisfaction that conservation measures
                            recently introduced have reversed this trend and the month of May shows
                            a substantial reduction in gasoline use although the first 5 months
                            total is still approximately the same as the corresponding total in
                            1941.</p>
                        <p>The Department is confident that the commendable program of conservation
                            indicated by the reduced consumption in May will be continued and
                            intensified in order that the civilian supplies during the remainder of
                            1942, at less than one half the 1941 rate, will not critically disturb
                            the national economy. In stating that no improvement in the oil
                            transportation situation is foreseen earlier than the end of this year
                            the Department does not magnify the seriousness of the tanker
                            shortage.</p>

                        <p>Aranha and Souza Costa are anxious to conclude the negotiations promptly

                            brief and general reference to the ships. They see in the commodity
                            program a means of strengthening their political positions which are
                            insecure as a result of the recent political developments here. I told
                            Aranha that I would inform Department regarding the publicity program.

                            suggest that it would be advisable in the interests of all concerned for
                            the Government of Brazil to take over the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Esmeralda</hi> as an immobilized vessel under the plan referred to
                            above.</p>
                        <p>The three vessels referred to above belong to one Vlasov, formerly a
                            Roumanian citizen and now an Argentine. For somewhat over a year now,
                            this Government and the British Government have been negotiating with
                            Vlasov and the Argentine Government with a view to placing these ships
                            in service. It appears that the British began negotiations with the
                            agents of Vlasov in the spring of 1941 for the use of the three ships.
                            An informal agreement was arrived at and Vlasov was permitted to
                            transfer his vessels from Roumanian to Panamanian registry. Thereafter
                            Vlasov acquired Argentine citizenship and registered the <hi
                                rend="italic">Tropicus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Esmeralda</hi> in
                            Argentina. On February 2, 1942 an arrangement was worked out whereby the
                            British would charter the <hi rend="italic">Omega</hi> and
                            Moore-McCormack’s Argentine subsidiary would charter the other two
                            vessels. This arrangement was satisfactory to the British, to this
                            Government, to the Argentine Embassy here, and apparently to the owner
                            of the vessels. The Argentine Government, however, refused to allow the
                            agreement to be carried out.</p>
                        <p>As you know, Vlasov is on the Proclaimed List and the Statutory List.
                            Information this Department has received from Lisbon indicates strongly
                            that Vlasov’s representative there is working for the Axis.</p>
                        <p>It should be pointed out also that the Department has been informed that
                            the British will consider the three ships mentioned as having reverted
                            to their former status as enemy ships unless the agreement referred to
                            is carried out. This Government will take no steps to alter this
                            position. Corbett has full information.</p>

                            to the critical shipping situation and to the fact that the average

                            the Department requests the Embassy’s comments on urging the curtailment
                            of the number of editions and size of newspapers by approximately 30 per
                            cent, limiting future monthly shipments to 2500 tons. It has been
                            reported that Brazilian newspapers have made no cut in the number of

                        <p>The new article 9, replacing article 8, is not satisfactory because of
                            its reference to new vessels. The War Shipping Administration is unable
                            to agree to give Brazil even a qualified right to new vessels as
                            replacements for old vessels which may be lost. They are unable to
                            understand why the Brazilian Government should not be satisfied with
                            replacement by vessels of similar tonnage, size, and characteristics, as
                            they will then be restored to their original position.</p>
                        <p>It is noted that the new article 9 would obligate the United States to
                            replace vessels listed in article 3 whether loss is caused by marine or

                            provided that it is definitely understood that we are concerned <pb

                            risks and not with ordinary damage from marine risks.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the suggested changes in article 1 of the bareboat
                            charter, the War Shipping Administration suggests that the term “way
                            ports” be changed to read “nearby ports” and omitting the term “between
                            the two countries”. This language would permit calls to Uruguayan ports
                            without making direct reference to such ports in the charter itself.</p>

                            constitutes the most difficult shipping problem with reference to the
                            American republics. The following tabulation shows the status of coal

                        </table>
                        <p>It will be recalled that the proposed schedule envisaged 20,000 tons a
                            month in Lloyd Brasileiro vessels and 50,000 tons in United
                            States-controlled and other vessels. The War Shipping Administration, as
                            you will note, is planning to make up in September most of its August
                            deficiency (11,000 tons of which actually sailed out on September 1 and
                            was included in the 62,000 ton figure cabled to you).</p>
                        <p>It is imperative that Lloyd Brasileiro carry its own part of the load if
                            the total shipping schedule of 70,000 tons of coal and 28,000 tons of
                            other cargo is to be met. Prospective sailings of Lloyd Brasileiro boats
                            in September and October are very few. This places the major part of the
                            burden on the United States shipping tonnage.</p>
                        <p>In this connection you might point out to the Brazilian authorities that
                            the Lloyd Brasileiro is always reluctant to carry low value cargo, such
                            as coal, newsprint, rails for the steel mill at Itabira, fire brick <pb
                                n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0754"/>(which, it refused utterly to
                            carry), and other similar materials going largely to official Brazilian
                            projects.</p>

                        <p>A–288. Reference is made to Department’s airgram A–241 of September 17 in
                            which reference was made to the fact that the Lloyd Brasileiro was
                            really not cooperating fully in the transportation of goods between the
                            United States and Brazil. The War Shipping Administration has recently
                            detailed for the Department some of its difficulties. These are: <quote

                                    <item>“1. There is an urgent need for better cooperation between
                                        the War Shipping Administration and Lloyd Brasileiro, with
                                        particular reference <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0755"
                                        />to the character of cargo lifted by the Brazilian and the
                                        American controlled vessels in this trade. There is a
                                        tendency on the part of the agents to await the assignment
                                        of American controlled vessels before disclosing information
                                        with respect to their own prospective sailings. The agents
                                        claim that they are unable to get the information from
                                        Brazil.</item>
                                    <item>2. There is a rather well-founded suspicion on our part
                                        that the Brazilians are interested in higher paying freight
                                        and that some of their apparent operating difficulties may
                                        spring from a desire to avoid handling undesirable cargo
                                        such as newsprint and coal.</item>
                                    <item>3. There is a definite need for the reaching of some
                                        understanding, with the Brazilians with respect to the
                                        number of vessels earmarked for trade between Brazil and the
                                        United States and some undertaking to continue to operate a
                                        minimum number of vessels in this trade.”</item>

                        <p>Of course, item 3 would be cleared up in part if the proposed ship deal
                            with the Brazilians is made. Even in this case, however, there is no
                            firm undertaking to put any more ships into the United States trade to
                            replace any which may be sunk. There continues a belief in Washington
                            that there are additional Brazilian vessels in non-essential trades or
                            not regularly operating which could be added to the Brazilian-United
                            States service.</p>
                        <p>The Department would appreciate your comments and requests that in your
                            discussions with the Brazilians on shipping matters that occasion be

                            p.m. Last June (Department’s 1464, June 8, 1 [<hi rend="italic">9</hi>]
                            p.m.) the Embassy informed the Brazilian Press Association that every
                            effort was being made to arrange for newsprint shipments at the rate of
                            3,500 tons a month, “the minimum Brazilian requirement”. The large cut
                            now contemplated would have an unfavorable reaction here. The Bank of
                            Brazil has requested as a rock bottom figure an allocation of 3,000 tons
                            of newsprint for October (my 3666, September 17<note n="31"

                            nonexistent. Shipments to Brazil from the first of the year to August 30
                            totaled only 13,468 tons an average of but 1,683 tons per month.
                            Shipments for the last 3 months of that period were critically low, viz:
                            171 tons in June, 341 in July and 951 in August.</p>
                        <p>Shipments of 3,500 tons per month for at least a few months would be
                            desirable so that reasonable minimum stocks could be built up; and it is
                            recommended that thereafter the figure should not be less than 3,000
                            tons per month.</p>

                        <p>With the Ambassador’s approval we had a long conference yesterday with
                            officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The subject of passenger
                            vessels and joint working out of mutual problems were discussed.
                            Brazilians fear that if more ships, particularly passenger, are turned
                            over to us they may find themselves in grave difficulties in coastwise
                            movement, particularly of troops, laborers and <pb n="746"
                                xml:id="pg_746" facs="0758"/>supplies to northern Brazil. We assured
                            them that if they give us the passenger ships some basis could be worked
                            out for meeting whatever current needs of the two countries might arise
                            thereafter. We suggested the prompt establishment of a joint
                            Brazilian-American shipping adjustment group to handle such matters. The
                            idea was well received. We feel that the establishment now of such a
                            group is a necessary requirement to cover the operations of the 23 ships
                            under article III of the agreement of September 30<note n="34"
                                xml:id="d717fn34">Not printed, but see footnote 29, <ref
                                    target="#pg_743">p. 743</ref>.</note> and also to take care of
                            the use of our vessels in local coastwise trade when needed by
                            Brazilians and when they would otherwise move in ballast as in the case
                            of the <hi rend="italic">Galveston</hi>, as well as to take care of
                            operations of any passenger and other vessels we might hereafter
                            acquire. At present no machinery is set up for operations under article
                            III and we believe we will not get passenger vessels except under
                            agreement to afford their use by Brazil when the need is shown.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry urged haste in disposition of <hi rend="italic"
                                >Itamaraty</hi>. We believe whatever we do with respect to this
                            vessel can be effectively used as a lever to acquire possibly passenger
                            and other vessels; therefore, please bear this fact in mind in replying
                            to this telegram. Please telegraph data relative to condition, the cost
                            of repairs and value of <hi rend="italic">Itamaraty</hi>.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the use of our vessels in Brazilian coastwise trade, we
                            believe every effort should be made by us to afford such use when
                            desired by Brazil, which will waive coastwise laws because the needs in
                            this trade, particularly in north Brazil, are interfering with our
                            obtaining more Brazilian tonnage.</p>
                        <p>We will meet with Aranha Friday afternoon, therefore please telegraph
                            reply to reach us not later than Friday morning. [Graham.]</p>

                            the passenger ship proposal. He said that the President had decided to
                            transfer to us without any restrictions or conditions, and not to be
                            returned to Brazil, four Lloyd passenger ships (the <pb n="747"

                                Bage, Raul Soares</hi>) provided we agree to supply rails and
                            accessories not rolling stock for the proposed railway line to connect
                            the Central do Brazil Railway at Montes Claros in the State of Minas
                            Geraes, with the Leste Railway at Contendas (Bom Jesus dos Meiras) in
                            the State of Bahia, a distance of approximately 500 kilometers. He said
                            that President Vargas and the General Staff of the Brazilian Army regard
                            the project as of vital importance as auxiliary land service for the
                            transport of troops, supplies, et cetera, and as a substitute for a
                            water route and that its completion would make possible an all-rail
                            service between central Brazil to a point north of Natal. He said that
                            President Vargas was unwilling to release more passenger ships at this
                            time owing to the need for the ships for the transportation of troops
                            and supplies along the Brazilian coast. He said that President Vargas
                            does not wish to consider the plan as commercial but as the mutual
                            effort of the two Governments to improve and facilitate inland and ocean
                            transportation for the defense of the Americas. We attempted several
                            times to ascertain the terms under which they would expect us to furnish
                            the rails but the reply was always the same, namely, Vargas does not
                            wish to consider it as a commercial proposition. It was evident,
                            however, that they expect us to supply the rails at our expense in
                            exchange for the complete and unrestricted transfer of the passenger
                            ships to us.</p>
                        <p>He expressed the hope that our Government would make a prompt
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Queiroz has instructed the Director of the Railway Department of the
                            Brazilian Government to furnish us with detailed information regarding
                            the railway project. Preliminary information obtained from Mr. West, the
                            railway expert Attached to the Embassy, indicates that the uncompleted
                            stretch is 600 and not 500 kilometers, that it would involve the
                            furnishing of approximately 50,000 tons of rails and accessories, also
                            that it would take 2 to 3 years to complete the job following the
                            arrival of the equipment in Brazil. Dr. Queiroz did not specify any time
                            element for delivery of the rails and did not make this a condition for
                            immediate release of the ships. The need for importation of the rails is
                            not immediate and will depend upon the construction of the roadbed.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the surveyors of the War Shipping Administration at
                            present in Rio would survey two of the passenger ships now here. This is
                            being commenced today. One of the other passenger ships is scheduled to
                            arrive here shortly from Europe and the fourth is en route to Buenos
                            Aires and will return in about 25 days.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Queiroz said he would appreciate my conveying President Vargas’
                            message to President Roosevelt and requesting an early reply. Detailed
                            information regarding the railway project will be telegraphed <pb

                                Surveyor.</note> War Shipping Administration:</p>
                        <p>At a meeting today between representatives of Lloyd Brasileiro, the
                            Embassy and the War Shipping Administration held for the purpose of
                            speeding up the turnover of the chartered vessels, it was concluded that
                            the most expeditious manner would be for us to take delivery of the
                            vessels in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Lloyd Brasileiro raised the point of the cost of repairs in the
                            United States to comply with article 5 of the Charter Party. Of the 13
                            vessels chartered: 1 has been delivered; 1 is about to be delivered; 2
                            are in very poor conditions, namely, the <hi rend="italic">Minas
                                Loide</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ceara Loide</hi>. The condition
                            of the last two vessels is such that considerable repairs would be
                            necessary here prior to the vessels’ departure in class; it was
                            tentatively agreed that these two vessels should remain here, the
                            requirements of article 5 of the Charter Party to be completed here
                            prior to delivery to us of these two vessels. Repair costs incidental to
                            article 5 for the three vessels which are en route to the United States
                            would be covered under the lump sum mentioned hereafter.</p>
                        <p>The remaining six vessels would be placed in safe condition here,
                            including dry docking, cleaning and painting the bottom and drawing the
                            tail shaft, all for the account of Lloyd Brasileiro inasmuch as these
                            vessels would be in the employ and under the direction of Lloyd
                            Brasileiro until delivered to us in United States.</p>
                        <p>It was suggested that the Brazilian Government would agree to lump-sum
                            payment of $150,000 for repairs to the nine vessels. From conditions
                            seen on the vessels available here, it is felt that this is a fair
                            estimate of costs in Brazil. The excess cost, which would be offset by
                            the much faster turnover. Lloyd Brasileiro would agree to dry dock,
                            clean bottom, draw tail shaft and place all vessels here and not yet
                            delivered in seaworthy condition for the voyage to the United States as
                            expeditiously as possible.</p>

                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ceara Loide</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Minas
                                Loide</hi>, two vessels which are not out of class and require major
                            repairs of boilers, decks, et cetera, and which from observations will
                            not be delivered to us for approximately 3 to 4 months, are to remain
                            here until this work is completed by Lloyd Brasileiro for their account.
                            The time and cost to prepare these vessels for a safe voyage would be
                            practically the same as required for a turnover to us, and these repairs
                            in the United States would be excessive.</p>
                        <p>The following is a breakdown of the 13 vessels: 1 has been delivered and
                            1 will be delivered shortly; 2 are being repaired in Rio; and there are
                            9 which it is felt can be delivered to us in a reasonable time, of which
                            3 are now en route to the United States.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Golaz Loide</hi> has been delivered to us, and the

                            within the next 10 days.</p>

                            United States for delivery there.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Vitoria Loide</hi> is sailing coastwise and should
                            not require much time upon her return here for the voyage to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pelotas Loide</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Norte
                                Loide</hi> have temporary certificates in British corporation.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Su Loide</hi> will require putting through class;
                            she is now out of class.</p>
                        <p>In each case the three last-named vessels can be given a temporary
                            certificate to proceed to United States and there undergo and complete
                            class requirements.</p>

                            consideration, that, if we are to have any despatch, that we agree to
                            accept a maximum lump-sum payment of $350,000 for all expenditures for
                            the nine vessels mentioned and additional expenditures incurred, with
                            the exception of those for the <hi rend="italic">Minas Loide</hi> and
                                <hi rend="italic">Ceara Loide</hi>, to be for our account.</p>
                        <p>Please telegraph your views of the proposal, particularly as Lloyd
                            Brasileiro have definitely informed us that due to lack of mechanics,
                            material and equipment, the delivery of the vessels to us here in
                            accordance with article 5 will be considerably delayed. [Rose.]</p>

                            that proposal is for the <hi rend="italic">Ceara Loide</hi> and <hi

                            the <hi rend="italic">Minas Loide, Ceara Loide</hi> for our account. We
                            do not understand why we should accept these costs which may run into
                            considerable amount as from your statement these vessels require major
                            repairing. It would appear from analysis of proposal that it would be
                            more fair and reasonable as well as more advantageous in our efforts to
                            speed delivery at [<hi rend="italic">if</hi>] Brazil’s proposal of
                            $150,000 for estimated repairs be expected [<hi rend="italic"
                                >accepted</hi>]. This we understand you to feel represents fairly
                            Brazil repair costs on the nine vessels mentioned with delivery in U. S.
                            and in accordance with contract Brazil to complete the <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>At a meeting Saturday with the Brazilian Maritime Commission, at which
                            Dr. Andrade Queiroz represented President Vargas, they offered to let us
                            have four ships but I told them I could not even submit a proposal to
                            Washington for less than five ships and after some discussion they
                            agreed to turn over to us the following vessels: <hi rend="italic">Pedro
                                II</hi>, oil burner; <hi rend="italic">Almirante Alexandrino</hi>,
                            oil burner; <hi rend="italic">Bage</hi>, coal; <hi rend="italic">Pedro
                                I</hi>, coal; <hi rend="italic">Siqueiro Campos</hi>, coal. Four of
                            the vessels are now in Rio de Janeiro and the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Almirante Alexandrino</hi> is in Manáos.</p>
                        <p>Rose will return to Rio de Janeiro November 22 from Uruguay and will be
                            available next week to survey the vessels, provided the proposal appeals
                            to the Department and the War Shipping Administration. The Maritime
                            Commission states that the <hi rend="italic">Bage</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">Pedro I</hi> can be converted into oil burners in the
                            United States within a few weeks.</p>
                        <p>President Vargas and other officials of the Government are concerned over
                            the increasing need for coastwise shipping for the transportation of
                            troops, foodstuffs and other supplies to the northeast (they are
                            transporting them now), and they assert that in ceding the five vessels
                            to us they will have reached the limit to which they can go without
                            prejudicing coastwise trade. The Maritime Commission referred to the
                            possibility of withdrawing 1 of the 23 ships included in the recent
                            agreement for coastwise service, but I told them that it would be
                            inadvisable to make any alterations in the agreement, and they finally
                            accepted our point of view.</p>
                        <p>Although they have never said so in so many words, it is obvious that
                            they will ask us to make available to them up to 40,000 tons of rails in
                            exchange for the 5 ships.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Andrade Queiroz has put off his vacation until November 25. If
                            possible, I would like to receive a reply from the Department before his
                            departure because if there is any chance of reaching an agreement in
                            principle, I might be able to arrange for the early release of the
                            ships.</p>

                        <p>3740. Your 4904, November 23. The vessels mentioned have been studied by
                            the War Shipping Administration and the War Department, and because of
                            their age and lack of speed, agencies mentioned do not believe that they
                            would be suitable for the purposes which they have in mind. As you
                            undoubtedly realize, the vessels are to be used as troop transports in
                            inter-island routes. Therefore, the question of their suitability for
                            ocean service is of no great significance.</p>
                        <p>Please impress upon the Brazilians that these vessels are urgently
                            required in the prosecution of the war.</p>
                        <p>As stated in Department’s 3591,<note n="44" xml:id="d722fn44">Not
                                printed.</note> in view of the Army’s interest, officials of the War
                            Production Board and the War Shipping Administration are prepared to
                            discuss arrangements for the production and transportation of up to
                            40,000 tons of rails. However, authorities here do not believe it
                            possible to enter into a discussion involving the production and
                            transportation of this amount of material unless the Brazilians are
                            prepared to turn over all six vessels. As previously stated, this
                            Government would much prefer to acquire these vessels either through
                            purchase or charter, in which case it would be interested in any part of
                            the six vessels which the Brazilian Government feels might be released
                            without prejudicing coastwise trade.</p>
                        <p>It is also the opinion of those here who are acquainted with Brazilian
                            shipping that the withdrawal of these vessels from Brazilian trade would
                            not seriously damage coastwise service if other Brazilian vessels were
                            efficiently used and allocated without regard to commercial aspects to
                            the most important Brazilian coastwise trades. The presentation of this
                            view is left to your discretion.</p>
                        <p>Please emphasize in your discussion of this matter with the Brazilians
                            that these vessels would represent a real contribution to our war effort
                            at a time when such a contribution is needed.</p>

                            us have the ITA ships. The President instructed Celestino last night to
                            discuss the plan with the Brazilian Maritime Commission and to request
                            them to consider the ships from the standpoint of BRT instead of as a
                            business proposition. The President inquired of Celestino as to the rail
                            project and emphasized the importance of Brazil receiving up to 40,000
                            tons within 1 year.</p>
                        <p>President Vargas instructed Celestino to delay his trip to the United
                            States in order to be present in Rio de Janeiro during the conversations
                            relating to the passenger ships. Celestino has canceled his reservations
                            for December 7 but hopes to depart for Washington before December
                            15.</p>

                        <p>Three shipments of newsprint have left during the last month, 1385 tons
                            on the <hi rend="italic">Sea Serpent</hi>, the steamer mentioned in
                            Department’s 3935, 247 tons on the <hi rend="italic">Anita</hi>, which
                            left on or about December 3, 1942, and 198 tons on the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Moormacrey</hi>, which left at the same time. However, nine ships
                            are scheduled to sail between now and January 3, 1943 carrying a total
                            of 3639 tons divided as follows: consigned to customers of Murray
                            Simonsen, 1385; Anglo Brasileira, 755; T. Janer, 1065; and
                            miscellaneous, 434. This constitutes a revision from the schedule
                            outlined in Department’s 3935 and includes newsprint from St. Maurice
                            Valley consigned to Anglo Brasileira, of which some is presumably for
                                <hi rend="italic">O Globo</hi>. Due to the critical shipping
                            situation and the curtailment of space, the Department instructed the
                            Embassy in telegram 2496, August 29, 1942 and 3083, October 14, 1942 to
                            submit a recommendation as to the distribution of 3500 tons for November
                            and December, 1942 and 3,000 tons thereafter to various consignees, and
                            the Embassy submitted recommendations in various telegrams, the last of
                            which, no. 4840, November 18, 1942, 8 p.m.,<note n="50"
                                xml:id="d725fn50">Not printed.</note> requesting distribution among
                            three consignees the total figure of which was altered in Embassy’s
                            4915, November 23, 1942.<note n="50" xml:id="d725fn51">Not
                                printed.</note> The Board of Economic Warfare has continued to
                            cooperate with the Department in approving applications for freight
                            space for newsprint in accordance with Embassy’s recommendations and to
                            certify the applications to the War Shipping Administration as eligible
                            for shipment. However, after the War Shipping Administration publishes
                            the list of approved applications for freight space as eligible for
                            shipment, it is then incumbent upon the shippers or the importers’
                            agents themselves to make the necessary contracts with the steamship
                            operators for the actual freight space on board vessels. (See
                            Comprehensive Export Control Schedule No. 10, page 118, paragraph 13.)
                            With respect to newsprint, the Embassy will note that newsprint was
                            placed under general license on October 9, 1942 and to ship newsprint
                            all that was required was an approved application for freight space.</p>
                        <p>Apparently, it is the Embassy’s impression that the Department actually
                            allocates shipping space, and this misapprehension has resulted in the
                            exchange of numerous telegrams and a great deal of <pb n="755"
                                xml:id="pg_755" facs="0767"/>confusion on the subject of newsprint
                            shipments. As stated above, the Department has nothing to do whatsoever
                            with the actual loading of ships. The Department merely attempts to
                            expedite the approval, by the appropriate agencies charged with
                            shipping, of the necessary applications for freight space. When these
                            applications for freight space are approved, it is then up to the
                            shippers or the agents of the importers to make the actual arrangements
                            with the steamship operators for the lifting of the cargo.</p>
                        <p>Sufficient newsprint has now been approved with an “A” shipping priority,
                            as an indirect result of the Department’s intervention, to take care of
                            the requirements of all consumers in accordance with the most recent
                            recommendation of the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>The Department realizes the serious situation as a result of irregular
                            shipments and has called this to the attention of the War Shipping
                            Administration.</p>

                            high officials, including Souza Costa, are opposing this: They say that
                            Brazil cannot spare those ships at this time. Aranha says that is true
                            but he is in favor of letting us have them anyway, as a distinctly war
                            measure.</p>
                        <p>Aranha is to discuss the whole matter this afternoon with the President
                            and especially what the President will ask from us if he definitely

                        <p>5568. Embassy’s telegram 5530, December 29. I have received the following
                            personal letter from Aranha: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In accordance with our last conversation I take pleasure in the
                                    hope of confirming to Your Excellency the statement that
                                    President Vargas—complying with the request made to him by
                                    President Roosevelt <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0768"/>and
                                    Your Excellency—has authorized me to communicate to Your
                                    Excellency that powers were granted to me to study and make
                                    delivery of the Brazilian ‘ITA’ boats which he decided to turn
                                    over to the American Government for urgent purposes.</p>
                                <p>Your Excellency, who has such a good knowledge of our
                                    necessities, can well appreciate the difficulties which will
                                    result to our shipping and trade with the north of Brazil from
                                    the loss of these six ships.</p>
                                <p>Another important point which is also known to Your Excellency is
                                    the question of the safety of northeastern Brazil. Brazil does
                                    not have complete means of communication by land for that
                                    region. The program designed and initiated by the Government to
                                    complete such a communication system with the city of Natal, Rio
                                    Grande do Norte, has suffered constant interruptions due to the
                                    lack of railway materials.</p>
                                <p>Not so much from the standpoint of compensation but to remedy
                                    such a great handicap—made even worse as Your Excellency will be
                                    the first to recognize by ceding the best ships of our already
                                    deficient Merchant Marine—I ask Your Excellency to submit to
                                    President Roosevelt for consideration a statement of the most
                                    urgent Brazilian necessities connected with the transportation
                                    problem: Construction of the following railway stretches:</p>
                                <p>[Here follows the remainder of Mr. Aranha’s letter which is a
                                    detailed description of the railway routes and the needed
                                    construction materials and equipment; also, one paragraph of the
                                    Ambassador’s comment on certain details.]</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Aranha has been very vague about the terms of the transaction.</p>
                        <p>He keeps on saying, “the ships are yours”, but he declines to give us
                            details, presumably because he prefers to await receipt of our offer.
                            However, he has requested me to find out the c.i.f. Brazilian port cost
                            of the rails and has also expressed the hope that our Government would
                            turn them over to his Government on the basis of Lend-Lease.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that the Department discuss the rail project with R. K. West
                            who may be reached through Ex-Im Bank.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows another passage dealing with materials and equipment.]</p>
                        <p>Of the six ITA ships, five are available and acceptable. The <hi

                            and although no definite policy was outlined, several important
                            agreements in connection with the Proclaimed List were reached.</p>

                            <item>The Embassy agreed that pending review by the Committee, mentioned
                                above, it would request the Department to suspend action on all
                                cases that have been recommended for inclusion in the Proclaimed
                                List, but which have not as yet been included in that list. The
                                Committee will review these cases, and either remedial or preventive
                                steps agreed upon by the Committee will be taken locally, or the
                                cases will be again recommended to the Department for inclusion in
                                the Proclaimed List. This procedure should prevent an unnecessary
                                increase in the size of the Proclaimed List, and at the same time
                                gives promise of a more direct approach to control of cloaking and
                                other objectionable activities.</item>

                                Embassy. It is evident that if the Brazilian authorities,
                                represented on the Committee, do not object to our recommending to
                                the Department that such cases should be included in the Proclaimed
                                List, it is a strong indication that these cases should be included,
                                and I urgently request that all cases so submitted be agreed to by

                            troublesome cases now included in it. I must urge, however, that the
                            Interdepartmental Committee, take immediate action on such cases that
                            will be submitted by the Embassy with the recommendation that they be

                            work with the Committee, and has informed London accordingly. It is
                            anticipated that hereafter, both Embassies will reach agreement on cases
                            before they are presented to the Committee for consideration, and that
                            henceforth, recommendation for inclusion in the respective lists will be

                                This matter, of great concern to our industries and commerce, must
                                be examined carefully. We do not know the sources of information
                                used by American authorities in compiling the Black List.
                                Unknowingly they may be acting on biased information arising from
                                rivalry and intrigue. Under the existing regime of full cooperation
                                with the United States of North America, it is desirable that we
                                understand each other in everything, including this matter, of
                                utmost importance to our development and expansion.” Does this mean
                                that President was not informed by Brazilian authorities about
                                consultative procedure? In your discretion please bring operation of
                                consultations to President’s attention and reassure him concerning
                                recent additions to list. Dr. Souza Costa is absent from Washington
                                now but we are endeavoring to arrange for thorough discussion of
                                situation with him March 10. Please report fully your interpretation
                                and evaluation of this development and current situation regarding
                                maintenance of strong Proclaimed List policy which in last analysis
                                is necessary if we are to be able to justify and be reasonably
                                successful here in our unending efforts to meet the essential
                                requirements of Brazil and the other American republics.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Ambassador</hi>: We have given a great
                            amount of thought to the developments and suggested procedures
                            concerning cooperation with the Brazilian authorities on Proclaimed List
                            matters set forth in despatch no. 6518 of February 14, 1942.</p>
                        <p>This entire question is of such importance that I want to bring to your
                            attention personally some of the considerations which we must reckon
                            with here. I have kept in close touch with the Proclaimed List work and
                            I am familiar with the difficult situation with which you and Mr.
                            Donnelly have had to contend in carrying out a strong Proclaimed List
                            policy in Brazil. In determining Proclaimed List policy here we have
                            started with the assumption that neither we nor Brazil can afford to
                            permit the Proclaimed List to be made a major issue between us. We have
                            adjusted our procedures and policies on several important instances to
                            meet this consideration. My present fear is <pb n="761" xml:id="pg_761"
                                facs="0773"/>not that we will not be able to make fair allowance in
                            the future for the exigencies of certain important cases but rather that
                            the Department’s, and in turn the Embassy’s, ability to keep the
                            situation in effective balance will be impaired here unless the handling
                            of these matters in Brazil is kept generally in harmony with the
                            underlying realities here.</p>
                        <p>These realities are summed up in the fact that under the President’s
                            proclamation of July 17, 1941<note n="66" xml:id="d730fn66">Department
                                of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, July 19, 1941, p.
                                42.</note> the maintenance of the Proclaimed List is vested in five
                            other departments and agencies in addition to this Department. This is
                            because the Proclaimed List is an instrument for administering controls
                            which are vested in other departments and agencies—export control in the
                            Board of Economic Warfare, priority and allocation control in the War
                            Production Board, freezing control in the Treasury, etc. The task has
                            been to find a common list which would free these controls as much as
                            possible from the restraints of separate political intelligence services
                            and permit the greatest freedom of commercial and financial transactions
                            with persons not on a single published list. At the time the list was
                            established trade had come almost to a standstill because no business
                            man here could find out whether a prospective customer would pass the
                            profusion of secret and separate lists.</p>
                        <p>In order to produce uniformity and simplicity of administration here, the
                            work of administering the Proclaimed List has been carried out through
                            the Department’s Division of World Trade Intelligence and an
                            interdepartmental committee. The committee passes on all cases proposed
                            for addition and deletion and as a practical matter the unanimous
                            agreement of all members must be achieved on each case, not merely
                            because the head of each of the interested agencies and departments must
                            sign the orders promulgating the supplements to the Proclaimed List, but
                            to maintain the authority of the list and prevent the establishment of a
                            host of supplementary lists beyond the Department’s control. In order to
                            maintain reasonably uniform listing standards and to prevent
                            ill-considered actions, the committee members have been under
                            instructions from their respective agencies to act only on
                            recommendations which are supported with adequate substantiating
                            information or reasons. While this has required education, both of the
                            committee and some reporting officers in the field, the fact is that the
                            committee has found no difficulty in taking speedy and unanimous action
                            on cases which were adequately reported. This has been true of both
                            additions and deletions. Experience to date has shown clearly that an
                            extremely careful policy on deletions is necessary if the list is to be
                            administered with fairness and effectiveness.</p>
                        <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0774"/>
                        <p>All this is by way of saying that the Department is not by any means a
                            “free agent” on these matters and that we must carry these other
                            independent departments and agencies with us. In fact, the actual
                            economic warfare licensing control powers are vested, as I have said,
                            not in the Department but in the other agencies. The Department has
                            sought and so far maintained—but not without a struggle—the primary
                            administrative responsibility for the preparation of the list. I am
                            confident that the best of the argument is with us in this matter, but
                            there can be no question that our retaining this control depends upon
                            the continued harmonious functioning of the interdepartmental mechanism
                            and on the Department’s ability and willingness to pursue a strong
                            Proclaimed List policy. Furthermore, the interdepartmental authority
                            affords the Department and the missions an essential element of
                            protection against the political pressures which might well result in
                            either emasculating the list or in seriously impairing the Department’s
                            effectiveness in other diplomatic affairs if it bore the onus of
                            resisting such pressures on its sole responsibility.</p>
                        <p>I have gone into this background at some length to bring out why it is
                            imperative that the consultative procedures which have been arranged
                            with the Brazilian authorities should be truly consultative and must
                            leave with the Proclaimed List Committee here the authority to take such
                            action as seems necessary under all the circumstances, including, of
                            course, the views of the Brazilians and the concrete corrective and
                            control measures which they are prepared to apply to specific cases.</p>
                        <p>I am fearful that if recommendations for the Proclaimed List are
                            restricted to only those cases on which the Brazilian authorities have
                            no objection, we shall find that they are composed mainly of little
                            fellows or people without political influence. There has already been
                            considerable criticism on this score, and if the other agencies became
                            convinced that the Department’s leadership was producing this result,
                            they would secede and go their own way with lists of their own,
                            producing a situation far worse than anything the Brazilians have
                            feared. Needless to say we all recognize the necessity for taking
                            important political considerations into account in exceptional cases,
                            but if this is to be done such cases must be the exceptions rather than
                            the rule. As a matter of practical internal politics we can see how it
                            will be very difficult for the Brazilian officials to agree to many
                            cases being placed on the Proclaimed List. However, if they are prepared
                            to check our information against theirs through the joint consultations
                            and then let the decision and the onus of listing rest with us, their
                            position would seem to be less vulnerable, particularly when they can
                            subsequently intercede on a firm’s behalf to have the <pb n="763"
                                xml:id="pg_763" facs="0775"/>case considered for deletion on the
                            basis of corrective measures taken by the firm or the government.</p>
                        <p>Despatch no. 6518 states that the local committee is generally opposed to
                            inclusion of individuals on the Proclaimed List and suggests use of
                            confidential list for most such cases. This raises the whole question of
                            how far we can and should go in operating our controls on the basis of a
                            confidential list. We are in full agreement that individuals who are
                            connected with Proclaimed List firms but who would not be listed
                            otherwise should generally be placed on the confidential list merely as
                            potential cloaks. However, if an individual or a firm is engaged in
                            inimical activities so that its transactions should be subject to
                            effective control, the confidential list is not an adequate control
                            measure. I will only mention the most important reasons why this is
                            so:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1).</label>
                            <item>The list cannot be kept confidential with respect to the people
                                actually affected by the list. As soon as licenses are denied to the
                                firm, the persons concerned complain to this government or to their
                                government and all the controversies of public listing ensue.</item>

                            <item>To be an effective control measure the list would have to be put

                                business houses here and abroad that these houses frequently refuse
                                to take foreign commitments when there is, as at present, a surplus
                                of domestic orders. This aspect is particularly serious today when
                                we are almost forced to ask firms to maintain essential business
                                with the American republics.</item>
                            <label>5).</label>
                            <item>A confidential list cannot be worked along with general licenses,
                                all of which must be revoked if the control is to be in any measure
                                as complete as the Proclaimed List. Today the Board of Economic
                                Warfare still permits many items to move under general licenses to
                                the American republics and the Treasury Department, generally
                                speaking, permits all transactions incidental to inter-American
                                trade to move under general license if the person or firm is not on
                                the Proclaimed List. The Department, and I am sure the other
                                American republics, would be most reluctant to see these general
                                licenses withdrawn, but that is precisely what will be done if we
                                begin a general practice of placing numerous important cases on the
                                confidential list <pb n="764" xml:id="pg_764" facs="0776"/>rather
                                than on the Proclaimed List. The Treasury Department at present does
                                not operate on a confidential list but they will insist on doing so
                                if the Proclaimed List is to be seriously compromised. I am
                                reasonably certain that if we get a profusion of covert controls
                                there will be no inter-American trade.</item>

                            of November 25, 1942 [<hi rend="italic">1941</hi>]<note n="67"

                            utility, but our belief is that it is probably worthwhile if used as a
                            check on potential cloaks and as supplementary to rather than as an
                            alternative control for the Proclaimed List.</p>
                        <p>The whole situation as we see it comes down pretty much to this: a strong
                            Proclaimed List is a <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of getting
                            essential goods to Brazil as our production and licensing authorities
                            cannot justify the domestic sacrifices involved unless there is
                            reasonable assurance that the goods are only going to persons and firms
                            known to be affirmatively friendly to hemispheric defense and our war
                            aims; it is important for the Department and the diplomatic missions to
                            maintain a strong guiding hand on Proclaimed List policies, but this can
                            only be done by preserving the interdepartmental cooperation through the
                            Proclaimed List committee, and any attempt to delegate this authority to
                            the field or to put the Committee in the position whereby it is supposed
                            to act upon mere recommendations from the missions rather than upon full
                            information will surely result in each of the licensing authorities
                            going their independent ways and probably in a demand for independent
                            field people to handle the reporting on these matters.</p>
                        <p>I went over all of this with Dr. Souza Costa who appeared to be satisfied
                            and stated several times that all President Vargas asked was an
                            opportunity for the Brazilian officials to be heard before action was
                            taken here. But our interview was hurried and neither Duggan<note n="68"

                            nor I felt that we brought home to him the alternative to the Proclaimed
                            List which would result from administrative separatism here. In
                            particular I don’t believe we were successful in explaining to him the
                            vital connection between the maintenance of a strong Proclaimed List and
                            our common efforts to get essential goods to Brazil. The American people
                            and most of the people in the other American republics simply would not
                            understand nor long tolerate a policy on our part which resulted in our
                            severely limited exports being made available indiscriminately to our
                            friends and pro-Axis elements. Such a policy would be unfair to our
                            friends in Brazil and in the long run decidedly unrealistic politics for
                            all of us. It seems to us that this is the crux of the matter which in
                            some way we must <pb n="765" xml:id="pg_765" facs="0777"/>get home to
                            the Brazilian officials if we are to secure their sympathetic tolerance,
                            if not their acceptance of a strong Proclaimed List.</p>

                        <p>1123. I recommended to Aranha<note n="70" xml:id="d731fn70">Oswaldo

                            the two Governments reach an agreement with respect to the operation of
                            the Proclaimed List. He repeated his objections to the policy but
                            pointed out that in view of changing conditions in Brazil and the
                            increasing military and economic cooperation between the two Governments
                            that he now has no objection to our continuing the Proclaimed List but
                            that we should keep in mind that the policy should be directed only
                            against our common enemy.</p>
                        <p>He referred to other problems in the commerce between the two countries
                            and said that he would appoint a commission composed of myself, Souza
                            Costa, himself and any other persons we might designate together with
                            our advisers to review cases and to make final decisions on all phases
                            of our trade including the Proclaimed List. He said we would meet April

                        <p>In view of Aranha’s decision I may shortly recommend action on the

                            of the attitude of the Brazilian Government which I have not been in a

                        <p>Following a long discussion of the Proclaimed List policy as applied to
                            Brazil, the Brazilians decided to (1) waive all objections to
                            continuance of the Proclaimed List policy and administration and to
                            collaborate with us in this work, and (2) name a Consultative Committee
                            consisting of the Director of Exchange, the Chief of the Economic and
                            Commercial Section of the Foreign Office and my Commercial Attaché. The
                            President of the Bank of Brazil at the request of Aranha will keep in
                            close touch with the Committee on behalf of the Brazilian Government.
                            The Committee will (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) examine the present list
                            with a view to determining the types of control that should be adopted
                            over Axis commercial interests in Brazil; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            make recommendations to nationalize such interests, including banks;
                                (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) confer on choice of personnel to control
                            these Axis interests; and (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) suggest cases for
                            listing and delisting.</p>
                        <p>Aranha and Souza Costa favor the taking over of important Axis interests
                            in the near future and they may recommend a policy similar to the Alien
                            Property Custodian plan in the United States. They stressed the
                            importance of absolute secrecy in handling these cases.</p>

                            among the warring powers that commercial planes may not be shot down.
                            Aranha says he made him an evasive answer to this.</p>

                            anxious to cooperate with the Brazilian Government in every way possible
                            to ensure the successful reorganization and operation of Condor as a
                            Brazilian company. A definitive proposal is currently being worked out

                            number and what American or Brazilian personnel might be necessary or
                            advisable to replace them.</p>
                        <p>The Department feels sure that you will agree that a resumption of

                            It is, therefore, suggested that, on the basis of information available
                            to you, immediate conversations be initiated with the Brazilians for the
                            purpose particularly of seeing that suspect pilots and airfield
                            operators are immediately eliminated. The Department trusts that these
                            conversations can be carried on in a cooperative manner since it
                            obviously does not desire to make the furnishing of gasoline a <hi

                        <p>290. Your no. 333, February 3, 1942. You may give assurance to Aranha
                            that neither Panair do Brasil nor Pan American Airways will participate
                            in any plan of collaboration that may be worked out between
                            representatives of this Government and the Brazilian authorities in
                            connection with the operations of Condor. It is not the intention <pb
                                n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0782"/>of this Government to create
                            any monopoly of Brazilian aviation for Panair. You may state also that
                            in so far as may be desired by the Brazilian authorities this Government
                            is prepared to call upon Pan American Airways to cancel any extensions
                            of service within Brazil that may have been made as a result of the
                            cessation of the Condor flights.</p>
                        <p>Since it is understood that the Brazilian authorities will probably make
                            a request for the furnishing of gasoline to Condor, it is felt that you
                            should at the earliest moment endeavor to obtain a commitment from them
                            that in order that the company may be regarded as a bona fide national
                            organization the Brazilian Government will be disposed to assume
                            complete control and ownership of Condor and set it up as a wholly
                            Brazilian corporation thus divorcing it from all links with its past
                            corporate set up. While it would appear to be desirable for the name of
                            the company to be changed in order to lend emphasis to the fact that it
                            has been reorganized as a Brazilian national company, Department leaves
                            it to your discretion to decide whether it would be advisable to make a
                            suggestion to this effect to the Brazilian authorities.</p>
                        <p>It is deemed to be highly important that as a first step action be taken
                            with the view to eliminating from the Condor service all dangerous Axis
                            personnel or persons in sympathy with the Axis powers. It would seem
                            necessary at once to eliminate Hoelen<note n="87" xml:id="d739fn87"

                            assist in obtaining United States personnel on a temporary basis pending
                            training of satisfactory Brazilians for the positions vacated. This is
                            considered to be highly desirable in order that we may be in a position
                            to render as much assistance as possible in the way of furnishing
                            temporary substitute personnel as well as equipment. It is thought, in
                            this connection, that if reliable executive personnel could first be
                            provided it would be an important step in the direction of the removal
                            of all Axis influence from the Condor operation.</p>

                        <p>832. For the Acting Secretary. My 829, March 12, 7 p.m. Aranha tells me
                            that President Vargas himself was behind the orders given to Standard
                            Oil. Aranha says that on the one hand President Vargas is cooperating
                            and will continue to cooperate with us in the war business and has only
                            today put out decrees confiscating Axis properties, et cetera et cetera;
                            on the other hand he is convinced that the Washington authorities are
                            all wrong in their attitude to Condor which he considers, especially
                            since the dismissal of so many German employees, a purely Brazilian
                            company and “he is not” says Aranha “disposed to be dictated to by
                            Washington on this”.</p>
                        <p>However, Aranha says he has agreed with the Condor management that they
                            are willing to take on Hardin at once as adviser and follow his advice
                            in the reorganization of the company; they are willing also to change
                            the name but they cannot do that for some months in <pb n="774"

                        <p>837. For the Acting Secretary. My 829, March 12, 7 p.m. On Saturday last,
                            Ribeiro Dantas, Condor president, and Major Muricy went to see President
                            Vargas with a letter Dantas received from Harding when they were both in
                            Buenos Aires recently. The letter contained the following: “I would
                            recommend that the American Government cooperate with Condor if you take
                            the following steps to insure severance of all Axis connections:” Then
                            followed the conditions which in themselves are not objectionable.</p>
                        <p>However, President Vargas did not like this and had the order issued to
                            Standard Oil.</p>
                        <p>Aranha says that as much as Vargas wants to cooperate with us in the war
                            against Germany, he is not happy about what he considers attempts on our
                            part to interfere in his domestic concerns.</p>
                        <p>He feels now apparently about the Proclaimed List as Aranha did a couple
                            of months ago. “He feels likewise”, says Aranha, “that he is perfectly
                            competent to decide what activities here are harmful to Brazil and what
                            are not.”</p>
                        <p>Aranha invited pointed attention also to remarks of President Roosevelt
                            in regard to the attitude to be taken to aliens in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Aranha said moreover that if Standard Oil refused to deliver the 10,000
                            liters of gasoline at Corumbá and the 15,000 liters at São Luiz the
                            matter would become one for immediate Government action. Under those
                            circumstances I told Standard this morning that it would be the better
                            part of discretion for them to deliver the gasoline; especially as the
                            amounts are small.</p>
                        <p>I take Hardin to a meeting with Aranha, Dantas and Muricy this
                            afternoon.</p>

                        <p>652. Your 829, March 12, 7 p.m., 832, March 12, 11 p.m., and 837, March
                            13, noon. I am requesting the proper persons interested in this matter
                            to meet on Monday to canvass it anew with a view to sending you a
                            detailed statement of the Department’s views. In this connection it
                            would be helpful to have in addition to your report of your conversation
                            yesterday with Aranha your recommendations as to the best way to proceed
                            in this difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>You, of course, are thoroughly aware that the War Department looks with
                            great concern upon the continued and unrestricted use by Condor of its
                            radio facilities. Reports received from absolutely reliable sources
                            indicate that the Axis is kept fully posted on the movement of all
                            United States military aircraft through Brazil.</p>
                        <p>From what I know of the situation, it seems that the status of Hardin now
                            becomes almost the crux of the situation because if Condor really
                            follows his advice in effecting the complete reorganization of the
                            company, we would fully attain our objective.</p>
                        <p>I agree that under the circumstances you took the right course in
                            authorizing the delivery to Condor of the gasoline ordered by the
                            Brazilian Government. I hope, however, that it will be possible to avoid
                            future requests until you are satisfied that the company no longer is a
                            threat.</p>

                        <p>686. Your recent telegrams on Condor. In view of your references to the
                            requisitioning by the Brazilian Army of the remaining stock of gasoline
                            belonging to Condor, Lati, and Air France the thought arose at an
                            interdepartmental meeting March 16 that this may have been a stratagem
                            adopted by Gomes for the purpose of removing the gasoline in question
                            from the licensing control exercised by this Government. Such a
                            subterfuge obviously would be inconsistent with Aranha’s professions
                            contained in your 878 of March 14, 7 p.m.<note n="1" xml:id="d749fn1"
                                >Not printed.</note> In addition it is felt that in the event of an
                            unsatisfactory reorganization of Condor such a development would
                            seriously complicate the situation. An expression of your views will be

                            Condor warrant such action and would facilitate future negotiations, we
                            would recommend that the Treasury grant licenses for the sale of
                            specific amounts of gasoline approved by you. It should, of course, be
                            clearly understood and agreed to by the Brazilians that the granting of
                            any such licenses is based on the assumption that the complete
                            de-Germanization of Condor is proceeding. We strongly hope, however,
                            that it will be possible to avoid the licensing stage.</p>
                        <p>As a final step after delisting, an arrangement could be made whereby
                            Condor’s successor would obtain such needed equipment as is possible to
                            secure for it provided at least one JU–52 is surrendered for each new
                            airplane furnished, and provided that a sound technical and financial
                            basis is established. In this connection, the Defense Supplies
                            Corporation has a firm commitment from the War Department that the seven
                            DC–3’s recently taken away from it by the War Department will be
                            replaced beginning in June or July. You may assure the Brazilians that
                            the Defense Supplies will be able and willing <pb n="777"
                                xml:id="pg_777" facs="0789"/>to provide the new company new
                            equipment beginning in June or July provided that the conditions
                            mentioned above are fulfilled by that time.</p>
                        <p>In other words, there could be three steps; the first to consist of
                            specified and limited licensing of gasoline on the basis of progress
                            already made and satisfactory commitments for the future; second, formal
                            delisting when the points enumerated above have been met; and third,
                            whatever equipment and financial assistance may be needed after the
                            company has operated on the new basis for a few months. It should be
                            understood that step 1 would not be taken unless the Brazilians agreed
                            to take the succeeding measure leading to delisting, and that step 3

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My dear Mr. Minister</hi>: As Your Excellency is
                            aware, I have been endeavoring for some time and am still endeavoring to
                            help Condor. As Your Excellency is also aware, our efforts have been
                            successful to the point of making arrangements at Washington for
                            necessary material and technicians.</p>
                        <p>However, I must repeat that in my frank opinion, notwithstanding the fact
                            that a number of very useful steps have been taken by the Brazilian
                            Government to cut Condor loose entirely from Lufthansa, all the
                            necessary steps have not yet been taken.</p>
                        <p>In view of the well known desire of the Brazilian authorities to sever
                            completely all ties between the Deutsche Lufthansa (which is, in effect,
                            the German Government) and the Serviços Aéreos Condor. I venture to make
                            the following suggestions:</p>
                        <p>1. All outstanding contracts, commitments and agreements between Condor
                            and Lufthansa to be specifically annulled and cancelled by law. (This
                            especially refers to the exchange of letters between Condor and
                            Lufthansa dated December 31, 1941 and the new social contract of Condor
                            dated January 6, 1942. These documents clearly show that just as soon as
                            the war is over, Lufthansa will once more in fact control Condor. See
                            enclosure No. 1.<note n="11" xml:id="d754fn11">Not printed.</note>)</p>
                        <p>2. Liquidation of Condor’s indebtedness to Lufthansa which is on the
                            books for 54,989 contos. This debt to be completely wiped out. Obviously
                            it is for the Brazilian Government to decide whether it desires to
                            assume this debt or whether it is to be liquidated or cancelled in some
                            other convenient manner.</p>
                        <p>3. Although Condor has made great strides in the Brazilianization of the
                            line, the financial and corporate structure of the company is <pb
                                n="780" xml:id="pg_780" facs="0792"/>still very confused. It could
                            be reorganized so that it would possess a solid legal and factual
                            structure, which it lacks today. For example, I cannot believe that the
                            Brazilian Government wishes simply to turn over the very valuable Condor
                            property, which is unquestionably worth many thousands of contos, to the
                            five Brazilian private partners, who have obtained control of it for 100
                            contos, the total capital!</p>
                        <p>In view of the very close connections which the present Condor partners
                            maintained with the former Condor–Lufthansa set-up, and the nature of
                            the December 31, 1941 agreement and the contract of January 6, 1942, it
                            is difficult to avoid the conclusion that although these Brazilian
                            partners are nominally in possession of the quotas comprising the 100
                            contos capital, they might be holding them in trust for the German
                            interests until hostilities have ceased.</p>
                        <p>Again I venture a suggestion, and that is that the answer to the problem
                            might be in the conversion of Condor into a Sociedade Anonyma. In this
                            manner the properties which are worth, say 40,000 or 50,000 contos,
                            would appear in the form of capital and thus title to the assets of the
                            company would not remain in the hands of the Germans. Furthermore, in
                            accordance with the law of Sociedades Anonymas (Decreto-Lei No. 2627,
                            September 26, 1940) the shares would have to be nominative. However,
                            this of course would be a matter for the Brazilian Government to
                            decide.</p>
                        <p>4. I venture another suggestion and that is that, in my opinion, an
                            excellent impression would be made if the name “Condor” were changed
                            into, say, a name like “Rondon” for instance.</p>
                        <p>5. Finally, I venture to invite attention to the fact that Herr Ernest
                            Holck is still a director of the company.</p>

                        <pb n="781" xml:id="pg_781" facs="0793"/>
                        <p>We are hopeful, however, that when the Brazilian Government and the
                            Condor organization take steps which would justify removal of that
                            company from the Proclaimed List, it will be possible to find, on
                            reasonably short notice, satisfactory technicians in this country, if
                            they are wanted.</p>
                        <p>It probably will not be possible to hold the DC–3 airplanes, earmarked
                            for Condor, which will be delivered to the Defense Supplies Corporation
                            in July, but we believe that it will be possible to obtain, in
                            replacement for these, three others from the War Department when and if
                            Condor is removed from the Proclaimed List and it is otherwise
                            considered advisable to sell it this equipment.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the sale of gasoline to Condor by the Brazilian
                            Government, we cannot lose sight of the fact that a commodity, of which
                            there is a shortage, and which is produced in the United States or
                            abroad by United States companies, and which occupies scarce shipping
                            space, is being diverted by the Brazilian Government to a Proclaimed
                            List firm which we consider to be German in important respects. The
                            Department is confident that both you and Aranha will appreciate the
                            adverse effect of this situation upon the effectiveness of the economic
                            warfare effort of the two Governments.</p>

                            a copy of a letter which I have received from Aranha in which he

                            he contends satisfactorily answers the questions raised in my letter of

                        <p>He told me that the delay in reaching the solution of Condor’s status is
                            irritating President Vargas; causing him, Aranha, a variety of
                            difficulties; and impelling General Eduardo Gomes to reprisals. He
                            pleads that something be done to settle the matter.</p>
                        <p>Aranha asserts that Central Powers already complied with most of our
                            Condor demands; that they have dismissed 200 employees, et cetera, et
                            cetera; that Condor is losing money every day. He says: “Send us some
                            one who can go into Condor and tell them what to do: They <pb n="782"

                        <p>I said: “What about changing the name?” He said: “That can be done

                        <p>2122. The Department believes that prompt decisions are indicated in
                            relation to current aviation problems in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>(1) Condor. Your telegram 2720 of July 25, 7 p.m. The Department regrets
                            that the letter from Aranha enclosed with your despatch 8033 of July 25
                            is not accompanied by your specific recommendation whether Condor should
                            or should not be delisted. For your information Defense Supplies
                            Corporation has for some time had seven DC–3 planes on order for Brazil,
                            some of them to be available for Condor. These planes are now about
                            ready but in view of the extreme shortage of equipment it is unthinkable
                            that they be left idle. In view however of the unsatisfactory nature of
                            Aranha’s reply to your letter of July [<hi rend="italic">June</hi>] 1,
                            the Defense Supplies Corporation may be reluctantly forced to allocate
                            these planes elsewhere for their immediate use in the most efficient
                            manner. For example, we hope to use some of them in any case in Brazil
                            for the building up of increased services to and within the Amazon
                            region in connection with the rubber development program.<note n="17"

                        <p>Although it may be possible to earmark additional planes from future
                            production for Condor, it should be borne in mind that when the
                            conditions for delisting Condor are met it may not be practical to lay
                            hands on planes for it immediately. In this connection please furnish
                            specific details concerning the points which in your opinion remain to
                            be cleared up before delisting can be recommended.</p>

                            especially Brazil and was operated by Pan American Airways rather than
                            Panair do Brasil to permit the most efficient use of equipment, et
                            cetera in the face of the imperative demands of the armed forces for
                            flying equipment, pilots, et cetera.</p>

                        <p>3908. The loss of a Panair do Brasil airplane 2 days ago plus the
                            increasing demand for services make it desirable that Panair do Brasil,
                            which can certainly use them, be provided with more airplanes. The loss
                            of the DC–2’s without replacement would seriously reduce Panair do
                            Brasil’s services.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested therefore that two of the Defense Supplies’ Lockheed
                            Lodestars be sold or leased to Panair as soon as possible. The Air
                            Ministry strongly objects to letting the two DC–2’s sold to Pluna<note
                                n="27" xml:id="d759fn27">Uruguayan airline.</note> leave Brazil. It
                            is believed however that these objections will be overcome if two
                            Lodestars are forthcoming for Panair do Brasil. Obviously definite
                            permission would be obtained to remove the DC–2’s from Brazil prior to
                            the sending of the Lodestars. Satterthwaite concurs.</p>

                                    ago, has been concluded. The Serviços Aéreos Condor, through

                                    Governments, has accordingly been removed from the Proclaimed

                        <p>3750. The Department is in receipt of a letter from the Defense Supplies
                                Corporation<note n="42" xml:id="d767fn42">Not printed.</note>
                            calling attention to the fact that the contract between Defense Supplies
                            Corporation and Pan American Airways providing for additional services
                            by Panair do Brasil over routes operated or formerly operated by Condor
                            expires December 31, and, that before December 10, Defense Supplies
                            Corporation must advise Pan American Airways whether it desires this
                            contract renewed. War feels that, in view of the removal of Condor from
                            the Proclaimed List, there is no reason for requiring the continuation
                            of these services. Pan American Airways may, of course, continue to
                            cause them to be operated by Panair after the termination of the
                            contract but we have <pb n="789" xml:id="pg_789" facs="0801"/>no
                            assurances that they will do so. If Pan American Airways (or Panair)

                            in your opinion, cause any resentment on the part of the Brazilian
                            Government which might adversely affect favorable solutions of important
                            aviation matters now pending such as the restoration of all Pan American
                            Airways international schedules through the cut-off, the Aerovias Brasil

                                    securities which are subject to similar control, the provisions
                                    of the amended general ruling applicable to currency imported
                                    from Latin America will be so administered as to prevent
                                    interference with legitimate importations of currency from that
                                    area, including the bringing in by travelers of reasonable
                                    amounts of currency for traveling expenses. Treasury officials
                                    suggested that the fact that an importation of currency from
                                    Latin America was bona fide could be more easily established if
                                    such currency were sent into the United States by and for the
                                    account of the central banks (or the equivalent or analogous
                                    institutions) of any of the American republics under appropriate
                                    assurances from such banks or institutions.”</p>

                        <p>You are instructed to arrange as soon as practicable a meeting with the
                            Minister of Finance or other appropriate officials of the government to
                            which you are accredited and bring the foregoing to their attention. You
                            should assure the Minister of Finance, particularly if substantial
                            amounts of American currency circulate from hand to hand in his country,
                            that every effort will be made to prevent interference with legitimate
                            importations of currency into the United States and further that it is
                            not the intent of this Government to impede the use of United States
                            currency as part of the circulating media of such American republics as
                            have found dollar currency a convenient supplement to their own
                            currency.</p>
                        <p>You may point out, however, that the Axis countries, particularly
                            Germany, are known to have seized large amounts of American dollar
                            currency and that this currency is being disposed of in part by channels
                            involving persons in neutral countries of Europe and various persons in
                            the American republics. By these means the Germans are able to acquire
                            foreign exchange for their war effort.</p>
                        <p>It is the hope of this Government that the American republics in keeping
                            with the spirit of Resolution No. V of the Third Meeting of the Foreign

                                Resolution V recommended that the American Republics cut off
                                commercial and financial intercourse with nations signatory to the
                                Tripartite Pact (League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. <hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">cciv</hi>, p. 386).</note> will cooperate to
                            the best of their ability in defeating the Axis countries in their
                            efforts to derive advantage from looted currency.</p>
                        <p>To this end it is suggested that the export of dollar currency from
                            countries having central banks be restricted to such banks, which, it is
                            assumed, will make every effort to convince themselves that all dollar
                            currency which they buy from individuals and other banks is not directly
                            or indirectly related to liquidation of currency by the Axis. Pending
                            investigation by the Central Bank as to whether there is a direct or
                            indirect Axis interest in imported currency, the Central Bank might
                            place such currency into blocked accounts.</p>
                        <pb n="791" xml:id="pg_791" facs="0803"/>
                        <p>It should be emphasized that the mere fact that currency has been
                            imported from Europe is regarded by this Government as prima facie
                            evidence that there is beneficial Axis interest in such currency.
                            Moreover, so long as dollar currency moves freely from neutral European
                            countries to the Western Hemisphere, a market for such currency is
                            maintained which is of benefit to the Axis. This Government would view
                            with favor action by the American republics to prohibit further
                            importation of dollar currency from countries outside the Western
                            Hemisphere except reasonable amounts imported by travelers. Such action
                            by the other American republics would be given appropriate weight in the
                            administrative applications of General Ruling No. 5 to currency exported
                            by the central banks of such countries to the United States and would
                            contribute to the protection of their nationals from the risks of loss
                            involved in dealings in currency originating with the Axis.</p>
                        <p>In the case of countries which do not have a central bank, it is
                            suggested that exports of currency be confined to a similar institution
                            designated by the Government.</p>

                            will be used in the case of holdings by Axis nationals and procedure
                                (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) will be used in cases of Brazilian[s] or
                            nationals whose connections are dubious or whose explanations of

                            the notes before being returned to owner in order to prevent their
                            subsequent sale to the bank through other parties; copies of these
                            records will be forwarded by the Embassy to the Department.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that this registration will effectively meet the problem
                            inasmuch as offerings of currency subsequent to May 25 will be subjected
                            to the presumption of contraband. It is of course a corollary to this
                            program that the Treasury Department will refuse to license importation
                            of currency from Brazil other than those made for account of Bank of
                            Brazil except shipments which left this country before May 19.</p>
                        <p>This further evidence of prompt and effective cooperation of the Minister
                            of Finance and the Bank of Brazil merits in my opinion a telegram of

                        <p>1787. Department’s circular of May 18, 4 p.m. Deposits in Rio de Janeiro
                            total $1,119,000. Estimate for the entire country approximately
                            $1,600,000. Embassy is reviewing Rio registration cases of late; it does
                            not appear that all of Axis dollar holdings have been deposited.</p>
                        <p>Under the present arrangement Embassy agreed to following alternative
                            recommendations vis-à-vis objectionable persons or firms who deposited
                                (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) reimbursement in milreis, (<hi

                            convinced that control under (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) is enough to do
                            much damage to Axis nationals. Alternative (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                            has the advantage of removing currency from circulation but will give
                            Axis milreis funds at normal rate of 19 milreis 300. Alternative (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) will destroy Axis assets by amount of
                            depreciation in local black exchange. Only local market remaining is for
                            purchases by persons who desire to hold on [<hi rend="italic">for?</hi>]
                            speculation until after war. This potential market is narrow at present
                            due to uncertainty.</p>
                        <p>Only other possible markets are in verified areas particularly Argentina
                            which have not adopted measures to implement amendment General Ruling 5.
                            Will Treasury controls over imports currency from areas other than
                            Brazil be enough to eliminate dollar market Argentine and elsewhere?
                            Please telegraph views of Treasury and Department on alternatives.</p>
                        <p>Would the Department recommend Embassy request Bank of Brazil to stamp
                            United States notes to be returned to Axis depositors? If so what form

                        <p>1417. Your 1787, May 27, 6 p.m. The Department and Treasury regret that
                            alternative methods were deemed necessary with respect to the handling
                            of dollar currency of undesirable origin by the Brazilian authorities.
                            The attachment to your despatch No. 7373 of May 20<note n="50"
                                xml:id="d772fn50">Not printed.</note> seemed to indicate that, in
                            the case of dollar currency the origin of which was deemed
                            unsatisfactory, the currency would be returned to the owner and that
                            payment in milreis or establishing a credit would be utilized only in
                            other cases. It is felt that the return of dollar currency to depositors
                            is the most effective method of preventing the Axis powers from
                            realizing on their loot and it is hoped that the Brazilian authorities
                            will see fit to deal with tainted dollar currency solely on this
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>The Department recommends that you urge the Bank of Brazil to stamp
                            dollar currency before returning to depositors. The stamp should take
                            the form of a perforated mark so as to avoid the possibility of the mark
                            being removed. It is felt that the stamping of returned currency with a
                            perforated mark is the only way that the <pb n="795" xml:id="pg_795"
                                facs="0807"/>movement of dollar currency can be effectively
                            controlled so as to minimize the ability of the Axis powers to convert
                            their loot. The recording of serial numbers will also be helpful but it
                            is felt that such procedure alone will be too cumbersome to be effective
                            because of the amounts involved. It is suggested that recorded numbers
                            be forwarded to the Department as promptly as possible.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the other alternatives, you should point out the
                            following to the Bank of Brazil: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>reimbursement in milreis will give funds to undesirables at
                                    the possible expense of the Bank since, because of the
                                    currency’s Axis taint, the Bank may encounter difficulty when it
                                    subsequently attempts to liquidate the dollar currency thus
                                    acquired.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>placing milreis in a controlled account will involve the same
                                    possibility of loss to the Bank as outlined in (1) to the extent
                                    that funds are paid out from such account. Furthermore, the
                                    Department agrees with your views as to the general
                                    ineffectiveness of such control and hopes that you will be able
                                    discreetly to persuade the Bank not to adopt this
                                    procedure.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>If it is not possible to limit the procedure as outlined above, the
                            Department recommends that you suggest to the Bank of Brazil that
                            deposits of dollar currency by undesirables be placed in controlled
                            dollar accounts and that withdrawals from such accounts be limited to
                            amounts needed for reasonable living expenses and be in the form of
                            dollar currency stamped with a perforated mark in the manner heretofore
                            suggested.</p>
                        <p>Your telegram indicates that controlled accounts will be used only for
                            Axis nationals. If the procedure is not limited to return of the dollar
                            currency, the Department recommends that the blocked dollar account
                            method be used for all undesirables be they Axis nationals or not in
                            order that the controls be as effective as possible.</p>
                        <p>It has further been noted that your telegram deals only with deposits by
                            undesirables, although the attachment to your despatch indicates that
                            currency whose origin was deemed unsatisfactory would be returned
                            irrespective of the character of the depositor. It is believed that this
                            change of procedure, if a change has taken place, is predicated upon the
                            feeling that friendly persons who acquired dollar currency in good faith
                            prior to the promulgation of the controls should not be punished. This
                            attitude is probably not objectionable, provided that in the future
                            administration of the controls, any deposits of unstamped dollar
                            currency after May 22 and May 25, respectively, will be presumed to have
                            an Axis taint and be dealt with accordingly, regardless of the character
                            of the person who makes the deposit.</p>
                        <p>If the Brazilian controls are made internally effective, it is not
                            expected that they will be undermined by markets in other areas which
                            have not adopted measures implementing general ruling no. 5, <pb n="796"
                                xml:id="pg_796" facs="0808"/>as Treasury intends to scrutinize
                            dollar imports from such areas with particular care.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the dollar currency held by the Spanish and French
                            Embassies, it is suggested that you try discreetly to bring the facts to
                            the attention of the appropriate Brazilian authorities with the view to
                            having them make strong protests to the Spanish and French upon the
                            basis that the latter are using their diplomatic immunity to indulge in
                            actions to benefit economically countries unfriendly to the Brazilian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>While it is realized that Brazil has gone a long way in cooperating with
                            this Government in the control of currency movements, as well as in
                            other fields, it is hoped that at an opportune moment you will suggest
                            to the appropriate authorities that, in the interests of uniformity with
                            measures already adopted by the United States, Brazil will extend its
                            controls to cover all foreign currency.</p>

                        <p>1921. The Bank of Brazil has received a telegraphic request from the Bank
                            of International Settlements, Basel, Switzerland, to transfer to the
                            Banco Central in Buenos Aires the 503 kilos of gold held in the Bank of
                            Brazil for its account.</p>
                        <p>The Bank of Brazil has replied: “We believe that Brazilian authorities
                            would not permit exportation of the gold during the emergency.”</p>

                            all missions in the South American Republics. (See Department’s circular
                            telegram of June 19, 1942, 11 p.m.)<note n="52" xml:id="d775fn52">Not

                                control through receiving applications for the release of currency
                                forwarded to the United States by the Central Bank. The application
                                was designed to elicit a variety of facts concerning the source of
                                the currency. (811.51/4186a)</note></p>
                        <p>Please emphasize to the Finance Minister that this program has been
                            adopted by Treasury because of the necessity for uniformity of treatment
                            by the United States with respect to all importations of currency and
                            because of the existence in other American Republics of conditions which
                            do not exist in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>You are authorized to state to the Minister of Finance in confidence that
                            the recommendations of the Government of Brazil or of the Bank of Brazil
                            will be given preponderant weight in the determination by Treasury as to
                            whether currency imported from Brazil under this arrangement should be
                            released.</p>
                        <p>It is expected that certain special arrangements may have to be made for
                            Brazil, but an attempt should be made to have the Bank of Brazil send to
                            the United States as much of the currency already deposited with them as
                            they can on the basis above indicated without violating any undertakings
                            that they have already made with respect to such currency. If Brazil’s
                            present regulations do not permit the forwarding of dollar currency on
                            such basis, it is hoped that the regulations can be appropriately
                            altered to permit such disposition of the currency. Please cable at once
                            if this is not possible.</p>
                        <p>We hope to be able to make special adjustments for Brazil in our own
                            program to provide a smooth working arrangement with the Brazilian
                            authorities.</p>

                            banknotes. The Bank of Brazil’s deposit currency plan of May 21 (see my
                            telegram 1742, May 21 [<hi rend="italic">22</hi>]) appeared to be highly
                            satisfactory to the Department of State and Treasury Department as

                            of the plan left me with the impression that the Treasury Department
                            approved and that if it raised any objections in the future that they
                            would not be retroactive.</p>
                        <p>After an administrative review which included checking of names with the
                            Foreign Office, Bank of Brazil, Proclaimed List Section, Political
                            Section, Military, Naval Attaché, Consulate, and friendly diplomatic
                            missions in regard to their own nationals, Embassy approved 335 deposits
                            totalling $163,973 for liquidation in milreis. Bank of Brazil has
                            purchased the dollars and has paid milreis to the depositors. Conversion
                            of additional deposits of less than $100 each has been approved after
                            consular investigation in cases of recently arrived American tourists,
                            naval and army personnel, merchant seamen, ferry command personnel, this
                            has totaled 10,875.80 in Rio de Janeiro for 150 individuals. There have
                            been many more cases especially in northern Brazil. Is the Embassy
                            correct in assuming that Treasury will automatically license importation
                            of these sums by Bank of Brazil with Embassy certificate?</p>
                        <p>(Section 3) It is believed that for the following reasons plan adopted in
                            Brazil is more practical than that outlined in Department’s circular of

                        <p>If the Department so desires Embassy will adopt new plan for the balance
                            of deposits which have not been liquidated. Under existing legislation
                            in Brazil this means giving the depositor the option of having his
                            dollars returned to him or of forwarding by the Bank to the United
                            States on a collection basis as prescribed. It should be recognized
                            however that taking this action appears inconsistent to Brazilian
                            authorities who have cooperated so effectively to date; that it makes no
                            provision for the handling of consular fees and future meritorious cases
                            in which it is in the interest of the United States to request the Bank
                            of Brazil to purchase American currency for milreis; and that the
                            inevitable delays which this centralized procedure entails will create
                            ill will among the many small depositors who acted in good faith in
                            making their deposits. It will be recalled that the original Brazilian
                            plan made provision for forwarding to the United States for deposit in
                            special accounts of dollars held by objectionable depositors.</p>

                        <p>1668. Your 2160, June 22, 9 p.m. The Department is, of course, most
                            anxious to avoid placing you in an embarrassing position with the
                            Brazilian authorities and as previously indicated this Government is
                            most appreciative of the cooperation of the Brazilian Government and
                            intends to do everything possible to minimize possible <pb n="801"
                                xml:id="pg_801" facs="0813"/>difficulties. As was indicated in the
                            latter part of the Department’s telegram no. 1597, June 19, 10 p.m., it
                            was recognized that the prior prompt and unqualified cooperation of the
                            Brazilian Government in instituting currency controls would undoubtedly
                            necessitate special arrangements in order to integrate its controls with
                            proposed Treasury program.</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian authorities should be assured that, if the Treasury’s
                            problem were merely that of dealing with currency from Brazil, it would
                            be very easy to solve. However, this Government has the problem of
                            dealing with currency from a large number of countries, including all
                            the American Republics. If a uniform general procedure had not been
                            adopted by the Treasury, it would have been extremely difficult for the
                            United States to place effective controls on those countries refusing to
                            cooperate or whose cooperation was merely nominal. It is believed that
                            the procedure adopted is flexible enough to permit sympathetic
                            cooperation with Brazil.</p>
                        <p>In line with this approach, and in view of the fact that Brazil has
                            severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers and has instituted
                            extensive economic and financial controls pursuant to Resolution V,<note

                                        authorities to forward all United States currency to the

                                        currency should be placed in a blocked account in Brazil

                                        strong effort should be made to have the owner voluntarily

                                        numbers of the currency to enforce observance. The owner
                                        should also be cautioned that, as the Treasury procedure
                                        indicates, the Treasury expects to refuse applications for
                                        the release of currency which is not promptly forwarded to
                                        the United States and that consequently, it is to his own
                                        interest to act at once.</item>

                                    <item>Wherever it is at all possible under the Brazilian
                                        regulations, United States currency should not be released
                                        to persons in Brazil even for subsistence purposes. When the
                                        Department previously suggested that United States currency
                                        might be returned, it was with the thought that it would be
                                        perforated by Brazilian authorities and its origin thus
                                        clearly indicated. In this connection it should be noted
                                        that the return of dollars condones the existence of a black
                                        market and is inconsistent with the prohibition which the
                                        Department understands exists in the Brazilian law; namely,
                                        that all dealings in dollar currency are illegal. Where a
                                        person is actually in dire need of funds for subsistence
                                        purposes (including a friendly refugee) and such person has
                                        complied with all provisions of the Brazilian decree, the
                                        Treasury would be prepared to accept the following
                                        arrangement: such person should place all his United States
                                        currency in a blocked account. The Bank of Brazil might then
                                        agree to sell him sufficient milreis for subsistence
                                        purposes (holding the amount to a minimum) and accept
                                        dollars therefor; provided that in no event would more than
                                        25 percent of such person’s currency be permitted to be
                                        acquired pursuant to this arrangement. Dollars acquired by
                                        the Bank of Brazil under this arrangement would be accepted
                                        by the Treasury. Moreover, this procedure would be
                                        conditioned upon the person involved promptly authorizing
                                        the forwarding of the balance of his currency to the United
                                        States under the Treasury procedure.</item>

                            appreciate your telegraphing your views as to whether the above outlined
                            procedure is possible of adoption in Brazil. Should there be any

                            sympathetically.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the question which you raised in point 1 of section 3 of
                            your telegram under reference, your attention is called to the fact that
                            the Treasury recommendations for currency controls contemplated the
                            fixing of a particular date for the deposit of dollars in the same
                            manner as Brazil has done. However, problems may arise in connection
                            with deposits made after any such date either by persons entering the
                            country after such date, or by persons in the country having a change of
                            heart with respect to currency in their possession.</p>

                            Department’s 1668, June 25, 10 p.m. I am of the opinion that the plan
                            suggested by the Department’s telegram under reference requires some
                            modification in order to meet the actualities of the current situation
                            in Brazil. Of the 1306 depositors throughout Brazil 986 had deposits of
                            less than $500 but these represent less than 20% of money deposited. I
                            am of the opinion that the United States has much more to lose from the
                            standpoint of public relations in Brazil than it could possibly gain in
                            regard to Axis funds by requiring that any of these smaller deposits
                            other than those held by objectionable persons be forwarded to the
                            United States on a basis of collection. The reasons for this conclusion

                                <item>That the Bank of Brazil does not have the administrative
                                    facilities available to enable it to certify whether the facts

                                <item>That many of these small deposits are held by Brazilians who
                                    acquired them while in the United States or other American
                                    Republics on business or pleasure trips, and they naturally will
                                    be irritated at the additional red tape and delay;</item>

                                    of small means who are already panic-stricken over the
                                    possibilities of confiscation;</item>

                                    Republics who were caught in Brazil on business or pleasure
                                    trips and who have borrowed milreis funds on the expectation of
                                    a prompt settlement of their cases;</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>That the foregoing factors would create a fertile field for
                                    anti-American agitation if the plan is adopted. Furthermore, a
                                    study of declaration statements of these small deposits
                                    indicates that current Axis interest is confined to exceptional
                                    cases which will not, of course, be liquidated in
                                    milreis.</item>

                                <item>That the Treasury agree to license the importation into the

                                    of less than $500 made by unobjectionable depositors;</item>

                                <item>That the Embassy will follow the procedure outlined by the
                                    Department for all deposits of more than $500. It is suggested,
                                    however, that instead of the 25% limitation on conversion into
                                    milreis on these larger deposits, a flat maximum of $500 be
                                    established. (This to be used only in cases of necessity and
                                    after agreement to send balance as collection to the United
                                    States.)</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>It will be necessary in some cases to exceed the $100
                                    limitation for new cases. For instance, the Consulate at Natal
                                    has reported that ferry command personnel and travelers en route
                                    to the United States from Africa for war purposes are frequently
                                    held over in that city for 2 weeks or more. The Embassy has
                                    pending at the present time other diplomatic cases of travelers
                                    who arrived in Brazil recently with no funds other than American
                                    currency.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Whether the Bank of Brazil is willing to adopt any alternative
                                    other than the return of dollar currency to persons who refuse
                                    to have their deposits forwarded to the United States on a
                                    collection basis is a question which can only be decided by the
                                    Director of Exchange, Doctor [Santos] Filho, who is now in
                                    Washington. He is the only Brazilian official in a position of
                                    authority in regard to dollar control and it is suggested that
                                    the Department and Treasury arrive at a decision with him in
                                    regard to the proposal made in section 3 (<hi rend="italic"

                            of less than $500.</p>

                            procedure have been explained to the Treasury Department. As a result

                                    Consulate when shipped to the United States. It is assumed that

                                    increase in the facilities made available to Brazil under the
                                    agreement are a further evidence of the close and friendly
                                    relations existing between the two countries and constitute an
                                    assurance of continued cooperation between the two treasuries.
                                    The friendship and understanding symbolized by this and other
                                    agreements with our great sister republic in South America
                                    promise much for both a joint attack on the problems of the war
                                    and a solution for our common problems in the peace.”</p>

                            the holding of dollar currency by private persons is not prohibited
                            under existing Brazilian regulations since the Bank of Brazil has made

                            of the political questions involved. However, the following plan of
                            procedure is suggested: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>With respect to the deposit by the French Embassy you will be
                                    interested to know that the French have asked Treasury to make
                                    arrangements for licensing the use of blocked funds in this
                                    country for the support of their Missions in the other American
                                    republics. The request of the French was based upon the fact
                                    that they were unable to use the currency because of the
                                    restrictions imposed by the other American republics. The French
                                    have been told that before attention can be given to the problem
                                    of licensing the use of blocked funds in this country it will be
                                    necessary for them to forward to the United States on a
                                    collection basis all currency held directly or indirectly for
                                    the account of the French Government in the other American
                                    republics. In view of this development it is believed that the
                                    matter of the French deposit can be held in abeyance pending an
                                    indication from the French as to whether they will comply with
                                    the foregoing stipulation. It would seem that the failure of the
                                    French to deposit all of their dollar currency constituted a
                                    violation of the Brazilian currency controls and that
                                    consequently an adequate legal basis may exist for refusing to
                                        <pb n="808" xml:id="pg_808" facs="0820"/>return the currency
                                    which has been deposited or to convert it into milreis, at least
                                    temporarily.</item>

                                <item>With respect to the deposit by the Spanish Ambassador, it is
                                    suggested that you make every effort through the Brazilian
                                    authorities to persuade him to have the currency forwarded to
                                    the United States on a collection basis. In the event that your
                                    efforts in this connection are unsuccessful, it would appear
                                    that there will be no alternative but to return the currency.
                                    Before so doing, however, it is suggested that the Brazilian
                                    authorities advise the Spanish Ambassador that this Government
                                    has a complete record of the serial numbers. Also it is
                                    suggested that you discuss with the Brazilian authorities the
                                    possibility of placing some stamp or mark on this currency
                                    before returning it to the Spanish Ambassador. It is recognized
                                    that in your telegram 1975, June 10, 9 p.m. you reported that
                                    there was no legal provision in Brazil permitting this
                                    procedure, but it is thought that the fact that Brazil is now at
                                    war may afford a basis for reconsidering this
                                    possibility.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Please keep the Department advised of all developments.</p>

                            1942. The instructions of the Bank of Brazil of May 20, 1942, attached
                            as an enclosure to the Embassy’s despatch No. 7373 of May 20, 1942,<note
                                n="68" xml:id="d784fn68">Not printed.</note> designated the Bank of
                            Brazil as the exclusive forwarder to the United States of American
                            dollar currency destined for exchange into milreis or for deposit to a
                            credit in the United States, and at the same time suspended the
                            authorization for any other banking institution or exchange houses to
                            deal in American dollar currency. However, this instruction by the Bank
                            of Brazil did not prohibit the holding of American dollar currency by
                            any person or institution other than the Bank of Brazil. The regulations
                            adopted by the Bank of Brazil, in accordance with the Embassy’s
                            recommendations, to all practical purposes limited the market for
                            American dollar currency to the Bank of Brazil, and as has been reported
                            to the Department, the exchange rate at which American dollar currency
                            was liquidated surreptitiously declined considerably, making it
                            decidedly unprofitable for any legitimate holder of American dollar
                            currency to liquidate this currency other than through the procedure
                            outlined by the Bank of Brazil.</p>

                            have effectively isolated American dollar currency with Axis
                            connections. As has been reported to the Department substantial
                            quantities of American dollar currency are still in the possession of
                            Axis interests. As developments occur relative to this Axis control of
                            American dollar currency, they shall be reported to the Department.</p>

                            believed that a transfer of the gold to Buenos Aires might well result
                            in affording to the Axis powers additional means of acquiring foreign
                            exchange. This possibility appears to be even stronger in view of the

                            francs (275,000 contos), the funds to be credited to a special account

                                >Not printed.</note> The British Embassy in Washington has reported
                            to the Treasury Department that travelers by air from West Africa to the
                            United States via Brazil have been experiencing difficulty in meeting
                            expenses at Natal and Para through their inability to cash Sterling and
                            West African bank notes. The British Treasury has, therefore, suggested
                            to the West African Governors Conference, (consisting of Nigeria, the
                            Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and Gambia), that to surmount this difficulty
                            all travelers from West Africa by the above route should provide
                            themselves with dollar currency.</p>
                        <p>The United States Treasury Department would like to cooperate with the
                            British in this matter and to inform them that small amounts of dollar
                            currency will be converted in Brazil for travelers in transit to the
                            United States from West Africa. The maximum amount which each such
                            traveler would be permitted to convert under any such arrangement would
                            be $40 in United States currency.</p>
                        <p>Please discuss this matter with the appropriate Brazilian authorities and
                            inform the Department whether you believe the above arrangement is
                            satisfactory. You should keep in mind that if some such arrangement as
                            this is not established, it will be practically impossible for travelers
                            from West Africa to provide themselves with the means for settling minor
                            incidental expenses while en route. If <pb n="812" xml:id="pg_812"
                                facs="0824"/>you approve the arrangement, it would, of course, be
                            understood that amounts up to $40 could be liquidated locally by the
                            Bank of Brazil for each such traveler in transit between West Africa and
                            the United States via Brazil and that such currency would be handled in
                            the same manner as currency liquidated locally for United States and
                            Brazilian official personnel in accordance with the Department’s 2232,

                            <p>5. With reference to the attachment to your despatch No. 8571 please
                                bring to the attention of the Banco do Brasil that this arrangement
                                only covers checks drawn on the Treasurer of the United States
                                negotiated by it.</p>
                            <p>6. To minimize number of checks drawn on the Treasurer of the United
                                States, suggest you advise disbursing officers that they should
                                cable through their respective departments their local currency
                                requirements. Arrangements will then be made to advance dollar
                                credits to Banco do Brasil, Rio de Janeiro.</p>
                            <p>7. Please advise Banco do Brasil, Rio de Janeiro, and other United

                        <p>3303. Your 4324, October 21, 11 p.m.;<note n="79" xml:id="d790fn79">Not
                                printed.</note> your airgram A–390, October 1, 3 p.m. In view of the
                            increased activity in dollar transactions it is suggested that this
                            might be an appropriate time to take up with the appropriate Brazilian
                            authorities the question of prohibiting the holding of dollar currency
                            in Brazil. The issuance of a new regulation prohibiting the holding of
                            currency would probably stimulate the deposit of substantial quantities
                            of such currency. It is believed that such a prohibition would afford a
                            supplementary method of drying up the dollar market in Brazil and of
                            assisting these authorities in preventing the attempts being made by
                            residents in Brazil to avoid the effects of the new decree requiring the
                            conversion of Brazilian currency. The Department and Treasury have
                            always felt that a prohibition against the holding of dollar currency,
                            together with appropriate penalties for violation of such prohibition,
                            was a necessary part of an effective control over dollar currency.</p>
                        <p>In issuing any such prohibition Brazilian authorities should, of course,
                            provide that any dollar currency deposited with the Bank of <pb n="814"
                                xml:id="pg_814" facs="0826"/>Brazil as a consequence thereof be
                            forwarded to the United States on a collection basis for the account of
                            the depositor.</p>
                        <p>As far as the difficulties which such a prohibition might create with
                            respect to American and Brazilian traveling official personnel are
                            concerned, it is suggested that an administrative procedure, similar to
                            the one in effect at the present time, might be evolved to permit such
                            personnel to retain reasonable quantities of dollar currency which they
                            might have in their possession.</p>
                        <p>Please report to the Department the result of any discussions which you
                            may have with the Brazilian authorities on this problem.</p>

                                Attaché in Brazil and the Director of Exchange, Bank of Brazil, in
                                which the Embassy recommended that residents of Brazil who had
                                invested capital in meritorious enterprises and whose funds were
                                blocked be granted licenses to transfer the capital from the United
                                States to Brazil provided that an appropriate Brazilian agency would
                                ensure that the funds were used only for purposes mentioned in the
                                application (840.51 Frozen Credits/8118).</note> It is assumed that
                            you intend the suggested procedure to be applicable to applications by
                            residents of Brazil whose funds are blocked in the United States (which
                            would include Spaniards, Portuguese, Swiss, et cetera) and not to be
                            limited to applications by residents of Brazil whose funds are blocked
                            under Brazilian law (which presumably would only include Germans,
                            Italians and Japanese). It is not clear, however, from the enclosures to
                            the above despatch whether the Director of Exchange understands that the
                            procedure would be applicable to the broader class of applicants.</p>
                        <p>Please inform the Department whether you believe the Director of Exchange
                            clearly understands the scope of your proposal. The Department will then
                            attempt to work out the mechanics of the suggested procedure with the
                            Treasury.</p>

                            discussed with the Director of Exchange who is of the opinion <pb
                                n="815" xml:id="pg_815" facs="0827"/>that a law prohibiting the
                            holding of dollar currency might have some symbolical importance but
                            would be unenforceable.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy taking into consideration the troubles Brazil is having in
                            controlling its own currency tends to agree with this viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>It appears however that steps can be taken to prosecute persons engaging
                            in dollar transactions under a Decree Law enacted on November 27, 1933.
                            The Bank of Brazil has agreed to support the Embassy in the presentation
                            to the police of evidence which it has accumulated in regard to persons
