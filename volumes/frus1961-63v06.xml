                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102-138, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> Authorization
                    Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed by President <persName>George
                        Bush</persName> on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102-138 added a new
                    Title IV to the Department of State's Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC
                    4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government,
                    including facts that contributed to the formulation of policies and records that
                    provided supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of
                    concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not <pb n="IV"
                        xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0004"/>more than 30 years after the events recorded.
                    Although this volume records policies and events of more than 30 years ago, the
                    statute of October 28, 1991, allows the Department until 1996 to reach the
                    30-year line in the publication of the series.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major foreign policy
                    decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. It further requires that
                    government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    cooperate with the <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>Department of State
                    Historian by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign
                    policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. The
                    editors believe that in terms of access this volume was prepared in accordance
                    with the standards and mandates of this statute.</p>
                <p>The editors had complete access to all the records and papers of the Department
                    of State they deemed necessary to prepare this volume: the central files of the
                    Department; the special decentralized files ("lot files") of the Department at
                    the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the Department's Executive
                    Secretariat, which contain the records of international conferences and
                    high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders by the President
                    and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between the President and
                    Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic
                    posts.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also had full
                    access to the papers of President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>
                    and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and

                    and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>All of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of these
                    agencies, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the cooperation and
                    support of the National Archives and Records Administration. The List of
                    Sources, pages XVII-XVIII, lists the particular files and collections consulted

                <p>The editors have sought to present in this volume all the correspondence between

                    messages exchanged directly between the two leaders through the Soviet Embassy
                    in Washington or the American Embassy in Moscow. Also included are those oral

                    Russian Foreign Ministry in 1995 and translated at that time. The editors have
                    provided annotation about the translations, the mode of delivery of the messages

                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed

                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the

                <p>The superpower rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was central
                    to the foreign policy of the administration of President <persName
                        corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>, and the editors of the Foreign
                    Relations series have recognized that centrality in the 25 printed volumes
                    presenting the official record of U.S. foreign policy during the
                        <persName>Kennedy</persName> years. The threat of Soviet expansion and
                    subversion of areas and relationships vital to the security interests and
                    well-being of the United States was the preeminent concern of the President and
                    U.S. foreign policymakers. The perceived need to counter aggressive Soviet
                    communism around the world dominated American foreign policy and dwarfed other
                    issues.</p>
                <p>Although mindful of how the Cold War overshadowed American foreign policy in the
                        <persName>Kennedy</persName> period, the editors of the Foreign Relations
                    series believe that the events and decisions comprising these relations are
                    better understood in the particular regional or topical contexts rather than as
                    part of a single continuum of U.S.-Soviet relations. The editors decided to
                    maintain the long-standing structure of the series, which took account of the
                    major geographical regions defining U.S. foreign policy and presented
                    documentation that reflected American interests and involvements in those
                    regions. The Foreign Relations subseries for the <persName>Kennedy</persName>
                    years, 1961-1963, therefore seeks to reflect the emphatic preoccupation of
                    policymakers with U.S.-Soviet relations around the globe, while retaining much
                    of the geographical-topical structure of the series carried over from earlier
                    subseries of volumes documenting the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                        >Eisenhower</persName>,Truman, and Roosevelt presidencies.</p>
                <p>Eight of the 25 volumes (<ref target="frus1961-63v05">V</ref>, <ref

                        >XXIV</ref>) set forth the core documentation on the major aspects of
                    U.S.-Soviet relations and conflicts: the basic bilateral relations highlighted
                    by the summit meeting in June 1961, the exchanges of messages between President
                        <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> and Chairman <persName
                        corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, the efforts at arms control, the
                    basic elements of national security policy, the October 1962 Cuban missile
                    crisis, negotiations and plans arising from the threat of war over Berlin, and
                    the threat of hostilities by Soviet-supported forces in Laos. U.S.-Soviet
                    confrontation and competition are also important elements in other volumes that
                    document U.S. policies toward Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, regional
                    crises in South Asia, Yemen, and the Congo, and the deepening civil war in
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>In <ref target="frus1961-63v05">Volume V</ref>, Soviet Union, scheduled for
                    publication in 1997, the editors sought to bring together the main strands of
                    U.S.-Soviet relations during President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1"
                        >Kennedy</persName>'s administration, but without printing there the
                    complete record. The record of the major aspects and negotiations in U.S.-Soviet
                    relations during the <persName>Kennedy</persName> administration as collected by
                        <pb n="X" xml:id="pg_X" facs="0010"/>the editors of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series totals nearly 3,000 documents. The essential
                    detailed documentation on the major issues and crises in relations with the
                    Soviet Union is presented in depth in the appropriate regional and topical
                    volumes. Therefore, the high points in the record of the political skirmishes
                    between the United States and the Soviet Union around the world and the
                    evolution of strategic doctrines and arms control undertakings are identified or
                    summarized in editorial notes in <ref target="frus1961-63v05">Volume V</ref> so
                    that readers can recognize in one single volume the main lines of bilateral
                    U.S.-Soviet relations as well as the broad range of linkages in the
                    relationship.</p>
                <p><ref target="frus1961-63v06">Volume VI</ref> presents the complete correspondence
                    between President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> and Chairman
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. It is important for an
                    understanding of this critical phase in U.S.-Soviet relations that this
                    correspondence be collected and published in one volume rather than being
                    dispersed through six or more volumes of this Foreign Relations subseries where
                    particular issues considered by the leaders are relevant. The exchange of
                    correspondence obviously had its own internal coherence as well as periodically
                    addressing one or another of the ongoing crisis issues between the two nations
                    documented fully elsewhere in the series. The collected correspondence offers in
                    one volume a comprehensive overview of major Cold War problems and
                    possibilities.</p>
                <p>The correspondence between these two leaders was unique in a number of ways. It
                    gave rise to the first informal written exchange between Cold War leaders. Its
                    existence as a reliable, direct, and quick channel of communications was
                    instrumental in avoiding international catastrophe during the Cuban missile
                    crisis. It was a key early contributor to the learning process that over several
                    decades allowed leaders of the two nations to communicate with each other with
                    growing mutual understanding and eventually trust. In the field of arms control,
                    the exchange allowed President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>
                    and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> to haggle over
                    the details of an arms control agreement; in later years that function was
                    assumed by growing arms control bureaucracies and standing delegations. The
                    correspondence also showed clear differences in the personalities and leadership
                    styles of the two men, as well as the larger political cultures in which they
                    worked.</p>
                <p>This correspondence includes both formal and public exchanges as well as the more
                    informal and very confidential exchanges, transmitted through special
                    emissaries, which became known as the “pen pal" correspondence. The channel was
                    intended to give the two men a chance to exchange ideas in a “purely informal
                    and personal way,” as expressed by Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                        >Khrushchev</persName> in his letter of September 29, 1961. Some of the
                    informal messages were, however, made public immediately, sometimes before the
                    recipient received them, but most of the messages were declassified only in
                    later decades. The editors have indicated in the source footnotes <pb n="XI"
                        xml:id="pg_XI" facs="0011"/>if and when a communication was released to the
                    public if that information was found.</p>
                <p>The correspondence between President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1"
                        >Kennedy</persName> and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                        >Khrushchev</persName> presented the editors of the Foreign Relations series
                    with special problems. All of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                        >Khrushchev</persName> messages printed here are translations into English
                    of the original Russian texts, but it was not always apparent where or by whom
                    the translation was made. The editors have favored publishing the translations
                    seen at the time by President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> and
                    his advisers and have attempted to identify the source of the original
                    translation. Some of these texts were hastily translated and many contain
                    inaccuracies or errors. The editors have in a few cases indicated a more
                    accurate translation of words or phrases. The exception among these contemporary
                    translations is Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                    message of April 1, 1963, unavailable in U.S. sources, which was obtained from
                    the Russian Foreign Ministry in 1995 and translated in the Office of the
                    Historian at that time. The editors have also identified, to the extent
                    possible, the mode of transmission of the messages (whether delivered in Moscow
                    to the U.S. Embassy or transmitted by Soviet authorities in Moscow to the Soviet
                    Embassy in Washington for translation) to the President or one of his
                    advisers.</p>
                <p>Both the records gathered at the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">John F.
                        Kennedy</persName> Presidential Library and those of the Department of State
                    include collections of this correspondence between President <persName
                        corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> and Chairman <persName
                        corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. None of these collections is
                    complete. A few of the exchanges included here were not formal messages between
                    the two leaders but were communications passed through “back channels" by Soviet
                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Anatoly Dobrynin</persName> or other
                    Soviet officials to other members of President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1"
                        >Kennedy</persName>'s official family. Eight of the communications were oral
                    messages of which a written record was made only after the fact. The editors
                    made every effort to find and include here all messages that passed between
                    President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> and Chairman <persName
                        corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, but considering the sometimes
                    informal and indirect nature of the channel, there may be others. The final
                    document in the volume is the message from the President's widow to Chairman
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                <p>Portions of some of the messages exchanged between the President and the Chairman
                    and printed in <ref target="frus1961-63v06">Volume VI</ref> are included in
                    other volumes of the subseries. The editors have done so to ensure that users
                    had immediate access to the relevant texts in the context of compilations
                    regarding complicated negotiations or regional crises between the United States
                    and the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>The editors shared their proposed collection of messages with the Russian Foreign
                    Ministry in advance of publication, consulted with the Ministry regarding the

                                the Department of State used a central indexed decimal file system
                                for a large part of its records. For this volume the most important
                                decimal files were: 611.61 (general U.S.-Soviet relations);
                                711.11/KE (President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName>); and 761.13: (Soviet Government). In February
                                1963 the Department of State changed to a subject-numeric central
                                file system, which divided records into broad categories within
                                which were subject and country breakdowns.</item>

                        to congratulate you on the occasion of your election to the high post of the
                        President of the United States.</p>
                    <p>We hope that while you are at this post the relations between our countries
                        would again follow the line along which they were developing in Franklin
                        Roosevelt’s time, which would meet the basic interests not only of the
                        peoples of the U.S.S.R. and the United States but all mankind which is
                        longing for deliverance from the threat of a new war.</p>
                    <p>I think you will agree that the eyes of many people are fixed on the United
                        States and the Soviet Union because the destinies of world peace depend
                        largely on the state of Soviet-American relations.</p>
                    <p>We have declared and declare our respect for the peaceable and gifted people
                        of the United States and we are ready to develop the most friendly relations
                        between the Soviet and the American peoples, between the Governments of the
                        U.S.S.R. and the United States.</p>
                    <p>We are convinced that there are no insurmountable obstacles to the
                        preservation and consolidation of peace.</p>
                    <p>For the sake of this goal we are ready, for our part, to continue efforts to
                        solve such a pressing problem as disarmament, to settle the German issue
                        through the earliest conclusion of a peace treaty and to reach agreement on
                        other questions, the solution of which could bring about an easing and
                        improvement of the entire international situation.</p>
                    <p>Any steps in this direction will always meet with the full understanding and
                        support of the Soviet Government.</p>
                    <p>I wish you fruitful activity in the responsible capacity of United States
                        President and prosperity to the American people.<note n="1" xml:id="d1fn1"

                        of peaceful science and for wishes for success in the new stage of the
                        exploration of the cosmos. In your speech of inauguration to the office of
                        President, and likewise in the message to Congress of January 30 you, Mr.
                        President, said that you would like for the Soviet Union and the United
                        States of America to unite their efforts in such areas as the struggle
                        against disease, mastering the cosmos, development of culture <pb n="5"
                            xml:id="pg_5" facs="0027"/>and trade. Such an approach to these problems
                        impresses us and we welcome these utterances of yours.</p>
                    <p>We consider that favorable conditions for the most speedy solution of these
                        noble tasks facing humanity would be created through the settlement of the
                        problem of disarmament. And we would like every country to make every effort
                        for the solution of this problem with the establishment of such a strict
                        international control under which no one could arm secretly and commit
                        aggression.</p>
                    <p>All agree to the fact that the solution of the problem of disarmament depends
                        to a great extent on agreement between the Soviet Union and the United
                        States of America. If we reached such an agreement, it would be a great joy
                        for all people on Earth and a great blessing for all mankind.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Chairman</hi>: I have had an opportunity, due
                        to the return of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                        >Thompson</persName>, to have an extensive review of all aspects of our
                        relations with the Secretary of State and with him. In these consultations,
                        we have been able to explore, in general, not only those subjects which are
                        of direct bilateral concern to the United States and the Soviet Union, but
                        also the chief outstanding international problems which affect our
                        relations.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0028"/>
                    <p>I have not been able, in so brief a time, to reach definite conclusions as to
                        our position on all of these matters. Many of them are affected by
                        developments in the international scene and are of concern to many other
                        governments. I would, however, like to set before you certain general
                        considerations which I believe might be of help in introducing a greater
                        element of clarity in the relations between our two countries. I say this
                        because I am sure that you are conscious as I am of the heavy responsibility
                        which rests upon our two Governments in world affairs. I agree with your
                        thought that if we could find a measure of cooperation on some of these
                        current issues this, in itself, would be a significant contribution to the
                        problem of insuring a peaceful and orderly world.</p>
                    <p>I think we should recognize, in honesty to each other, that there are
                        problems on which we may not be able to agree. However, I believe that while
                        recognizing that we do not and, in all probability will not, share a common
                        view on all of these problems, I do believe that the manner in which we
                        approach them and, in particular, the manner in which our disagreements are
                        handled, can be of great importance.</p>
                    <p>In addition, I believe we should make more use of diplomatic channels for
                        quite informal discussion of these questions, not in the sense of
                        negotiations (since I am sure that we both recognize the interests of other
                        countries are deeply involved in these issues), but rather as a mechanism of
                        communication which should, insofar as is possible, help to eliminate
                        misunderstanding and unnecessary divergencies, however great the basic
                        differences may be.</p>
                    <p>I hope it will be possible, before too long, for us to meet personally for an
                        informal exchange of views in regard to some of these matters. Of course, a
                        meeting of this nature will depend upon the general international situation
                        at the time, as well as on our mutual schedules of engagements.</p>
                    <p>I have asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> to
                        discuss the question of our meeting. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                            >Thompson</persName>, who enjoys my full confidence, is also in a
                        position to inform you of my thinking on a number of the international
                        issues which we have discussed. I shall welcome any expression of your
                        views. I hope such exchange might assist us in working out a responsible
                        approach to our differences with the view to their ultimate resolution for
                        the benefit of peace and security throughout the world. You may be sure, Mr.
                        Chairman, that I intend to do everything I can toward developing a more
                        harmonious relationship between our two countries.</p>

                        12:15 today.<hi rend="italic">Begin text</hi>:</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, I send you this message in an hour of alarm, fraught with
                        danger for the peace of the whole world. Armed aggression has begun <pb
                            n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0030"/>against Cuba. It is a secret to no one
                        that the armed bands invading this country were trained, equipped and armed
                        in the United States of America. The planes which are bombing Cuban cities
                        belong to the United States of America, the bombs they are dropping are
                        being supplied by the American Government.</p>
                    <p>All of this evokes here in the Soviet Union an understandable feeling of
                        indignation on the part of the Soviet Government and the Soviet people.</p>
                    <p>Only recently, in exchanging opinions through our respective representatives,
                        we talked with you about the mutual desire of both sides to put forward
                        joint efforts directed toward improving relations between our countries and
                        eliminating the danger of war. Your statement a few days ago that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> would not participate in military
                        activities against Cuba created the impression that the top leaders of the
                        United States were taking into account the consequences for general peace
                        and for the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> itself which aggression
                        against Cuba could have. How can what is being done by the United States in
                        reality be understood, when an attack on Cuba has now become a fact?</p>
                    <p>It is still not late to avoid the irreparable. The Government of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> still has the possibility of not allowing
                        the flame of war ignited by interventions in Cuba to grow into an
                        incomparable conflagration. I approach you, Mr. President, with an urgent
                        call to put an end to aggression against the Republic of Cuba. Military
                        armament and the world political situation are such at this time that any
                        so-called “little war” can touch off a chain reaction in all parts of the
                        globe.</p>
                    <p>As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, there should be no mistake about our
                        position: We will render the Cuban people and their government all necessary
                        help to repel armed attack on Cuba. We are sincerely interested in a
                        relaxation of international tension, but if others proceed toward
                        sharpening, we will answer them in full measure. And in general it is hardly
                        possible so to conduct matters that the situation is settled in one area and
                        conflagration extinguished, while a new conflagration is ignited in another
                        area.</p>
                    <p>I hope that the Government of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> will
                        consider our views as dictated by the sole concern not to allow steps which
                        could lead the world to military catastrophe.<hi rend="italic">End

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Chairman</hi>: You are under a serious
                        misapprehension in regard to events in Cuba. For months there has been
                        evident and growing resistance to the <persName corresp="#p_CRF1"
                            >Castro</persName> dictatorship. More than 100,000 refugees have
                        recently fled from Cuba into neighboring countries. Their urgent hope is
                        naturally to assist their fellow Cubans in their struggle for freedom. Many
                        of these refugees fought alongside Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CRF1"
                            >Castro</persName> against the Batista dictatorship; among them are
                        prominent leaders of his own original movement and government.</p>
                    <p>These are unmistakable signs that Cubans find intolerable the denial of
                        democratic liberties and the subversion of the 26th of July Movement by an
                        alien-dominated regime. It cannot be surprising that, as resistance within
                        Cuba grows, refugees have been using whatever means are available to return
                        and support their countrymen in the continuing struggle for freedom. Where
                        people are denied the right of choice, recourse to such struggle is the only
                        means of achieving their liberties.</p>
                    <p>I have previously stated, and I repeat now, that the United States intends no
                        military intervention in Cuba. In the event of any military intervention by
                        outside force we will immediately honor our obligations under the
                        inter-American system to protect this hemisphere against external
                        aggression. While refraining from military intervention in Cuba, the people
                        of the United States do not conceal their admiration for Cuban patriots who
                        wish to see a democratic system in an independent Cuba. The United States
                        government can take no action to stifle the spirit of liberty.</p>
                    <p>I have taken careful note of your statement that the events in Cuba might
                        affect peace in all parts of the world.<note n="1" xml:id="d10fn1">See <ref
                                target="#d9">Document 9</ref>.</note> I trust that this does not
                        mean that the Soviet government, using the situation in Cuba as a pretext,
                        is planning to inflame other areas of the world. I would like to think that
                        your government has too great a sense of responsibility to embark upon any
                        enterprise so dangerous to general peace.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0032"/>
                    <p>I agree with you as to the desirability of steps to improve the international
                        atmosphere. I continue to hope that you will cooperate in opportunities now
                        available to this end. A prompt cease-fire and peaceful settlement of the
                        dangerous situation in Laos, cooperation with the United Nations in the
                        Congo and a speedy conclusion of an acceptable treaty for the banning of
                        nuclear tests would be constructive steps in this direction. The regime in
                        Cuba could make a similar contribution by permitting the Cuban people freely
                        to determine their own future by democratic processes and freely to
                        cooperate with their Latin American neighbors.</p>
                    <p>I believe, Mr. Chairman, that you should recognize that free peoples in all
                        parts of the world do not accept the claim of historical inevitability for
                        Communist revolution. What your government believes is its own business;
                        what it does in the world is the world’s business. The great revolution in
                        the history of man, past, present and future, is the revolution of those
                        determined to be free.</p>

                        prepared the intervention,<pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0033"/>financed
                        its arming and transported the gangs of mercenaries that invaded the

                    <p>United States armed forces also took a direct part in the accomplishment of
                        the gangster attack upon Cuba. American bombers and fighters supported the
                        operations of the mercenaries who landed on Cuban territory, and
                        participated in the military operations against the armed forces of the

                    <p>Such are the facts. They bear witness to direct United States participation

                    <p>In your message you took the course of justifying, and even lauding, the

                        justify the organization of a military attack on Cuba, committed for the
                        sole reason that the way of life chosen by its people is not to the taste of
                        the ruling circles of the United States and the North American monopolies
                        operating in Latin America, by talk about the United States Government’s
                        adherence to the ideals of “freedom”. But, one may ask, of what freedom are
                        you speaking?</p>
                    <p>Of freedom to strangle the Cuban people with the bony hand of hunger through
                        the establishment of an economic blockade? Is that freedom?</p>
                    <p>Of freedom to send military planes over the territory of Cuba, to subject
                        peaceful Cuban cities to barbarous bombing, to set fire to sugar-cane
                        plantations? Is that freedom?</p>
                    <p>History records many cases in which, on the pretext of defending freedom,
                        peoples have been drowned in blood, colonial wars waged, and one small
                        nation after another taken by the throat.</p>
                    <p>In the present case, apparently, the United States Government is seeking to
                        restore to Cuba that “freedom” under which Cuba would dance to the tune of
                        her more powerful neighbour and foreign monopolies would again be able to
                        plunder the country’s national wealth, to wax rich on the sweat and blood of
                        the Cuban people. But it is precisely against such “freedom” that the Cuban
                        people accomplished their revolution when they threw out Batista, who may
                        have loyally served the interests of his foreign masters but who was a
                        foreign element in the body of the Cuban nation.</p>
                    <p>You, Mr. President, display concern for a handful of enemies who were
                        expelled by their people and found refuge under the wing of those who want
                        to keep the guns of their cruisers and destroyers trained on Cuba. But why
                        are you not concerned about the fate of the six million Cuban people, why do
                        you not wish to pay regard to their inalienable right to a free and
                        independent life, their right to arrange their domestic affairs as they see
                        fit? Where are the standards of international law, or even of simple human
                        morality, that would justify such a position? They simply do not exist.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0034"/>
                    <p>The Cuban people have once again expressed their will with a clarity which
                        should have left no room for doubt, even in the minds of those who prefer to
                        close their eyes to reality. They have shown that they not only know their
                        interests, but can stand up for them. Cuba today is not, of course, the Cuba
                        you identify with the handful of traitors who have come out against their
                        people. It is the Cuba of workers, peasants and intellectuals, it is a
                        people which has rallied round its revolutionary Government headed by the
                        national hero, <persName corresp="#p_CRF1">Fidel Castro</persName>. And,
                        judging from everything, this people received the interventionists in a
                        fitting way. Is not this convincing proof of the real will of the Cuban
                        people?</p>
                    <p>I think it is. And since this is so, is it not time for all to draw from it
                        the right conclusions?</p>
                    <p>As for the Soviet Union, we have stated on many occasions, and I now state
                        again, that our Government does not seek any advantages or privileges in
                        Cuba. We have no bases in Cuba, and we do not intend to establish any. And
                        this is well known to you, to your generals and your admirals. If, despite
                        this, they still try to frighten the people by fabrications about “Soviet
                        bases” on Cuba, that is obviously designed for consumption by simpletons.
                        But there are fewer and fewer such simpletons, and that applies also, I
                        hope, to the United States.</p>
                    <p>By the way, Mr. President, I would like to express my opinion concerning the
                        statements made by you and by certain other United States politicians to the
                        effect that rockets and other weapons could be installed on Cuban territory
                        for possible use against the United States.</p>
                    <p>The inference from this is that the United States has some alleged right to
                        attack Cuba, either directly or through the traitors to the Cuban people
                        whom you arm with your weapons, train on your territory, maintain with the
                        money of United States taxpayers and transport with the resources of your
                        armed forces, covering them from the air and the sea while they fight
                        against the Cuban people and their lawful government.</p>
                    <p>You also refer to some United States obligations to protect the Western
                        hemisphere against external aggression. But what obligations can possibly
                        apply in the present case? No one can have any obligations to defend rebels
                        against the lawful government of a sovereign State, such as Cuba is.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, you are setting out on a very dangerous road. Think of it. You
                        speak of your rights and obligations, and, of course, anyone can claim this
                        or that right. But then you will have to admit that other States, too, can
                        base their actions in similar circumstances on similar arguments and
                        considerations.</p>
                    <p>You allege that Cuba can lend her territory for actions against the United
                        States. That is your supposition, but it is based on no facts. We, on the
                        other hand, can already refer to concrete facts, not suppositions: in some
                        countries, bordering on the Soviet Union by land and sea, there are <pb
                            n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0035"/>at present Governments following a
                        policy that is far from reasonable, Governments which have concluded
                        military agreements with the United States and have made their territory
                        available for the establishment of American military bases. And your
                        military say openly that these bases are spearheaded against the Soviet
                        Union, as if this were not already sufficiently clear. So, if you consider
                        yourself entitled to take such measures against Cuba as the United States
                        Government has been resorting to lately, you must admit that other countries
                        have no lesser grounds for acting in the same way with regard to States
                        whose territories are the scene of actual preparations constituting a threat
                        to the security of the Soviet Union. If you do not want to sin against
                        elementary logic, you must obviously concede this right to other States. We,
                        for our part, do not hold such views. We consider that the arguments
                        advanced on this score in the United States constitute, not merely an
                        extremely free interpretation of international law, but, to put it plainly,
                        open advocacy of a treacherous policy.</p>
                    <p>A powerful State can of course always find a pretext for attacking a weaker
                        country, and then justify its attack by claiming that that country was a
                        potential menace. But is this twentieth-century morality? This is the
                        morality of the colonialists, of the brigands who once pursued precisely
                        such a policy. Today, in the second half of the twentieth century, it is no
                        longer possible to take the pirate morality of the colonialists as a guide.
                        We all see, today, how the colonial system is crumbling and becoming a thing
                        of the past. The Soviet Union, for its part, is doing everything to promote
                        this process, and we are proud of it.</p>
                    <p>Or take the United States actions with regard to China. What stand-ards of
                        law can be invoked to justify these actions? Everyone knows that Taiwan is
                        an inalienable part of China. This has been admitted even by the Government
                        of the United States, whose signature appears on the Cairo Declaration of
                        1943. But later the United States seized Taiwan—took, in fact, the road to
                        brigandage. The People’s Republic of China announced its natural aspiration
                        to reunite the territory of Taiwan with the rest of Chinese territory. But
                        how did the United States react to this? It declared that it would use armed
                        force to prevent reunification of this Chinese territory, seized by it, with
                        the rest of China. It threatens war if China takes any steps towards the
                        recovery of Taiwan. And this is being done by a country which has officially
                        recognized that Taiwan belongs to China! Is not this perfidy in
                        international relations? If such methods were to become the rule in
                        relations between States, there would be no place left for law. Its place
                        would be taken by lawlessness and arbitrariness.</p>
                    <p>So, Mr. President, your sympathies are one thing; but actions against the
                        security and independence of other peoples, taken on the basis of such
                        sympathies, are very much another. You may, of course, express your sympathy
                        with the imperialist and colonialist countries; that does <pb n="14"
                            xml:id="pg_14" facs="0036"/>not surprise anyone. For example, you vote
                        with them in the United Nations. This is a matter of your morality. But what
                        has been done against Cuba is no longer morality. It is gangsterism.</p>
                    <p>I should like to stress that if the United Nations is really to become strong
                        and fulfil the functions for which it was established—and at present this
                        Organization, unfortunately, is a body already infected by the bacilli of
                        colonialism and imperialism—the United Nations must resolutely condemn the
                        banditry undertaken against Cuba. And the point here is not merely to
                        condemn the United States. The important thing is that the condemnation of
                        aggression should be seen to be a precedent, a lesson which other countries,
                        too, might learn, so that aggression should never again be repeated. For if
                        we were to take the course of approving or even, simply, condoning the
                        morality of the aggressors, it could be adopted by other States as well, and
                        this would inevitably lead to military conflicts, any of which might result
                        in a third world war.</p>
                    <p>What you said in your last statement to the Press <note n="2" xml:id="d11fn2"
                            >Reference is to President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1"

                        simply claim, in fact, some right of yours to employ military force whenever
                        you find it necessary, and to suppress other peoples each time you decide
                        that their expression of their will constitutes “communism”. But what right
                        have you, what right has anyone in general, to deprive a people of the
                        possibility of choosing their social and political system of their own free
                        will? Have you never considered that other countries, too, might perhaps
                        advance a demand similar to yours and might declare that you, in the United
                        States, have a system which breeds wars and espouses an imperialist policy,
                        the policy of threats and attacks against other countries? There is every
                        ground for such accusations. And, proceeding from the principles which you
                        now proclaim, one could, apparently, demand a change in the internal system
                        of the United States. We, as you know, do not follow that road. We favour
                        the peaceful coexistence of all States, and non-interference in the internal
                        affairs of other countries.</p>
                    <p>You allude to Budapest. But we can tell you openly, without any allusions: it
                        is you, the United States, that crushed the independence of Guatemala by
                        sending your mercenaries there, as you are now trying to do with regard to
                        Cuba. It is the United States, and no other country, that still mercilessly
                        exploits and keeps in economic bondage the countries of Latin America and
                        many other countries of the world. This is known to all. And if, Mr.
                        President, your logic is to be followed, actions from without could
                        apparently be organized against your country too, to put an end forever to
                        this imperialist policy, the policy of threats, the policy of suppressing
                        the freedom-loving peoples.</p>
                    <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0037"/>
                    <p>As for your concern for the emigres expelled by the Cuban people, I should
                        like to add the following. You are of course well aware that there are, in
                        many countries, emigres who are dissatisfied with the situation and the
                        system existing in the countries from which they fled. And if the abnormal
                        practice were introduced, in relations between States, of using these
                        emigres, especially with arms in their hand, against the countries they had
                        fled from, it can be openly said that this would inevitably lead to
                        conflicts and wars. It would therefore be well to refrain from such
                        ill-advised actions. This is a slippery and dangerous road which can lead to
                        a new world war.</p>
                    <p>In your reply, you saw fit to touch upon certain questions unrelated to the
                        subject of my message to you, including the question—as interpreted by
                        you—of the historic inevitability of a communist revolution. I can only
                        regard this as an attempt to evade the main question—that of aggression
                        against Cuba. We are prepared, in appropriate circumstances, to exchange
                        opinions on the question of the ways in which human society develops,
                        although this question cannot be settled by debates between groups or
                        individuals, however high their position may be. The question of whose
                        system is the better will be decided by history, by the peoples
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>You, Mr. President, speak often and much of your desire that Cuba should be
                        free. But that attitude is flatly contradicted by all United States actions
                        with regard to this small country, let alone the latest armed attack upon
                        Cuba organized with a view to changing Cuba’s internal system by force. It
                        was the United States which nearly 60 years ago imposed on Cuba the
                        enslaving terms of the Havana Treaty and established its Guantanamo naval
                        base on Cuban territory. Yet the United States is the most powerful country
                        in the Western hemisphere, and no one in that hemisphere can threaten you
                        with a military invasion. Consequently, if you continue to retain your naval
                        base on Cuban territory against the clearly expressed will of the Cuban
                        people and its Government, it is because this base is designed, not to serve
                        as a defense against an attack by any external forces, but to suppress the
                        will of the Latin American peoples. It was established to fulfil the
                        functions of a gendarme, to keep the peoples of Latin America politically
                        and economically dependent.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States is now fulminating against Cuba. But this
                        indicates only one thing—your lack of trust in your own system, in the
                        policy pursued by the United States. And this is understandable, as it is a
                        policy of exploitation, a policy for the economic enslavement of
                        under-developed countries. You have no confidence in your own system, and
                        therefore fear that Cuba’s example may prove contagious for other countries.
                        But aggressive, bandit actions cannot save your system. In the historic
                        process of the development of human society, each people decides, and will
                        decide, its own destiny.</p>

                    <p>As for the Soviet Union, the peoples of our country settled this question
                        finally and irrevocably over 43 years ago. We constitute a socialist state.
                        Our social system is the most equitable of all that have so far existed,
                        because in our country all the means of production are owned by those who
                        work. That is indeed a contagious example, and the sooner the need to go
                        over to this system is realized, the sooner will the whole of mankind
                        achieve a really just society. By this very development, an end will be put,
                        once and for all, to war.</p>
                    <p>You, Mr. President, did not like it when I said, in my previous message, that
                        there can be no stable place in the world if anywhere war is aflame. But
                        this is really so. The world is a single whole, whether we like it or not.
                        And I can only repeat what I said: it is impossible to proceed by adjusting
                        the situation and putting out the flames in one area, and kindling a new
                        conflagration in another.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet State has always been a consistent defender of the freedom and
                        independence of all peoples. We naturally, therefore, cannot concede to the
                        United States any right to control the destinies of other countries,
                        including the countries of Latin America. We consider that any interference
                        by one State in the affairs of another—especially armed interference—is a
                        violation of all international laws and of the principles of peaceful
                        coexistence which the Soviet Union has invariably upheld since the first
                        days of its existence.</p>
                    <p>If it is now, more than ever before, the duty of every State and its leaders
                        not to permit actions which are capable of jeopardizing universal peace,
                        that applies with all the more force to the leaders of the great Powers. It
                        is this that I urge upon you, Mr. President.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government’s position in international affairs remains unchanged.
                        We wish to build our relations with the United States in such a way that
                        neither the Soviet Union nor the United States, as the two most powerful
                        countries in the world, shall engage in sabre-rattling or push their
                        military or economic superiority to the forefront, since that would lead to
                        an aggravation of the international situation, not to its improvement. We
                        are sincerely desirous of reaching agreement, both with you and with other
                        countries of the world, on disarmament and all the other questions whose
                        solution would promote peaceful coexistence, the recognition of every
                        people’s right to the social and political systems established by it,
                        genuine respect for the will of the peoples and non-interference in their
                        internal affairs. Only under these conditions can one really speak of
                        coexistence, for coexistence is possible only if States with different
                        social systems obey international laws and recognize the maintenance of
                        world peace as their highest aim. Only in that event will peace be based on
                        firm foundations.</p>

                        complications, creating a threat to peace, and to assure peaceful
                        co-existence and the peaceful development of our countries.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the international atmosphere has recently become somewhat
                        heated in connection with the well-known events relating to Cuba, and a
                        certain open falling out has taken place in the relations between our
                        countries. There is no need to repeat now what I have already said in the
                        name of the Soviet Government concerning the position of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> in the Cuban events.</p>
                    <p>Speaking frankly, we regret that these events took place in general. However,
                        we hope that the differences of opinion which have recently arisen will be
                        eliminated with time, that the relations between the Soviet Union and the
                        United States will improve if, of course, a mutual desire for this is
                        demonstrated. Now, as never before, it is necessary without losing time to
                        build and expand the bridges of mutual understanding with the help of which
                        it would be possible to improve relations between our countries, which, if
                        one speaks frankly, are still divided by a muddy stream of mistrust and
                        hostility born of the “cold war.”</p>
                    <p>I consider it necessary in this connection to emphasize especially our
                        positive attitude toward the opinion, which you expressed in your message,
                        about the necessity of deciding international problems and differences of
                        opinion between our countries by peaceful means. I think that the bilateral
                        exchange of opinions between the leaders of the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                            >USA</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, so
                        fruitfully carried out during the time of Franklin Roosevelt, can also now
                        contribute to the achievement of this aim to a significant degree. We also,
                        even as you, Mr. President, attach great significance to this. Indeed, the
                        question of easing international tension and consequently the creation of
                        favorable conditions for deciding virtually all important international
                        problems depends to an enormous extent on the improvement of Soviet-American
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> explained to me
                        your deliberation about the expediency of a personal meeting between us for

                        with you concerning the usefulness of such an exchange of views. I confirm

                        of the meeting which you have proposed, namely June 3-4 in Vienna, are
                        acceptable to me.</p>
                    <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0042"/>
                    <p>One of the problems which, as is apparent from the exchange of views, gives
                        rise to our mutual concern is the situation in Laos. The Soviet Union hopes
                        that at the International Conference in Geneva a peaceful and just solution
                        of this problem will be found. We consider that at the present time there is
                        every possibility to guarantee the establishment of peace in that region and
                        to spare the people of Laos as well as other peoples from the danger of the
                        broadening of the present conflict. For this it is necessary only to proceed
                        steadfastly along the indicated correct path, and not to undertake anything
                        which could lead to a complication of the international situation. If, on
                        the part of all participants of the conference there is revealed a sincere
                        desire for the creation of a truly neutral and independent Laos, I think
                        that from the moment of our meeting with you we could with pleasure state
                        that the settlement of the problem of Laos had become a fact.</p>
                    <p>There is also a series of other vitally important problems requiring
                        solution. Among these, first of all, is the problem of disarmament. You, Mr.
                        President, naturally are familiar with the views of the Soviet Government
                        and its concrete proposals on this question. Therefore, it seems to me that
                        there is no necessity to repeat all of these considerations in this letter.
                        I wish only to underline that according to our firm conviction a practical
                        implementation of disarmament is the most urgent and important problem in
                        the sphere of international life in our time. Speaking figuratively, the
                        solution of this problem could be compared to the seizure of the highest
                        height which has been unattainable up to this time by mankind, after which
                        it <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0043"/>would be significantly easier to
                        solve other unresolved problems. I should like to express the hope that our
                        meeting can create the necessary premises for the success of the bilateral
                        talks which are scheduled for June-July of this year between our countries
                        on the problems of disarmament. We would only welcome this.</p>
                    <p>There is another international problem which urgently requires a solution. It
                        is important both for the strengthening of peace in Europe and for the
                        support of general peace. This is the problem of a peaceful settlement with
                        Germany, including the question of Western Berlin. I believe that you have
                        at your disposal complete information concerning the views of the Soviet
                        Government in this regard. In conversations with your Ambassador, I have set
                        forth our position in complete frankness. It is to be hoped, Mr. President,
                        that you will approach this position with understanding: we do not demand
                        any unilateral advantages of any sort for ourselves. We propose a peaceful
                        settlement, which proceeds from the actually existing situation and which is
                        directed toward the liquidation of a dangerous source of tension in the very
                        heart of Europe. We seek only that finally the line should be drawn under
                        the Second World War. The signature of a peace treaty with Germany, I am
                        deeply convinced, would be a significant landmark in the improvement of
                        relations between our countries.</p>
                    <p>In your letter, you, Mr. President, speak of the fact that we should
                        recognize the fact that there are problems concerning which we cannot agree
                        and concerning which in our governments there can be a different point of
                        view. I agree with you. In the solution of international problems, large or
                        small, there are, and will be, not a few difficulties. But it is our task,
                        as heads of state, to strive to overcome them and to do everything possible
                        for the attainment of agreement concerning questions which are ripe for
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>I hope that at our forthcoming meeting we will be able to continue the
                        exchange of views both on problems which have been touched on in our letters
                        and on other problems and to indicate the path or, if you wish, the
                        direction for their further examination and settlement.</p>

                        Soviet people we send to the American people, and to you personally, our
                        sincere congratulations on the occasion of this important date in the life
                        of the American people, namely, the 185th anniversary of achieving their
                        independence. While sending our congratulations to you today, we want to
                        express the hope that the recent Vienna meeting, and the exchange of
                        opinions which took place there on questions of interest to both countries,
                        will further the mutual efforts of our governments directed to the urgent
                        solution of problems which long ago became pressing and which the last war
                        left to us after the defeat of the aggressors. History imposed on our
                        peoples, on their governments and on their leaders an enormous share of the
                        responsibility for the preservation of peace, for the future of humanity. In
                        order to carry out this great historical mission it is necessary to commence
                        building, from both sides, enduring bridges of trust, of mutual
                        understanding and of friendship. The Soviet Union has always striven and
                        strives now to achieve this aim. The Soviet and the American peoples by
                        right must go down in history as the two great peoples who made a decisive
                        contribution to the cause of ensuring permanent peace on earth.</p>

                    <p>I wish to thank you personally and on behalf of the American people for your
                        greetings on the occasion of the 185th Anniversary of the Independence of

                                18</ref>.</note> It is a source of satisfaction to me that on our
                        185th Anniversary the United States is still committed to the revolutionary
                        principles, of individual liberty and national freedom for all peoples,
                        which motivated our first great leader. I am confident that given a sincere
                        desire to achieve a peaceful settlement of the issues which still disturb
                        the world’s tranquillity we can, in our time, reach that peaceful goal which
                        all peoples so ardently desire. A special responsibility at this time rests
                        upon the Soviet Union and the United States. I wish to assure the people of
                        your country of our desire to live in friendship and peace with them.</p>

                    <p>On September 5, 1961, Cyrus Sulzberger met with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                            >Khrushchev</persName> and during an off-the-record conversation
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> gave him a message for
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>, emphasizing that
                        it was off-the-record. Sulzberger transmitted the following message to the
                        President on September 10: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>, At present I am on the shore of
                        the Black Sea. When they write in the press that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                            >Khrushchev</persName> is resting on the Black Sea it may be said that
                        this is correct and at the same time incorrect. This is indeed a wonderful
                        place. As a former Naval officer you would surely appreciate the merits of
                        these surroundings, the beauty of the sea and the grandeur of the Caucasian
                        mountains. Under this bright southern sun it is even somehow hard to believe
                        that there still exist problems in the world which, due to lack of
                        solutions, cast a sinister shadow on peaceful life, on the future of
                        millions of people.</p>
                    <p>But as you will fully understand, I cannot at this time permit myself any
                        relaxation. I am working, and here I work more fruitfully because my
                        attention is not diverted to routine matters of which I have plenty,
                        probably like you yourself do. Here I can concentrate on the main
                        things.</p>
                    <p>I have given much thought of late to the development of international events
                        since our meeting in Vienna, and I have decided to approach you with this
                        letter. The whole world hopefully expected that our meeting and a frank
                        exchange of views would have a soothing effect, would turn relations between
                        our countries into the correct channel and <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26"
                            facs="0048"/>promote the adoption of decisions which could give the
                        peoples confidence that at last peace on earth will be secured. To my
                        regret—and, I believe, to yours—this did not happen.</p>
                    <p>I listened with great interest to the account which our journalists Adjubei
                        and Kharlamov gave of the meeting they had with you in Washington.<note
                            n="1" xml:id="d21fn1">See <persName corresp="#p_SPEG1">Pierre
                                Salinger</persName>’s June 26 memorandum of conversation in <ref

                        interesting details and I questioned them most thoroughly. You prepossessed
                        them by your informality, modesty and frankness which are not to be found
                        very often in men who occupy such a high position.</p>
                    <p>My thoughts have more than once returned to our meetings in Vienna.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d21fn2">See <ref target="#d16fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                16</ref>.</note> I remember you emphasized that you did not want to
                        proceed towards war and favoured living in peace with our country while
                        competing in the peaceful domain. And though subsequent events did not
                        proceed in the way that could be desired, I thought it might be useful in a
                        purely informal and personal way to approach you and share some of my ideas.
                        If you do not agree with me you can consider that this letter did not exist
                        while naturally I, for my part, will not use this correspondence in my
                        public statements. After all only in confidential correspondence can you say
                        what you think without a backward glance at the press, at the
                        journalists.</p>
                    <p>As you see, I started out by describing the delights of the Black Sea coast,
                        but then I nevertheless turned to politics. But that cannot be helped. They
                        say that you sometimes cast politics out through the door but it climbs back
                        through the window, particularly when the windows are open.</p>
                    <p>I have given careful thought to what you told our journalists in your
                        personal talk with them and to the difficulties to which you referred. Of
                        course, I fully understand that the questions which have now matured and
                        require solution are not of the kind that easily lend themselves to
                        solution. But they have a vitally important significance for our countries
                        and for all the countries of the world. And therefore we cannot escape them.
                        We cannot shift the burden of solving those questions onto the shoulders of
                        others. And who else but the leaders of the two most influential and mighty
                        States—the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.—can the nations expect to work out
                        solutions which could form the basis for the consolidation of peace. After
                        your meeting with Adjubei and Kharlamov I was about to write you a letter
                        right then and, I admit, even drafted one. However, your television address
                        in July, <note n="3" xml:id="d21fn3">For text of the President’s radio and
                            television address to the American people, July 25, 1961, see <hi

                                1961</hi>, pp. 533-540.</note> unfortunately, made it impossible for
                        me to send that letter. After that speech which, putting it bluntly, <pb
                            n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0049"/>was belligerent in its nature, my
                        letter would not have been understood by you since it completely differed in
                        spirit, content and tone from what you said. After that we not only made
                        speeches and exchanged statements but, unfortunately, also proceeded to an
                        exchange of actions which will not, and indeed cannot, yield any moral
                        satisfaction either to you as President of the United States or to me as
                        Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R. Evidently both one side
                        and the other are compelled to undertake their actions under the pressure of
                        the various factors and conditions which exist and which—unless we exert a
                        restraining influence—will propel the development of events in a direction
                        in which you and I, and the more so the peoples of all countries, would not
                        like them to be propelled. It would be most of all unwise from the
                        standpoint of peace to enter into such a vicious circle when some would be
                        responding with counter-measures to the measures of others, and vice versa.
                        The whole world could bog down in such measures and counter-measures.</p>
                    <p>Lately I have had not a few meetings with eminent statesmen and political
                        leaders of Western countries. I have talked with Mr. Fanfani, the Prime
                        Minister of Italy. I shall not describe that talk of which I suppose he, as
                        a representative of a State allied with you, had informed you. Recently I
                        had a conversation with the former Prime Minister of France Mr. Paul
                        Reynaud. He raised a number of questions to which I frankly replied. After
                        Paul Reynaud I received Mr. Spaak, the Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime
                        Minister of Belgium, who for a number of years was the Secretary General of
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d21fn4"
                            >Amintore Fanfani visited Moscow August 3-5;Paul Reynaud September 15;
                            and Paul Henri Spaak September 19.</note> I listened to him with
                        attention and tried to reply to his questions as exhaustively as possible,
                        to expound our position and explain how we consider it best to solve those
                        questions. I must say that in my opinion understanding can be reached on
                        those questions which were touched upon in my talk with Mr. Spaak. To this
                        end it is only necessary that both sides should display equal interest in
                        settling the problems at issue on a mutually acceptable basis.</p>
                    <p>The statesmen of many countries are presently displaying great concern for
                        the destinies of peace, they are seriously troubled by the tense situation
                        that has taken shape and they sincerely fear that some rash actions might
                        bring the world to disaster and to the unleashing of nuclear war. These
                        feelings are dear to me and I understand them because, like many Soviet
                        people, I spent the war years at the front and lived through all the horrors
                        of war. I am against war. The Soviet Government is against war. The peoples
                        of the Soviet Union are against war. I say this to you because I believe
                        that you—a direct participant in the battles of the last war—take the same
                        position.</p>

                    <p>I should like in this connection to dwell upon some of the basic problems
                        which now preoccupy the whole world since the future of mankind depends on
                        their solution. It can be said that in the disarmament question which is the
                        major question of our time there have now appeared certain gleams.<note

                        General Assembly a “Statement of Principles”<note n="6" xml:id="d21fn6">For

                                1961</hi>, pp. 1091-1094.</note> as a joint proposal of the U.S.S.R.
                        and the U.S. so that in subsequent negotiations a treaty on general and
                        complete disarmament can be elaborated on its basis. Certainly it must not
                        be forgotten that so far this is an agreement in regard to the principles of
                        disarmament. This is as yet far from the achievement of the actual agreement
                        on general and complete disarmament, and the more so this is not the
                        practical start of such disarmament. But it is precisely the conclusion of
                        such an agreement and its implementation within the shortest possible time
                        that all the nations are expecting of us. For them and for all of us that
                        would mean great joy.</p>
                    <p>It is important to note that even understanding on the principles of
                        disarmament which we have succeeded in reaching after protracted and intense
                        effort and only after you came to the White House, is a good thing too.
                        Naturally such understanding is not an end in itself. It must, so to say, be
                        the harbinger, the first successful step on the road to general and complete
                        disarmament. That is what we would like to hope.</p>
                    <p>If, Mr. President, you are striving towards that noble goal—and I believe
                        that is the case—if agreement of the United States on the principles of
                        disarmament is not merely a diplomatic or tactical manoeuvre, you will find
                        complete understanding on our part and we shall stint no effort in order to
                        find a common language and reach the required agreement together with
                        you.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union, as you are well aware, has always advocated the prompt
                        implementation of general and complete disarmament. The solution of that
                        question would, in our profound conviction, radically promote the settlement
                        of other major international problems as well. Our position in that respect
                        is still unchanged.</p>
                    <p>But you will agree with me, Mr. President, that the present international
                        situation and its tension can hardly be assessed as a simple arithmetical
                        sum total of unsolved issues. After all, the series of measures and
                        counter-measures aimed at strengthening the armaments of both sides which
                        have already been put into effect by our Governments in connection with the
                        aggravation of the German question cannot be disregarded. I do not want here
                        to engage in an argument as to who is right or wrong in <pb n="29"
                            xml:id="pg_29" facs="0051"/>this matter. Let us leave this aside for the
                        time being. The main thing is that events are unfortunately continuing to
                        develop in the same unfavourable direction. Instead of confidence we are
                        turning to an even greater aggravation. Far from bringing the possibility of
                        agreement between us on disarmament closer, we are, on the contrary,
                        worsening the situation still further. That is another important reason why
                        the Soviet Union is now attaching such exclusive significance to the German
                        question. We cannot escape the fact that there has been a second world war
                        and that the problems we have inherited from the last war—first and foremost
                        the conclusion of a German peace treaty—require their solution.</p>
                    <p>History will not be reversed and West Berlin will not be moved to the other
                        side of the Elbe. In that war the peoples of our two countries fought
                        shoulder to shoulder. But if we fought together, we should indeed keep the
                        peace together.</p>
                    <p>If you were to come to the Soviet Union now—and this incidentally is
                        something I am hoping for—you would surely convince yourself that not a
                        single Soviet citizen will ever reconcile himself to the peace, which was
                        won at such great cost, being under constant threat. But that will be the
                        case until the countries that participated in the war recognize and
                        formalize the results of the war in a German peace treaty. Yes, that is what
                        our people are demanding, and they are right. That is demanded by the Poles,
                        that is demanded by the people of Czechoslovakia, that is demanded by other
                        nations as well. They are right too. The position of the Soviet Union is
                        shared by many. The impression is formed that understanding of the need to
                        conclude a German peace treaty is growing in the world. I have already told
                        you, Mr. President, that in striving for the conclusion of a German peace
                        treaty we do not want somehow to prejudice the interests of the United
                        States and their bloc allies. Neither are we interested in exacerbating the
                        situation in connection with the conclusion of a German peace treaty. What
                        need have we of such exacerbation? It is in the Western countries that they
                        create all sorts of fears and allege that the socialist States intend
                        well-nigh to swallow up West Berlin. You may believe my word, the word of
                        the Soviet Government that neither we nor our allies need West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>I do not doubt that, given good will and desire, the Governments of our
                        countries could find a common language in the question of a German peace
                        treaty too. Naturally in the solution of that question it is necessary to
                        proceed from the obvious fact, which even a blind man cannot fail to see,
                        that there exist two sovereign German States.</p>
                    <p>I was gratified to familiarize myself with the statement which, according to
                        press reports, was made by your representative in Berlin Mr. Clay on the
                        need to recognize that there now actually exist two Germanies. It is
                        impossible not to appreciate such a reasonable and sober pronouncement.<pb
                            n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0052"/>I recall Senator Mansfield made some
                        statements in the same spirit. All this warrants the hope that evidently the
                        process has started of a quest for a solution of the German question on the
                        basis of a realistic appraisal of the obtaining situation, a solution in
                        which the Soviet Union and the United States of America must, above all,
                        play their part. Naturally this solution must be such as not to inflict any
                        harm to the prestige of one side or the other.</p>
                    <p>If we fail to agree on the conclusion of one peace treaty for both German
                        States we also have at our disposal such a course as the drafting of two
                        treaties which would be similar in content—one for the German Democratic
                        Republic and the other for the Federal Republic of Germany. In that case the
                        States that were parties to the anti-Hitler coalition would have the
                        opportunity of signing one or two peace treaties depending on their choice.
                        Such an approach would allow of circumventing the difficulties that appear
                        owing to the fact that not all the possible participants in a peace
                        settlement are ready to recognize both existing German States legally and
                        establish diplomatic relations with them.</p>
                    <p>In any event the contracting parties could assume moral obligations to assist
                        in the unification into one entity of both German States if the Germans so
                        desire. It goes without saying that such obligations would find reflection
                        in the peace treaty itself. As for the achievement of agreement on the
                        unification of Germany, that is the concern of the Governments of the two
                        German States. I believe such a solution would be reasonable and
                        understandable for everyone. It would be understood by the German people as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>In signing a German peace treaty the States that participated in the war will
                        have to unconditionally recognize the presently constituted frontiers of the
                        German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Under the
                        peace treaty those frontiers would be legally formalized, I stress legally,
                        because defacto they already exist and cannot be changed without a war.</p>
                    <p>We cannot turn our back on the facts and fail to see that until the existing
                        borders of Germany are finally formalized the sluice-gates which release the
                        West German revanchist desires remain open. The followers of Hitler and his
                        policy who, unfortunately, still exist in no small numbers in the Federal
                        Republic of Germany are dreaming of the long-awaited day when, exploiting
                        the lack of a post-war settlement, they will succeed in bringing about a
                        collision between the U.S.S.R., the U.S. and the other former opponents of
                        Hitlerite Germany. Why then should we leave any ground for the activities of
                        those forces which are fraught with the threat of a world conflict? I would
                        think that the legal formalization of the State borders which have taken
                        shape after World War Two equally meets the interests of both the U.S.S.R.
                        and the United States. Thus the <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0053"
                        />borders that have taken shape and presently exist between the two German
                        States would be formalized as well.</p>
                    <p>There remains the question of West Berlin which must also be solved when a
                        German peace treaty is concluded. From whatever side we approach the matter,
                        we probably will not be able to find a better solution than the
                        transformation of West Berlin into a free city. And we shall proceed towards
                        that goal. If, to our regret, the Western Powers will not wish to
                        participate in a German peace settlement and the Soviet Union, together with
                        the other countries that will be prepared to do so, has to sign a treaty
                        with the German Democratic Republic we shall nonetheless provide a free city
                        status for West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Your statements, Mr. President, as well as the statements of other
                        representatives of Western Powers not infrequently show signs of concern as
                        to whether freedom for the population of West Berlin will be preserved,
                        whether it will be able to live under the social and political system of its
                        own choosing, whether West Berlin will be safeguarded against interference
                        and outside pressure. I must say we see no difficulties in creating such
                        conditions, the more so since the assurance of the freedom and complete
                        independence of West Berlin is also our desire, is also our concern. I
                        declare this on behalf of the Soviet Government, and on behalf of the
                        socialist countries allied with us which are interested in the solution of
                        the German question. I wish to emphasize in particular that the German
                        Democratic Republic and the Head of that State Walter Ulbricht are of the
                        same opinion. I say this with full knowledge and in all responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Voices can also be heard contending that it is not enough to codify in a
                        German peace treaty the guarantees of the freedom and independence of West
                        Berlin since—so it is said—there is no certainty that those guarantees will
                        be honored. The statesmen and political leaders of the Western Powers with
                        whom I have had occasion to meet, sometimes plainly expressed the wish that
                        such guarantees should not only be given under a peace treaty but should
                        also be specially reinforced by the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Frankly speaking it is hard to understand what such apprehensions are based
                        on. I am convinced that the guarantees established under a peace treaty will
                        be honored and observed by all the States which will have signed the treaty.
                        Furthermore the Soviet Union as a party to the German peace treaty will feel
                        itself responsible for the fulfillment of all the clauses of that treaty,
                        including the guarantees in respect to West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>But if it is the common desire that responsibility for the observance of the
                        status of West Berlin should be entrusted to the Soviet Union we shall be
                        ready to assume such a responsibility. I and my colleagues in the Government
                        have not infrequently given thought to the way in which <pb n="32"
                            xml:id="pg_32" facs="0054"/>the role of the Soviet Union in guarantees
                        for West Berlin could be implemented in practice. If we were simply to make
                        a statement that the Soviet Union will in some special way guarantee the
                        immunity of West Berlin, you will agree that this could prejudice the
                        sovereign rights of the German Democratic Republic and the other countries
                        parties to the peace treaty. In order to prevent that, in order not to
                        prejudice the prestige of any State—whether your ally or ours—I believe the
                        question should be solved in the way we have already proposed, namely that
                        token contingents of troops of the United States, the United Kingdom, France
                        and the Soviet Union, the four great Powers which participated in the war
                        against Hitlerite Germany, should be left in West Berlin. In my view that is
                        the sole possibility. Naturally such a system should be introduced not for
                        all time but for a specific period. Evidently an appropriate status for the
                        deployment of the troops of the four Powers in West Berlin would then have
                        to be devised which would be subject to the approval of the other countries
                        signatories of the peace treaty.</p>
                    <p>Given every desire, we could find no other solution which to any greater
                        degree would strengthen confidence in the reliability of guarantees for West
                        Berlin. If you have any ideas of your own on this score we are ready to
                        consider them.</p>
                    <p>Of course, such alternatives are also conceivable as the deployment in West
                        Berlin of troops from neutral countries or United Nations troops. I have
                        repeatedly expressed and now reaffirm our agreement to such a solution. We
                        also agree to the establishment of the United Nations Headquarters in West
                        Berlin which would in that case become an international city.</p>
                    <p>It goes without saying that the occupation regime in West Berlin must be
                        eliminated. Under the allied agreements occupation is a temporary measure
                        and, indeed, never in history has there been a case of occupation becoming a
                        permanent institution. But sixteen years have already elapsed since the
                        surrender of Germany. For how long then is the occupation regime to be
                        preserved?</p>
                    <p>A more stable status should be created for West Berlin than existed under the
                        occupation. If the occupation regime has lived out its time and has become a
                        source of strife among States it means the time has come to discard it. It
                        has completely exhausted itself, has become a burden in relationships among
                        nations and does not meet the interests of the population of West Berlin
                        itself. The transformation of West Berlin into a free city will create a far
                        more durable basis for its independent existence than the regime of
                        occupation. Furthermore the grounds for collisions among States which are
                        generated by the preservation of the occupation regime will disappear.</p>
                    <p>Of course, no one can be satisfied with half-measures which superficially
                        would seem to erase from the surface differences among States <pb n="33"

                        them under cover and driving them in deeper. What use would there be if we
                        barely covered up this delayed action landmine with earth and waited for it
                        to explode. Indeed, no, the countries which are interested in consolidating
                        peace must render that landmine completely harmless and tear it out of the
                        heart of Europe.</p>
                    <p>The representatives of the United States sometimes declare that the American
                        side is not advancing its concrete proposals on the German question because
                        the Soviet Union allegedly is not striving for agreed solutions and wants to
                        do everything by itself regardless of what other States may say. It is hard
                        for me to judge how far such ideas really tell on the actions of the United
                        States Government, but they are based on a profoundly mistaken assessment of
                        the position of the Soviet Union. The United States Government can easily
                        verify that, if it wishes to introduce its own constructive proposals at the
                        negotiations on a peaceful settlement with Germany incorporating the
                        question of West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>I am closely following the meetings of our Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Andrei A. Gromyko</persName> with the
                        Secretary of State of the United States Mr.<persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean
                            Rusk</persName>. I do not know how you will react to this idea, but it
                        seems to me that it would be useful to broaden contacts between our
                        Governments on the German question. If the United States Government, like
                        the Soviet Government, is searching for understanding and is ready to devise
                        conditions for peace with Germany which would be acceptable for both sides
                        and would not affect the interests or the prestige of any State I believe it
                        could be arranged that you and I would appoint appropriate representatives
                        for private meetings and talks. Those representatives would elaborate for us
                        the contours of an agreement which we could discuss before coming to a peace
                        conference where a decision on the question of a peace treaty with Germany
                        will be taken.</p>
                    <p>Your wish, Mr. President, that perhaps our Ambassadors in Belgrade should be
                        entrusted with an informal exchange of views, was communicated to me.<note
                            n="7" xml:id="d21fn7">Regarding the discussions in Belgrade between
                            Ambassadors Kennan and Yepishev, see <ref target="frus1961-63v14#pg_387"
                                >vol. XIV, p. 387</ref>.</note> In fact such meetings have already
                        started. Unfortunately, however, I see from the dispatches of our Ambassador
                        that they are spending too much time in, figuratively speaking, sniffing
                        each other. If this goes on the business will not move forward, whereas it
                        should be tackled with more energy.</p>
                    <p>I never met Mr. Kennan but, so far as I can judge by the press, he is, to my
                        mind, a man with whom preparatory work could be done, and we would
                        accordingly authorize our Ambassador. But evidently in that case our
                        Ambassadors would have to be given firm instructions to start talks on
                        concrete questions without needless procrastination and not merely <pb
                            n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0056"/>indulge in tea-drinking, not walk
                        round and about mooing at each other when they should talk on the
                        substance.</p>
                    <p>The following alternative is also possible. You, let us say, could send
                        someone in your confidence to Moscow under some plausible pretext and the
                        necessary contacts could be established there. This method might possibly
                        even expedite the solution of the questions. However, let the final choice
                        be up to you. You might perhaps prefer to charge Mr. Thompson, your
                        Ambassador in Moscow, with that mission. Personally I have had a number of
                        conversations with him and he gives the impression of being a man who can
                        represent you in dealing with the problems that face us. But naturally it is
                        not for me to give you advise in such matters. Please excuse me for
                        intruding in the sphere of questions which are entirely within your own
                        personal competence.</p>
                    <p>The non-aligned countries addressed messages to you, Mr. President, and to
                            myself.<note n="8" xml:id="d21fn8">Regarding these messages, see
                            American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1961, pp. 647-648.</note>
                        They suggested that we meet to discuss outstanding problems. You gave a
                        positive reply to that appeal. We too reacted favourably to the initiative
                        of the neutrals.</p>
                    <p>I believe a meeting between us could be useful and, given the desire of both
                        sides, could culminate in the adoption of positive decisions. Naturally such
                        a meeting would have to be well prepared through diplomatic or other
                        confidential channels. And when preliminary understanding is reached, you
                        and I could meet at any place in order to develop and formalize the results
                        of such an understanding. This would undoubtedly be met with great
                        satisfaction by all nations. They would see in that step an important
                        contribution to the settlement of existing differences, to the consolidation
                        of peace. The positive results of such a meeting would generate confidence
                        that all issues can be solved peacefully by negotiation.</p>
                    <p>We are proposing that a German peace treaty be signed not only to eliminate
                        the vestiges of World War Two, but also to clear the way for the elimination
                        of the state of “cold war” which can at any moment bring our countries to
                        the brink of a military collision. We want to clear the way for the
                        strengthening of friendly relations with you and with all the countries of
                        the world which espouse peaceful coexistence.</p>
                    <p>You, yourself, understand that we are a rich country, our expanse is
                        boundless, our economy is on the upgrade, our culture and science are in
                        their efflorescence. Acquaint yourself with the Program of our Party which
                        determines our economic development for twenty years to come. This is indeed
                        a grand and thrilling Program. What need have we of war? What need have we
                        of acquisitions? And yet it is said that we want to seize West Berlin! It is
                        ridiculous even to think of that. What would that <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35"
                            facs="0057"/>give us? What would that change in the ratio of forces in
                        the world arena? It gives nothing to anyone.</p>
                    <p>I often think how necessary it is for men who are vested with trust and great
                        power to be inspired with the understanding of what seems to be an obvious
                        truism, which is that we live on one planet and it is not in man’s power—at
                        least in the foreseeable future—to change that. In a certain sense there is
                        an analogy here—I like this comparison—with Noah’s Ark where both the
                        “clean” and the “unclean” found sanctuary. But regardless of who lists
                        himself with the “clean” and who is considered to be “unclean,” they are all
                        equally interested in one thing and that is that the Ark should successfully
                        continue its cruise. And we have no other alternative: either we should live
                        in peace and cooperation so that the Ark maintains its buoyancy, or else it
                        sinks. Therefore we must display concern for all of mankind, not to mention
                        our own advantages, and find every possibility leading to peaceful solutions
                        of problems.</p>
                    <p>When I was already closing this letter I was given the text of your address
                        before the United Nations General Assembly.<note n="9" xml:id="d21fn9">For
                            text of the President’s address before the U.N. General Assembly,

                                    Kennedy</persName>, 1961</hi>, pp. 618-626.</note> It has long
                        since become my habit, when reading statements by responsible statesmen, in
                        the first instance to search for and find—even a grain at a time—ideas and
                        propositions which could be useful for the building up of peaceful
                        cooperation among States. Almost involuntarily you sift away all the
                        accretions, all that has been said in a fit of temper, under the influence
                        of unduly inflamed passions. If everything is replied to in the same vein
                        such battles of words would have to be entered into that the voice of reason
                        would be drowned out and the shoots of all that is good and hope-giving in
                        relations among States would be nipped in the bud.</p>
                    <p>Of course, if one were to attune himself to an aggravation of relations
                        between our countries, your speech before the Assembly could easily be
                        evaluated as a challenge to an embittered dispute in the “cold war” spirit
                        and no one could reproach us as being partial. That speech contains no few
                        points in which homage is plainly felt to those who oppose the normalization
                        of the international situation and seek to whip up a military psychosis by
                        spreading all sorts of fables about the intentions of the Soviet Government
                        and ascribing to it what does not even exist. Hence, evidently, the crude
                        sallies tinted with ideological intolerance which are made against the
                        social and public foundations of socialist society and which look to me, if
                        the consolidation of peace is seriously contemplated, like a square peg in a
                        round hole.</p>
                    <p>If you are fighting for the preservation of capitalism and consider it to be
                        a more just society, we have our own opinion on that score. You <pb n="36"
                            xml:id="pg_36" facs="0058"/>speak of communism with disrespect, but I
                        could reply in kind with regard to capitalism. But can we change each
                        other’s mind in questions affecting our outlooks? No, to carry ideological
                        differences into relations among States is tantamount to an out-of-hand
                        renunciation of hopes of living in peace and friendship with each other and
                        we should certainly not take that road.</p>
                    <p>We can argue, we can disagree with one another but weapons must not be
                        brought into play. I recall our conversation in Vienna about peaceful
                        coexistence. I trust you will remember it and agree now, as you agreed then,
                        that the question of the choice of a social system is for the people of each
                        country to decide. Each one of us submits to his own principles, his own
                        system but this should not lead to a collision between our countries. Let us
                        allow history to judge the advantages of this or that social system.</p>
                    <p>A few words on Laos.</p>
                    <p>In your statement at the United Nations, Mr. President, you devoted attention
                        to the situation in Laos and voiced certain alarm. I believe that in Vienna
                        you and I worked out a fair basis for the solution of that question. The
                        Soviet Government is doing all that depends on it in order to put into
                        effect the understanding reached to the effect that Laos should become a
                        truly neutral independent State. In your speech at the United Nations,
                        speaking of Laos, you referred to the example of Cambodia and Burma. As we
                        have repeatedly stated, we agree that Laos should take the same road.</p>
                    <p>As I understand it, you, like ourselves, the Soviet Union and our allies,
                        agree that <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Prince Souvanna Phouma</persName>
                        should become the Prime Minister of the Government of Laos. But obviously
                        there are some difficulties in the question of the composition of the
                        Government. As is known, it was proposed to the Laotians that they include
                        in the Government eight followers of <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna
                            Phouma</persName>, four representatives of Pathet-Lao and four
                        representatives of Boun Oum. I was informed that the United States did not
                        object to that. Now, however, information is coming in that the American
                        Government seems to insist that of the eight posts given to the <persName
                            corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> group, three or four should
                        be filled by the representatives of Vientiane.</p>
                    <p>In this connection I should like to make several remarks, and I am asking you
                        to understand me correctly. You and I are being pushed towards engaging in
                        the selection of the personal membership of the Laotian Government. This
                        cannot fail to cause surprise. We would simply confuse the matter if we were
                        to attempt to suggest to the Laotians the names of those persons who should
                        be brought into the Government on behalf of these or those political groups.
                        The Soviet Government is not properly familiar with Laotian public figures
                        and, what is most important, it does not deem it possible to interfere in
                        questions which are exclusively <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0059"
                        />within the competence of the Laotians themselves. Let the three princes
                        decide the question.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> has won a certain
                        position in the country as a man of liberal leanings who advocates a policy
                        of neutrality for Laos. His desire to form a stable and viable Government is
                        natural and fully justified. <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna
                            Phouma</persName> will be justified in fearing the strengthening of both
                        the Pathet-Lao and the Boun Oum groups if they start claiming seats on the
                        Government for their representatives at the cost of the seats provided for
                        the group he himself leads. In our opinion, understanding should be
                        displayed towards the desire of <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna
                            Phouma</persName> to have a reliable support in the Government in order
                        to effectively govern the country and pursue the policy of neutrality.</p>
                    <p>If we could reach an understanding with you on this question on the basis of
                        the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of Laos <persName
                            corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> could, without doubt,
                        quickly form a Government. Naturally, in that case you and I could, by using
                        our influence on the corresponding quarters in Laos, give <persName
                            corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> the necessary
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>I note with gratification that you and I are of the same opinion as to the
                        need for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the territory of Laos. This
                        is an essential condition in order to provide Laos with the possibility of
                        consolidating itself as an independent State pursuing a policy of
                        neutrality.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet representatives in Geneva have been given instructions in the
                        spirit of the ideas described above. I hope your representatives will have
                        the same kind of instructions. This would promote the prompt conclusion of
                        the work of the Geneva Conference and the normalization of the situation in
                        Laos.</p>
                    <p>I am now working on the preparation of two reports which I shall deliver at
                        the Congress of our Communist Party: a progress report and a report on the
                        Program of the Party. Naturally, in those reports I cannot pass over such
                        questions as disarmament and the German question. These are the major
                        questions of the day because on their solution depends the course which
                        relations between our countries take in their development, and consequently
                        the course world events take: that is whether they will develop towards the
                        consolidation of peace and cooperation among States or whether they will
                        proceed in a different direction, a dangerous one for mankind. We want to
                        find the solutions of both these questions, we want to clear the road for an
                        improvement of relations between our countries, for the assurance of
                        peaceful coexistence and peace on earth.</p>
                    <p>Please convey my best wishes to your wife. I wish you and your entire family
                        good health.</p>
                    <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0060"/>
                    <p>I should like to believe that by joint effort we shall succeed in surmounting
                        the existing difficulties and in making our contribution to the solution of
                        the international problems which preoccupy the nations. And then together
                        with you we shall be able to celebrate the successes achieved in the
                        strengthening of peace, and this is something that the peoples of our
                        countries, as well as all men on earth, are awaiting impatiently.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Chairman</hi>: I regret that the press of
                        events has made it impossible for me to reply earlier to your very important
                        letter of last month.<note n="1" xml:id="d22fn1"><ref target="#d21">Document
                                21</ref>.</note> I have brought your letter here with me to Cape Cod
                        for a weekend in which I can devote all the time necessary to give it the
                        answer it deserves.</p>
                    <p>My family has had a home here overlooking the Atlantic for many years. My
                        father and brothers own homes near my own, and my children always have a
                        large group of cousins for company. So this is an ideal place for me to
                        spend my weekends during the summer and fall, to relax, to think, to devote
                        my time to major tasks instead of constant appointments, telephone calls and
                        details. Thus, I know how you must feel about the spot on the Black Sea from
                        which your letter was written, for I value my own opportunities to get a
                        clearer and quieter perspective away from the din of Washington.</p>
                    <p>I am gratified by your letter and your decision to suggest this additional
                        means of communication. Certainly you are correct in emphasizing <pb n="39"
                            xml:id="pg_39" facs="0061"/>that this correspondence must be kept wholly
                        private, not to be hinted at in public statements, much less disclosed to
                        the press. For my part the contents and even the existence of our letters
                        will be known only to the Secretary of State and a few others of my closest
                        associates in the government. I think it is very important that these
                        letters provide us with an opportunity for a personal, informal but
                        meaningful exchange of views. There are sufficient channels now existing
                        between our two governments for the more formal and official communications
                        and public statements of position. These letters should supplement those
                        channels, and give us each a chance to address the other in frank, realistic
                        and fundamental terms. Neither of us is going to convert the other to a new
                        social, economic or political point of view. Neither of us will be induced
                        by a letter to desert or subvert his own cause. So these letters can be free
                        from the polemics of the “cold war” debate. That debate will, of course,
                        proceed, but you and I can write messages which will be directed only to
                        each other.</p>
                    <p>The importance of this additional attempt to explore each other’s view is
                        well-stated in your letter; and I believe it is identical to the motivation
                        for our meeting in Vienna. Whether we wish it or not, and for better or
                        worse, we are the leaders of the world’s two greatest rival powers, each
                        with the ability to inflict great destruction on the other and to do great
                        damage to the rest of the world in the process. We therefore have a special
                        responsibility—greater than that held by any of our predecessors in the
                        pre-nuclear age—to exercise our power with the fullest possible
                        understanding of the other’s vital interests and commitments. As you say in
                        your letter, the solutions to the world’s most dangerous problems are not
                        easily found—but you and I are unable to shift to anyone else the burden of
                        finding them. You and I are not personally responsible for the events at the
                        conclusion in World War II which led to the present situation in Berlin. But
                        we will be held responsible if we cannot deal peacefully with problems
                        related to this situation.</p>
                    <p>The basic conflict in our interests and approach will probably never
                        disappear entirely, certainly not in our lifetime. But, as your letter so
                        wisely points out, if you and I cannot restrain that conflict from leading
                        to a vicious circle of bitter measures and countermeasures, then the war
                        which neither of us or our citizens want—and I believe you when you say you
                        are against war—will become a grim reality.</p>
                    <p>I like very much your analogy of Noah’s Ark, with both the “clean” and the
                        “unclean” determined that it stay afloat. Whatever our differences, our
                        collaboration to keep the peace is as urgent—if not more urgent—than our
                        collaboration to win the last world war. The possibilities of another war
                        destroying everything your system and our system have built up over the
                        years—if not the very systems themselves—are too <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40"
                            facs="0062"/>great to permit our ideological differences to blind us to
                        the deepening dangers of such a struggle.</p>
                    <p>I, too, have often thought of our meeting in Vienna and the subsequent events
                        which worsened the relations between our two countries and heightened the
                        possibilities of war. I have already indicated that I think it unfruitful to
                        fill this private channel with the usual charges and counter-charges; but I
                        would hope that, upon re-examination, you will find my television address of
                        July 25th <note n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">Reference is to a report by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> to the American
                            people on the Berlin crisis; for text, see <hi rend="italic">Public

                        your letter, although there may have been statements of opinion with which
                        you would naturally disagree. To be sure, I made it clear that we intended
                        to defend our vital interests in Berlin, and I announced certain measures
                        necessary to such a defense. On the other hand, my speech also made it clear
                        that we would prefer and encourage a peaceful solution, one which settled
                        these problems, in the words of your letter, “on a mutually acceptable
                        basis.” My attitude concerning Berlin and Germany now, as it was then, is
                        one of reason, not belligerence. There is peace in that area now—and this
                        government shall not initiate and shall oppose any action which upsets that
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>You are right in stating that we should all realistically face the facts in
                        the Berlin and German situations—and this naturally includes facts which are
                        inconvenient for both sides to face as well as those which we like. And one
                        of those facts is the peace which exists in Germany now. It is not the
                        remains of World War II but the threat of World War III that preoccupies us
                        all. Of course, it is not “normal” for a nation to be divided by two
                        different armies of occupation this long after the war; but the fact is that
                        the area has been peaceful—it is not in itself the source of the present
                        tension—and it could not be rendered more peaceful by your signing a peace
                        treaty with the East Germans alone.</p>
                    <p>On the contrary, there is very grave danger that it might be rendered less
                        peaceful, if such a treaty should convince the German people that their
                        long-cherished hopes for unification were frustrated, and a spirit of
                        nationalism and tension should sweep over all parts of the country. From my
                        knowledge of West Germany today, I can assure you that this danger is far
                        more realistic than the alleged existence there of any substantial number of
                        Hitlerites or “revanchists.” The real danger would arise from the kind of
                        resentment I have described above; and I do not think that either of us,
                        mindful of the lessons of history, is anxious to see this happen. Indeed,
                        your letter makes clear that you are not interested in taking any step which
                        would only be “exacerbating the situation.” And I think <pb n="41"
                            xml:id="pg_41" facs="0063"/>this is a commendable basis on which both of
                        us should proceed in the future.</p>
                    <p>The area would also be rendered less peaceful if the maintenance of the
                        West’s vital interests were to become dependent on the whims of the East
                        German regime. Some of Mr. Ulbricht’s statements on this subject have not
                        been consistent with your reassurances or even his own—and I do not believe
                        that either of us wants a constant state of doubt, tension and emergency in
                        this area, which would require an even larger military build-up on both
                        sides.</p>
                    <p>So, in this frank and informal exchange, let us talk about the peace which
                        flows from actual conditions of peace, not merely treaties that bear that
                        label. I am certain that we can create such conditions—that we can, as you
                        indicate, reach an agreement which does not impair the vital interests or
                        prestige of either side—and that we can transform the present crisis from a
                        threat of world war into a turning-point in our relations in Europe.</p>
                    <p>What is the framework for such an agreement? Detailed proposals must be a
                        matter of allied agreement on our side; and formal discussion must wait
                        further exploration of specific items. Your letter indicates, however, that
                        you are concerned over how protracted formal diplomatic negotiations can
                        become, with each side asking for the utmost at the outset, making more
                        statements to the press and using extreme caution in feeling out the other
                        side.</p>
                    <p>I agree with you that these letters should be able to supplement and thus
                        facilitate such negotiations. We are both practical men and these are meant
                        to be private, frank exchanges. I can tell you, for example, that I
                        recognize how difficult it would be to secure your agreement on a plan to
                        reunify Germany by self-determination in the near future (as desirable as I
                        think that is), just as you recognize that we could not be a party to any
                        agreement which legalized permanently the present abnormal division of
                        Germany. That is one reason why we could not be a party to a peace treaty
                        with the East Germans alone, even though, as I said at the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, we do not view as a critical issue the mere
                        signing by you of such a document. What is crucial, however, is the result
                        which you have asserted that such a signing would have with respect to our
                        basic rights and obligations.</p>
                    <p>I agree with the statement in your letter that our two governments must, in
                        one framework or another, continue our “obligations to assist in the
                        unification into one entity of both German states if the Germans so desire.”
                        While, as you point out, the method of achieving this goal is properly a
                        subject for discussion among the Germans themselves, this does not excuse us
                        from the responsibility we have assumed since the war to see the country
                        peacefully unified—and this is the reason why we cannot attempt any final
                        legalization as a formal international frontier of <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42"
                            facs="0064"/>the present line of demarcation between the Western and
                        Eastern zones. It also enjoins us against any action which would retard
                        movement across this line—although, not being “blind,” as you say, we cannot
                        fail to recognize that this line does exist today as the Western limit of
                        East German authority.</p>
                    <p>Whatever action you may take with East Germany, there is no difficulty, it
                        seems to me, in your reserving your obligations and our rights with respect
                        to Berlin until all of Germany is unified. But if you feel you must look
                        anew at that situation, the real key to deciding the future status of West
                        Berlin lies in your statement that the population of West Berlin must be
                        able to “live under the social and political system of its own choosing.” On
                        this basis I must say that I do not see the need for a change in the
                        situation of West Berlin, for today its people are free to choose their own
                        way of life and their own guarantees of that freedom. If they are to
                        continue to be free, if they are to be free to choose their own future as
                        your letter indicates in the phrase quoted above, I take it this includes
                        the freedom to choose which nations they wish to station forces there
                        (limited in number but with unrestricted access) as well as the nature of
                        their own ties with others (including, within appropriate limits, whatever
                        ties they choose with West Germany). Inasmuch as you state very emphatically
                        that you have no designs on West Berlin—and I am glad to have this
                        assurance, for it makes the prospects of negotiation much brighter—I am sure
                        you are not insisting on the location of Soviet troops in that portion of
                        the city.</p>
                    <p>Thus, although there is much in your letter that makes me doubtful about the
                        prospects in Germany, there are many passages which lead me to believe that
                        an accommodation of our interests is possible. But in our view the situation
                        should be peaceful now, and existing rights and obligations are already
                        clear. What is not clear is how any change would be an improvement. Your
                        letter and earlier aide-memoire, and Mr.<persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                            >Gromyko</persName> in his conversations with Mr.<persName
                            corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and myself, have made clear what you
                        would hope to gain by a change—a new status for the East German regime, a
                        settlement of frontiers, and relief from what you regard as potential
                        dangers in West Germany—but it is not clear how we in the West are to
                        benefit by agreeing to such a change. It is not enough to say there will be
                        a “free city” in a city that is already free—or that there will be
                        guarantees of our access when the old guarantees are still binding—or that
                        we can maintain token troops in a city when we have troops there now.</p>
                    <p>You are, as I said before, a practical man; and you can see that there is no
                        way in which negotiations on that basis could conceivably be justified on
                        our part. We would be “buying the same horse twice”—conceding objectives
                        which you seek, merely to retain what we already possess. I hope you will
                        give long and serious thought to this question—for the kind of “<pb n="43"
                            xml:id="pg_43" facs="0065"/>mutually acceptable” settlement you mention
                        is possible only if it brings actual improvements, from the standpoints of
                        both parties.</p>
                    <p>The alternative is so dire that we cannot give up our efforts to find such a
                        settlement. In the weeks ahead, while we are consulting on these matters
                        with our respective allies and you are meeting with your Party Congress, I
                        hope these efforts can continue—both through this correspondence and through
                        other contacts. Let us also both strive during this period to avoid any
                        statement, incident, or other provocation in Berlin which make a proper
                        negotiating climate impossible. For the present, I believe we can agree on
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> as a very
                        acceptable means of continuing the conversation. He knows of this letter; he
                        has my complete confidence, and I am glad that this channel is satisfactory
                        to you. He is in Washington at present, and will return to Moscow after our
                        inter-Allied talks are further under way.</p>
                    <p>As for another meeting between the two of us, I agree completely with your
                        view that we had better postpone a decision on that until a preliminary
                        understanding can be reached through quieter channels on positive decisions
                        which might appropriately be formalized at such a meeting. This reminds me
                        that your letter also very graciously stated your desire to have me visit
                        your country. If we can reach a reasonable settlement of Berlin and if the
                        international atmosphere improves, I would take great pleasure in such a
                        visit. I visited the Soviet Union in 1932 very briefly, and would look
                        forward to seeing the great changes that have occurred since then.</p>
                    <p>Let me make it clear that I do not intend to relegate the achievement of
                        complete and general disarmament to a place of secondary importance. I share
                        your conviction that nothing would do more to promote good will among
                        nations and contribute to the peaceful solution of other major disputes. Our
                        agreement on the statement of principles jointly submitted to the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly, while barely a beginning on
                        a matter where we remain far apart, at least holds out the hope that we may
                        someday achieve the final stage of such disarmament, verified to remove the
                        fears of any people that devastation may ever again be suddenly rained upon
                        them.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, however, our attention is urgently needed on those current
                        problems which keep the world poised on the brink of war. The situation in
                        Laos is one example. Indeed I do not see how we can expect to reach a
                        settlement on so bitter and complex an issue as Berlin, where both of us
                        have vital interests at stake, if we cannot come to a final agreement on
                        Laos, which we have previously agreed should be neutral and independent
                        after the fashion of Burma and Cambodia. I do not say that the situation in
                        Laos and the neighboring area must be settled before negotiations begin over
                        Germany and Berlin; but certainly it would greatly improve the
                        atmosphere.</p>
                    <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0066"/>
                    <p>It is now clear that <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Prince Souvanna
                            Phouma</persName> will become the new Prime Minister if an agreement can
                        be reached. But the composition of his government is far from settled, and
                        without assuming either the knowledge or the power to select individual men
                        for individual posts, you and I do have an obligation—if we are to reach our
                        goal—to continue, in your words, “using our influence on the corresponding
                        quarters in Laos” to make certain that <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna
                            Phouma</persName> is assisted by the kind of men we believe necessary to
                        meet the standard of neutrality. That standard is not met if the eight posts
                        assigned to Souvanna are filled in a manner which heavily weights the scales
                        in favor of one side or the other.</p>
                    <p>As you note, the withdrawal of foreign troops from the territory of Laos is
                        an essential condition to preserving that nation’s independence and
                        neutrality. There are other, similar conditions, and we must be certain that
                        the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> has the power and the flexibility to
                        verify the existence of these conditions to the satisfaction of everyone
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>In addition to so instructing your spokesmen at Geneva, I hope you will
                        increasingly exercise your influence in this direction on all of your
                        “corresponding quarters” in this area; for the acceleration of attacks on
                        South Viet-Nam, many of them from within Laotian territory, are a very grave
                        threat to peace in that area and to the entire kind of world-wide
                        accommodation you and I recognize to be necessary. If a new round of
                        measures and counter-measures, force and counter-force, occurs in that
                        corner of the globe, there is no foretelling how widely it may spread. So I
                        must close, as I opened, by expressing my concern over where current events
                        are taking us.</p>
                    <p>My wife who is here with me reciprocates your good wishes, and we return the
                        wish of good health to you and all your family. As I recall, I shall be
                        seeing your son-in-law <note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3"><persName

                    <p>I hope you will believe me, Mr. Chairman, when I say that it is my deepest
                        hope that, through this exchange of letters and otherwise, we may improve
                        relations between our nations, and make concrete progress in deeds as well
                        as words toward the realization of a just and enduring peace. That is our
                        greatest joint responsibility—and our greatest opportunity.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have read your letter of
                        October 16 <note n="1" xml:id="d23fn1"><ref target="#d22">Document
                            22</ref>.</note> with great attention. It is good that you had an
                        opportunity to write it in a quiet atmosphere, in your family circle, far
                        from the turmoil of the capital. I received your letter on the very eve of
                        the opening of the 22nd Congress of our Party, at a time when Moscow, and in
                        fact all of our country—was living an especially elated and exciting
                        life.</p>
                    <p>You have had probably an opportunity to get acquainted with the published
                        reports on the proceedings of the Congress and you can imagine how much
                        energy, time and attention on my part and on the part of my colleagues that
                        work required. The Congress has adopted a program of material and spiritual
                        development of the Soviet peoples’ life—a program unprecedented in its
                        scale.</p>
                    <p>However joyful it was to work out concrete plans for building communism in
                        our country we could not but think of today since it is vitally important
                        for us that these plans are carried out in the conditions of peace. That is
                        why so much attention was given at the Congress to international problems
                        and, first of all, to the security of peaceful coexistence of countries with
                        different social and political systems which has now been included as a
                        corner stone in the program of our Party. Our present struggle against the
                        consequences of the cult of personality, is, if you wish, at the same time a
                        struggle for a consistent realization of the principles of peaceful
                        coexistence.</p>
                    <p>However I am not going to dwell especially on the importance of our Party’s
                        Congress. We may, of course, have a different point of view on this matter.
                        It would seem to be more difficult for us to come to a common view on this
                        point than on the German problem.</p>
                    <p>Now the Congress is over and my friends and I believe that it was quite a
                        success. Now I am able to reply to your letter and express my views on the
                        points you raised in it.</p>
                    <p>You ask what advantages the West would get if it agrees to the changes
                        resulting from the solution of the German problem. In your letter you even
                        gave a comparison asserting that the Soviet Union wants to trade an apple
                        for an orchard. I do not intend to argue that—such a comparison <pb n="46"
                            xml:id="pg_46" facs="0068"/>might be good by its picturesquesness, but
                        in this case, I think, it is absolutely out of place.</p>
                    <p>What is the orchard which we are allegedly seeking, what is meant by that and
                        what is the apple which, as you say, we are suggesting to trade? Let us
                        consider it.</p>
                    <p>Let us look first at the proposals of the Soviet Union. The proposals, as you
                        know, are—to conclude a German peace treaty and on this basis to transform
                        West Berlin into a free city. Does the realization of these proposals
                        require any concessions on the part of the Western powers? No, and, once
                        again, no. The Soviet draft peace treaty is based only on the necessity to
                        consolidate and legalize the situation created as a result of the war, to
                        consolidate and legalize the German borders. Have another look at this draft
                        and you will see that we suggest to consolidate by this treaty what had
                        already been sanctified by the signatures which the leaders of our states
                        put in their time under the Potsdam agreement. We demand no changes in these
                        agreements.</p>
                    <p>This means that nobody gives anything and nobody takes anything from anyone,
                        and that the only point is to fulfill the obligations which the four powers
                        solemnly took upon themselves in Yalta and Potsdam.</p>
                    <p>Now, what is the position of the Western powers. If there is anyone who wants
                        to get the whole orchard giving nothing in return—that is you and your
                        allies. Let me show this with the facts.</p>
                    <p>It was stated in the Potsdam agreements that Germany should not be armed,
                        that an end should be put forever to German militarism and revanchism. In
                        spite of that the United States, Britain and France have made West Germany
                        their ally, are arming it—and arming it rather intensively.</p>
                    <p>One cannot find a single line in the allied agreements which would allow to
                        regard West Berlin and West Germany as one entity. In reality the Western
                        powers as early as in 1948 introduced in West Berlin the West German mark
                        and even made attempts to spread the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        laws on this city. Together with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> the
                        Western powers are now actively using West Berlin against the Soviet Union,
                        the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries.</p>
                    <p>These facts alone show that the Western powers in their present demands are
                        stepping aside from the allied agreements and are seeking for themselves
                        such advantages which would have been unthinkable 16 years ago. But the list
                        of such facts does not end at this.</p>
                    <p>In 1945 the four powers pledged to do their utmost in order that Germany
                        would never be able to threaten its neighbours and the world peace. But now
                        West Germany with your assistance has acquired such strength that it is
                        openly encroaching on the territory of neighbouring countries and starting
                        to grasp its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies by arms and
                        feet.</p>
                    <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0069"/>
                    <p>It is not an exaggeration to say that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                        hinders also the US Government in the free conduct of the policy which the
                        latter believes to be reasonable and which corresponds to the interests of
                        your country as well as other countries. You and I have agreed to establish
                        and maintain contacts in order to search jointly for mutually acceptable
                        solutions to the German problem. But actually that has not been accomplished
                        yet. And we understand quite clearly that it is first of all <persName
                            corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> who resists it being zealously
                        supported by French President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me, that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>’s
                        position is rather accurately described by an allegory which is well known
                        among our people. Once a peasant, so the story goes, boasted that he would
                        go to the forest and catch a bear; he was warned that it was a dangerous
                        undertaking, that bear is a strong beast. Never mind, I’ll handle him, said
                        the peasant, and went to the forest. Some time has passed but the peasant
                        still has not come back. The people started looking for him. Where are
                        you?—they cried. The peasant cried back: I am here, I have caught a
                        bear.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>—Well, bring him here.</item>
                        <item>—He won’t go.</item>
                        <item>—Come here yourself.</item>
                        <item>—But he won’t let me go.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>More or less the same has happened to France.<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> embraced <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                            >Adenauer</persName> to lean on West Germany and to increase with its
                        help the weight of France in European affairs and, may be, even to try to
                        conduct the events in the whole world. It is an open secret that
                            <persName>de Gaulle</persName> considers himself to be the most
                        qualified person to determine the political destiny of Europe and not only
                        Europe. Actually it has turned out that West Germany has so squeezed
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> in her arms that he is
                        not able any longer to escape from the embrace. In fact France has been
                        forced to follow in the wake of the policy which is being carried on by
                        Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>.</p>
                    <p>That is why <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is saying now
                        not the things which are helpful for ensuring peace and, consequently,
                        helpful for France and other nations. But whatever pleases Chancellor
                            <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>.</p>
                    <p>There seems to be no need to go back to the question of how and why it has
                        happened that the Potsdam agreements remained to a considerable degree
                        unfulfilled and what effect this fact had on the situation in Germany and in
                        Europe as a whole. This has been stated more than once before. And life
                        itself demands that we should look forward, not backward. It is important
                        now to single out what brings us closer, what will help us to restore the
                        spirit of cooperation and goodwill which was characteristic of the relations
                        between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> during the hard years of war. In our
                        opinion this can be easier and better achieved by a mutually agreed solution
                        of the problem of a German peace treaty. The <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48"
                            facs="0070"/>Western powers not only would not have to sacrifice in any
                        way their interests, they would gain and, indeed, not less than the other
                        states.</p>
                    <p>To use your comparison, it can be said that by the conclusion of a German
                        peace treaty we would have planted an orchard the fruits of which would be
                        enjoyed by all the states, all the peoples.</p>
                    <p>It is true that we have to settle this problem in a rather unusual way. At
                        the time when the Potsdam agreement was being signed nobody could have
                        foreseen that two independent states, with different ways of life, would
                        emerge on the territory of Germany. However, it has happened. What can we
                        do? Should we use force so that Germany will again become united? But nobody
                        seems to be anxious to fight for this. President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1"
                            >De Gaulle</persName> told us frankly that France was not interested in
                        reunification of Germany. And one can understand his position since he fears
                        and, evidently, not without a reason, that a united Germany—if one has in
                        mind the basis for its unification which is advocated by <persName
                            corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>—would be a militarist state with
                        all its widely known distinctive habits.</p>
                    <p>The world public opinion has obviously no sympathy with the idea of
                        reunification of Germany. Such opinion prevails in France, Britain, in wide
                        enough circles of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and even in West
                        Germany itself.</p>
                    <p>The situation existing in Germany is recognized everywhere in the West, but
                        many persons prefer to keep silent. They do so, naturally, not because of a
                        desire to help the reunification of Germany, but because of dislike for the
                        way of life established in the German Democratic Republic. They do not like,
                        of course, the social and political system not only in the G.D.R., but in
                        other socialist countries as well, including, naturally, the Soviet Union.
                        However just as we are not free to establish our systems in capitalist
                        countries, the Western powers have no right to impose one or another way of
                        development on the socialist countries.</p>
                    <p>I fully agree with you that it would be useless to argue about the advantages
                        of our social systems. We will not find a common language here. That is why
                        the Soviet Government proceeds from the necessity of recognition of what
                        exists in reality; two German states and two systems in the world—capitalist
                        and socialist. Any other approach would inevitably lead us to collision, to
                        war.</p>
                    <p>We have got an impression that you also want to achieve a mutually acceptable
                        solution of the German problem which would not lead to the deepening of the
                        differences and, eventually, to collision between our countries.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion we have already passed the stage of sounding out each other’s
                        positions. We should now start solving problems, otherwise contacts and
                        negotiations will lead to nothing but marking time.</p>
                    <p>When I sent you my latest letter I hoped that we would use this line of
                        communication for concrete discussion of still unsettled issues and, first
                        of all, of the German peace treaty as the most complex and urgent <pb n="49"
                            xml:id="pg_49" facs="0071"/>one. If both of us departed from concrete
                        discussion and confine ourselves to repeating generalities our confidential
                        correspondence could have been substantially depreciated.</p>
                    <p>In my recent letter I tried to set forth in detail our position on concrete
                        questions and, I will not conceal, I expected you to do the same. There
                        were, it seemed to me, some grounds for that in the light of the discussions
                        which our Foreign Minister had had in New York and in Washington with you,
                        Mr. President, and with the US Secretary of State. We understand, of course,
                        that you needed some time to study and think over all that had been said.
                        That is why, having found no concrete suggestions in your letter, we
                        expected that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>
                        would state them on your instructions. So far this has not happened,
                        either.</p>
                    <p>A certain apprehension is caused by an obvious dissonance between realistic
                        notes which we hear while talking with American statesmen on questions of
                        Germany, and conservative, extremely negative comments on these talks, which
                        are published on the pages of influential newspapers in the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>I will not go back to a detailed statement of our position, and will dwell
                        only on the main points. When we talked with you in Vienna you said that the
                        question of Germany should be solved in such a way that the prestige of any
                        of our countries was not hurt. I agreed with you then and I agree with you
                        now. Indeed, the Soviet Union and the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>
                        are great powers and the matter of prestige is important to them. We
                        understand it.</p>
                    <p>But how the interests of the parties can be taken fully into account when the
                        goal is to draw a line under the past war? It is clear—by the conclusion of
                        a peace treaty on an agreed basis. The conclusion of a peace treaty is a
                        natural way of the completion of war which is accepted by both—civilized and
                        uncivilized peoples. Such a treaty makes it possible to juridically secure
                        the cessation of the state of war and, at the same time, to legalize the
                        changes which resulted from the war. It is in complete agreement with
                        considerations of prestige.</p>
                    <p>The signing of a German peace treaty would help to liquidate the state of
                        “cold war,” to create better conditions for cooperation between our
                        countries, for the development of trade, for the exchange of scientific
                        achievements etc. On the basis of the peace treaty the question of West
                        Berlin will be solved.</p>
                    <p>It was said that the time, suggested by us, for the conclusion of a peace
                        treaty sounds like an ultimatum and this hurts the prestige of our partners
                        in negotiations. We have, of course, made no ultimatum. But in order to
                        create the best possible conditions for the achievement of an agreed
                        settlement the Soviet Government has decided not to insist that the peace
                        treaty be signed by the end of this year.</p>
                    <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0072"/>
                    <p>We do not dictate any firm terms for the solution of the German question and
                        you probably know it well. The best way, in our opinion, would be the
                        signing of a peace treaty between all countries which fought against Germany
                        and the two German states which have appeared on the ruins of the Hitlerite
                        Reich and the normalization of the situation in West Berlin on this basis.
                        But it is also possible to sign two peace treaties—with West and East
                        Germany, and the texts of these treaties should not necessarily be
                        identical.</p>
                    <p>There is also a third possibility which I mentioned to Mr. Spaak—to agree
                        before signing a peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                        by the Soviet Union and other powers on the status of West Berlin and on the
                        indispensable solution of certain important questions of the post-war
                        settlement in Europe.</p>
                    <p>What could constitute a special agreement on West Berlin which would then be
                        annexed to a peace treaty and thus would acquire the full juridical force?
                        There can be, certainly, only one thing in it—again the status of a free
                        demilitarized city, in other words West Berlin must become independent
                        politically, live in accordance with its internal laws, freely without any
                        external interference, with the most widely developed ties with any state of
                        any continent.</p>
                    <p>The situation which has developed in that city is absolutely abnormal. You
                        yourself spoke about it as of a heavy heritage. Consequently it is necessary
                        to liquidate this “heritage” lest it—as an abscess—spoil the relations
                        between our countries and cause inflammation on a healthy body.</p>
                    <p>You do not need West Berlin if, of course, it is not considered as a base for
                        subversive activities against the socialist countries. And even in this
                        capacity it hardly justifies the hopes of those who would like to preserve
                        the vestiges of World War II in the center of Europe and to thoroughly drive
                        a wedge between great powers. Those, who think that it is possible to weaken
                        the socialist countries by organizing subversive activities from West Berlin
                        against them, are deceiving themselves. West Berlin does not fit for that
                        under present circumstances—it is a rotten basis. The preservation of the
                        situation which exists there can only generate conflicts and cause anxiety
                        in the world.</p>
                    <p>Recently, through Mr.<persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName>,
                        you yourself let me know of your concern with regard to the situation in
                        Berlin. I must say we were also grieved by the incidents which took place on
                        the border between West and East Berlin during the last ten days of October
                        and caused the tension that nobody wanted.</p>
                    <p>I would not like to go into polemics with you and, judging by your message,
                        you do not pursue this aim either. I think, however, that the latest
                        incidents could not have taken place if the American military authorities in
                        West Berlin would have shown more desire to act with due regard to the real
                        situation.</p>
                    <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0073"/>
                    <p>I cannot but agree with you that a period of relative moderation and calmness
                        is particularly necessary now. We regard with understanding such a sober
                        approach which will allow to concentrate on the solution of the problems
                        related to the German peaceful settlement and not to turn away our attention
                        to the settlement of—frankly speaking—secondary questions.</p>
                    <p>Your letter of October 16 can be understood in such a way that West Berlin is
                        the very orchard which the Soviet Union wants to get for itself. But for us
                        it is not an orchard, rather it is a weed of bur and nettle. We do not want
                        to walk into this weed, we have no business there. We do not need West
                        Berlin. Let West Berlin live and develop in the way its population wants. We
                        are ready to do everything to this end.</p>
                    <p>If Western powers have no hidden aims with regard to West Berlin, why can we
                        not agree, then, on transforming it into a free city? International
                        character could be given to the status of West Berlin as a free city by
                        registering it at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Such a solution
                        would not be detrimental to any side since it would be based on the
                        recognition of the existing social and political conditions in West Berlin.
                        The balance of power which has developed between the two world systems after
                        the war would not be changed as a result of the transformation of West
                        Berlin into a free city, and the watershed between them would remain in the
                        same place.</p>
                    <p>We could explain this decision to everybody and any sober-minded person would
                        understand it because he would realize that our countries really want to
                        liquidate the vestiges of World War II and clear the way for peaceful
                        cooperation among all nations.</p>
                    <p>But what do Western powers suggest to us? There is only one thing behind all
                        their statements about the adherence to the cause of freedom of West
                        Berlin—the desire to preserve the regime of occupation there at any price.
                        They insist that this regime should be preserved even after the signing of a
                        peace treaty. I am not a diplomat and can be completely frank: if it means
                        only to get a confirmation of occupation rights, then it will be difficult
                        to expect not only agreement but even negotiations themselves, since there
                        will be nothing to talk about. You have to understand that the Soviet Union
                        cannot agree to preserve and recognize the regime of occupation in West
                        Berlin, i.e. by its own hands to help Western powers violate after the
                        conclusion of a peace treaty the sovereignty of the German Democratic
                        Republic, its ally.</p>
                    <p>In essence, the present position of the Western powers reflects the same
                        selfish line which they followed in signing the peace treaty with Japan. At
                        that time the Western powers considered it possible to neglect the interests
                        of the Soviet Union and to conclude the peace treaty without it. Now they
                        “allow” us condescendingly to sign a peace treaty with the <gloss
                            target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> provided, however, that the regime of
                        occupation in West Berlin remains <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0074"
                        />intact. To agree to this would be not only the loss of our prestige but
                        the complete surrender.</p>
                    <p>We would prefer to conclude a German peace treaty together with the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and other participants of the
                        anti-Hitlerite coalition. It is our ardent desire. But if our efforts to
                        make the positions of the sides closer do not reach the goal, all the same
                        we will sign a peace treaty and will do it certainly not with the purpose of
                        securing the occupation rights of Western powers.</p>
                    <p>It would be the greatest fallacy to expect that these rights could be saved
                        by threats, that under the pressure the Soviet Union will eventually agree
                        to play the part of a permanent sentry guarding these rights. Despite all
                        the threats on the part of Western powers the Soviet Union will in no case
                        retreat from its principled position.</p>
                    <p>Certainly, if Western powers adopt unreasonable decisions, the consequences
                        will be extremely sad. I think that not only myself but you also wish that
                        the mankind will never taste such a bitter lot. In any case these
                        consequences, if they were caused, would not be graver for the Soviet Union
                        than for the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>. For the allies of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, which are comparatively small
                        countries, they will be especially tragic. Besides the voice of these
                        countries can be heard in fact only until the guns start talking. When it
                        comes to direct collision they will be even deprived of physical ability to
                        influence in any way the course of events, which will take place in case the
                        fatal line is crossed.</p>
                    <p>Let us throw away arguments of force and rely exclusively on the arguments of
                        reason. The threats are of no use to us, and I agree with you that we should
                        not talk the language of “cold war.” Such language only prevents us from
                        estimating the situation in the world soberly and seeking the solution of
                        questions which are equally disturbing to both of our peoples. Let us solve
                        these questions in such a way that dealing with them today we would know for
                        sure that the relations between our countries will become better tomorrow
                        and still better the day after tomorrow. This is what is expected from us,
                        you and me—the men invested with great trust and great powers—by all peoples
                        who value peace higher than anything else.</p>
                    <p>You ask me, who would guarantee that the rights and interests of West Berlin
                        will not be violated and propose that reliable international guarantees
                        should be given to the city. You, Mr. President, and your predecessors have
                        repeatedly made such statements and, naturally, you have bound yourself by
                        those statements before the American and West German public opinion as well
                        as before the public opinion of other countries. But we also are not against
                        guarantees. The Soviet Union and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                        have no secret plans with regard to West Berlin, and therefore we ourselves
                        propose that guarantees—and the most effective ones—should be given to
                        it.</p>
                    <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0075"/>
                    <p>Thus, we seem to agree with you that there should be guarantees for West
                        Berlin. And here again there are two possibilities. I have already told Mr.
                        Spaak and you about that. The Soviet position is known to you and the
                        Secretary of State also from what was said by the Minister of Foreign
                        Affairs of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. I want to give you a
                        short summary of our point of view: if the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                            >USA</gloss> is interested in our guaranteeing the status of West Berlin
                        together, the Soviet Union is ready to assume such obligation upon itself.
                        But it must be recognized that the Soviet Union will have equal rights and
                        equal responsibility which other powers—guarantors will have.</p>
                    <p>I have already written to you that the most realistic way out is that of
                        placing some symbolic contingents of troops of four great powers in West
                        Berlin. And if the troops of four powers are stationed there, the Soviet
                        Union, naturally, will bear the responsibility with regard to guarantees
                        equal to that of Western powers. Such measure will be understandable to
                        both—the allies of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and the allies of
                        the Soviet Union. It will not hurt the prestige of any power concerned. But
                        if you want to have your troops in West Berlin while there will be no
                        [sic]our troops there that will not be equal terms. You want us to be
                        guarantors on some other terms which are different from those of others, of
                        yours, but this is not realistic.</p>
                    <p>I know that in the West attempts are being made to interpret our proposal on
                        guarantees as an expression of a desire to penetrate into West Berlin and to
                        gain a foothold there. Believe me, Mr. President, we are not intruding into
                        West Berlin. Why should we have our troops there? I think that your troops
                        too are not needed in West Berlin. They are guarding themselves, and
                        somebody’s shadow.</p>
                    <p>I will not, probably, make a mistake if I say that in the question of keeping
                        troops in West Berlin prestige considerations are the main ones. Since you
                        believe it so important to keep the troops in West Berlin we are prepared to
                        make a concession. It is a definite concession on our part since the
                        occupation rights cease to exist upon signing a peace treaty and
                        discontinuing the state of war. But in order that this concession is not
                        interpreted as a retreat of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> under
                        the pressure of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>—and not under the
                        pressure of reason and expedience—our token troops should be also stationed
                        in West Berlin. What kind of troops, of what size? It is not very important.
                        It might be that the number of our troops will be substantially less but
                        under an agreement the Soviet Union must be in an equal position with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>. The Soviet Government wishes to
                        take into account the prestige of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>,
                        but we would like you also, Mr. President, to display an understanding with
                        regard to our prestige. We must mutually spare each other’s prestige. For
                        how long should the token troops remain in West Berlin? At present some
                        people are not quite sure as to how a free city would feel and whether its
                        relations with other <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0076"/>countries will
                        run smoothly. But if all the fears that are now being expressed allay, if it
                        turns out that there are no grounds, and we are sure that it is so, for
                        concern about the fate of West Berlin? Really, it would not be quite clear
                        why it is necessary to keep these token troops in the city forever. And so
                        we propose that an agreement on stationing token contingents of troops of
                        the four powers in West Berlin be concluded for a definite period of
                        time.</p>
                    <p>If our proposal on stationing the token contingents of troops of the four
                        powers in West Berlin is not acceptable and if you believe that it is really
                        necessary for guaranteeing purposes to keep the troops in West Berlin, well,
                        let them be the United Nations troops. Such a solution should not do any
                        damage to you or to us, France and Britain. The <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> troops will see to it that the order as defined by the
                        status of the free city is strictly observed. This would seem to be even
                        better than to keep the troops of the four powers in West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>I repeat: neither the troops of the four powers nor the United Nations troops
                        should perform any occupation functions. The situation has changed and so
                        another regime corresponding to the conditions of peace time is needed.</p>
                    <p>I know you are concerned with the question of access to West Berlin.
                        Moreover, you, it seems to me, are inclined to consider it as one of the
                        most important and hard to solve questions. I do not know whether I will be
                        able to dispel the uncertainties but I would like to emphasize with all
                        clarity that neither the Soviet Government nor the Government of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> intend to impose any restrictions on the
                        ties of West Berlin with the outside world or on the access to that city of
                        these or those states by land, sea and air.</p>
                    <p>If we propose that the order of maintaining these ties and of using all kinds
                        of communications going through the territory of the sovereign state—the
                        German Democratic Republic—should be the same as accepted everywhere both in
                        the socialist and in the capitalist countries, then, you will agree we do
                        not demand anything special, any limitations or concessions. If some other
                        order is established it would precisely mean creating a special
                        discriminatory regime with regard to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                        >GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Those who cling to the occupation regime in West Berlin would like,
                        evidently, the Soviet Union to assume the responsibilities of a traffic
                        policeman securing continuous and uncontrolled transportation of military
                        goods of the Western powers into West Berlin. Generally speaking no one
                        objects to an access to West Berlin, but naturally, this access should be
                        exercised with the consent of the country through whose territory the
                        communications of West Berlin run. And if the Western powers still want the
                        Soviet Union to perform the functions of a traffic policeman, then, they
                        need it in order not to have simply an access to West Berlin but the access
                        which rests on the occupation regime.</p>
                    <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0077"/>
                    <p>I will permit myself to give an example. At present the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> seems to intend to recognize the Mongolian
                        People’s Republic. How, one may ask, an American Ambassador is going to
                        reach this Republic if he does not obtain our or the Chinese People’s
                        Republic’s consent to go through the Soviet or Chinese territory? Is the
                            <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> going in this case also to disregard
                        the generally accepted international norms and threatening with force to
                        demand for itself exclusive privileges?</p>
                    <p>You will say, of course, look we do not demand it. It is true, the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> does not demand it. But why, then, do you
                        use a different approach with regard to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that the US Government does not want to sign a peace treaty
                        precisely because it feels its wrongness in the questions of the order of
                        access to West Berlin. It prefers, it seems, to retain for the future such a
                        position: we are not participants of the peace treaty, we have not signed
                        this treaty and therefore we retain with regard to West Berlin all our
                        rights resulting from the surrender of Germany and the establishment of the
                        occupation regime in West Berlin. But it will be clear to the entire world
                        that the Western powers are in the wrong here. The fact alone that 16 years
                        have passed since the war makes groundless all the talks about further
                        maintenance of occupation regime in West Berlin. Whatever turn the events
                        might take, further uncontrolled use of the territory of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will become impossible. And the point here
                        is, naturally, not the observance of appearances but the real respect for
                        the sovereign rights of states.</p>
                    <p>At the present time most of the passenger traffic and the overwhelming part
                        of commercial freightage between West Berlin and the capitalist countries
                        are carried out on the basis of agreements with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss>. It does not create any difficulties or interruptions of
                        the ties of West Berlin with the outside world. Therefore it is difficult,
                        frankly speaking, to find reasons which would justify the belief that the
                        situation may change for the worse after a peace treaty is concluded and a
                        free city is created. Rather, everything speaks in favor of the
                        opposite.</p>
                    <p>In the interests of clarity I would like to point out that in solving the
                        question of access as well as other questions with regard to West Berlin we
                        cannot agree that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> be placed in a
                        special privileged position, and we will never agree to it. The Federal
                        Republic of Germany should enjoy no worse and no better conditions than
                        other states.</p>
                    <p>At present the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> authorities are openly,
                        without any disguise using West Berlin for subversive activities against the
                            <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and other socialist countries. It is
                        first of all these illegal and dangerous intrigues that forced the socialist
                        countries to take defensive measures. And it goes without saying that we
                        will object to the continuation of such a hostile activity when the question
                        of normalizing the situation in West Berlin on the basis of conclusion of a
                        German peace treaty is being solved.</p>
                    <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0078"/>
                    <p>Incidentally, sometimes voices are heard—could not East Berlin be separated
                        from the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. I would like to note that this
                        kind of talk is simply not serious. The social and political system in the
                        German Democratic Republic and in East Berlin is one and the same. East
                        Berlin is the capital of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the seat
                        of the government of the Republic. Therefore, when they talk about a
                        separation of the capital of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> it is
                        not even a preservation of status quo, but a change, a breaking of the
                        political and social order. No one will allow that the established state
                        organism existing and developing on the same social and political basis be
                        destroyed. And one should think that this unreasonable proposal is being
                        made not in the interests of achieving an agreement.</p>
                    <p>It seems that some aspects of the access will have to be settled anew.
                        Whatever is said the allies have never concluded any agreements on
                        commercial and civil air transportation into Berlin and out of Berlin. Due
                        to our oversight such a transportation was put into effect arbitrarily. With
                        the conclusion of a peace treaty that will have to be corrected. Airlines
                        interested in maintaining traffic with West Berlin will have to have a
                        permission of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to fly over its
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, there are difficulties of a technical nature. How is the
                        air traffic with West Berlin going now? To land or to take off from the
                        airfields in West Berlin planes fly over the city. It is dangerous both for
                        the passengers and, especially, for the population over whose houses planes
                        fly to land and take off. And it is not without reason that airfields are
                        located outside city limits in all countries of the world. Such a practice
                        is prescribed by safety reasons. And if the old outdated practice is still
                        in effect in West Berlin this is explained only by specific conditions which
                        developed as a result of the war.</p>
                    <p>The government of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is prepared to
                        permit planes flying to West Berlin to land and take off on its airfields
                        located nearby which cannot be considered as worsening of the conditions of
                        access to West Berlin. This is not a far-fetched but quite an actual task if
                        one is to bear in mind that the intensity of air traffic will apparently be
                        increasing year in and year out.</p>
                    <p>If the token troops of the four powers are stationed in West Berlin, then,
                        the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and other Western powers will
                        probably insist on the right of free access to maintain communications and
                        to supply their contingents. I think that if it meant flights of a small
                        number of planes defined in an agreement of the four powers to satisfy the
                        needs of the token contingents of troops then the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss> government could agree to that. Apparently these troops
                        would retain those airfields which exist now.</p>
                    <p>It goes without saying that the German Democratic Republic should be given
                        guarantees to the effect that the air traffic will not be used against its
                        interests. An agreement could be reached that the four powers which would
                        have token troops in West Berlin would exercise mutual <pb n="57"
                            xml:id="pg_57" facs="0079"/>control on the border over their
                        transportation into and out of the city. The same control on a mutual basis
                        could be established also for all other military transportation including
                        those for the token contingents of the Soviet Union which would be stationed
                        in West Berlin as guarantors. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would,
                        probably, be satisfied with it. Being its ally we would perform in a sense
                        the functions of the government of the German Democratic Republic seeing to
                        it that the communications with West Berlin related to the stationing there
                        of the contingents of troops of the four powers should not be used in a way
                        harmful to it.</p>
                    <p>Such a procedure, as I see it, could not do moral damage to any of the
                        parties concerned.</p>
                    <p>I am setting forth these considerations in a preliminary strictly
                        confidential order and I hope that they will be met with understanding on
                        your part.</p>
                    <p>Dear Mr. President, I am writing not to argue with you or to try to play
                        better the next fall-back position as diplomats call it. I have stated to
                        you the first, second and third possibilities. To any of them which you
                        would consider suitable, we are ready to agree. If you have something else
                        to propose—also on the basis of a peaceful settlement—we would willingly
                        exchange opinions with you. But if you insist on the preservation of
                        inviolability of your occupation rights I do not see any prospect. You have
                        to understand, I have no ground to retreat further, there is a precipice
                        behind.</p>
                    <p>As an optimist, and they say an incurable one, I hope for the better and
                        believe that eventually the solution can be found or, as you write,
                        reconciliation of our interests is possible. And not only possible, it is
                        necessary, for the alternative is a quarrel between the two most powerful
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>The letter has come out a bit more extensive than I thought originally. But
                        what can one do—the question is complicated and important. You start writing
                        about one thing but some other thing has to be mentioned too.</p>
                    <p>I have already consumed much of your time therefore, probably, it would be
                        better if I write you another letter on other questions which you raised in
                        your letter.</p>
                    <p>I will allow myself to express again the hope that our frank, confidential
                        correspondence will help to overcome difficulties however complicated it
                        might seem now.</p>

                                ><ref target="#d23">Document 23</ref>.</note> and did not touch upon

                        like to express my thoughts concerning Laos and the situation in South
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>First of all, I must emphasize that with regard to the question of Laos I
                        proceed from the fact that as early as in Vienna both of us agreed on the
                        necessity to make our contribution so that Laos become a really independent
                        and neutral state. In addition, our governments have also agreed that a
                        coalition government should be formed in Laos headed by <persName
                            corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName>, on the basis of the formula
                        4-8-4. Now, to all appearances, the major obstacle has arisen in connection
                        with the solving of the task of forming the government.</p>
                    <p>Creation of the government by <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna
                            Phouma</persName> on the basis of granting 8 posts to the neutralists, 4
                        posts to the Pathet Lao and 4 posts to the Boun Oum group would allow to
                        have in Laos a government which would reflect the internal situation
                        existing in the country and which would be able to pursue a neutralist
                        policy in favor of which both the Soviet Government and the Government of
                        the United States have spoken. The recent agreement of the King of Laos to
                        naming <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> the
                        Prime-Minister and entrusting him with forming a coalition government gave
                        reasons to hope that the settlement of the Laotian problem is a matter of
                        the very near future. To be frank, that was what we expected.</p>
                    <p>However recent reports from Laos indicate that the efforts of <persName
                            corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> to form a coalition
                        government run into serious difficulties that, I would say, are hard to
                        explain.</p>
                    <p>It has come to our knowledge that from the American side pressure is being
                        exerted on <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> through the
                        Boun Oum-Nosavan group to include representatives of the Vientiane group
                        into the category of neutralists-supporters of <persName corresp="#p_SP2"
                            >Souvanna Phouma</persName>.</p>
                    <p>But, Mr. President, these are completely groundless claims and they endanger
                        the creation of a coalition government. Now a situation has developed when a
                        neutral Premier is denied a possibility to form a neutral government, and it
                        appears that the agreement reached on the composition of a coalition
                        government becomes entirely meaningless. Indeed a <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59"
                            facs="0081"/>question arises—what sort of a neutral Premier one would
                        make whose cabinet members are imposed upon him against his will, and what
                        kind of a neutral government it would be if it does not include people who
                        stand for a neutralist course in foreign policy? But this is precisely the
                        way to which those who want to bind <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna
                            Phouma</persName> by feet and hand during the formation of the
                        government are pushing.</p>
                    <p>The composition of the <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName>
                        government is a strictly internal matter of Laos. We should give <persName
                            corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> every opportunity to act in
                        such a way as he deems necessary proceeding from the agreement on the
                        representation of the three political forces in Laos and the interests of
                        securing true neutrality of his country.</p>
                    <p>When I was writing to you about the necessary to use your and my influence to
                        accelerate the solution of the problem of forming the Laotian government, I
                        did not mean at all that this influence would go so far that you and I would
                        be choosing ministers or aides for Premier Souvana Phouma. As I see it, our
                        duty is to use our influence in order to bring about as soon as possible the
                        formation of a coalition government neutral in the orientation of its policy
                        and this in its turn would make it possible to accomplish earlier the work
                        of the Geneva conference on Laos. In any case the Soviet representative at
                        this conference has all necessary instructions to contribute to a successful
                        conclusion of the conference.</p>
                    <p>Thinking over the situation that has now developed in Laos I have come to a
                        conclusion that the speediest settlement in Laos requires now that the
                        demand to include persons from the Vientiane group into the category of
                        neutralist ministers in the coalition government of <persName
                            corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> be withdrawn. It is
                        necessary to give up making pressure on <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna
                            Phouma</persName> and stop interfering with his carrying out the
                        agreement on forming a coalition government. Any other approach may only
                        lead to an increased tension in Laos and to a renewal of the military
                        conflict there which not only we but, judging by your repeated statements,
                        you too do not want.</p>
                    <p>The Boun Oum group has of late not only been hindering the forming of a
                        coalition government and refusing to hold a meeting of the three princes to
                        solve the still unsettled questions but has been organizing constant attacks
                        on the <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> troops and the
                        Pathet Lao armed forces. I presume, Mr. President, that you are well aware
                        of the facts in this connection. Thus, the continuous pressure on <persName
                            corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> and the activities of the
                        Vientiane group threaten to bring to nil the results which have already been
                        achieved in the negotiations in Geneva, turning Laos into a kind of almost
                        permanent source of international tension which, naturally, both of us
                        should not allow to happen.</p>
                    <p>Therefore I take the liberty to express anew the hope that you will use all
                        your influence to prevent the above mentioned undesirable consequences.</p>
                    <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0082"/>
                    <p>In your message, Mr. President, you also touch upon the problem of South
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>As far as I know, the cause of the present tension in South Vietnam is the
                        policy of merciless terror and mass reprisals carried on by the regime of
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> which has
                        absolutely no support among the people. And this is not only our opinion. I
                        think that you are informed even better than we are as to what kind of
                        regime it is and how it is viewed both within the country and abroad.
                        Realizing that it is doomed this regime resorts to force and repressions
                        against the people, exterminating physically all those who in one way or
                        another express their disagreement with the order introduced there. I think
                        that looking at facts soberly you cannot but agree that the present struggle
                        of the population of South Vietnam against <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo
                            Dinh Diem</persName> cannot be explained by some kind of interference or
                        incitement from outside. The events that are taking place there are of
                        internal nature and are connected with the general indignation of the
                        population at the bankrupt policy of <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo Dinh
                            Diem</persName> and those who surround him. This and only this is the
                        core of the matter.</p>
                    <p>In this connection I as well as many other people feel rightfully puzzled—how
                        one can support a man like <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo Dinh
                            Diem</persName> with his bloody regime who completely lost the respect
                        of the people? Yet, the United States Government supports him, giving him
                        economic and military assistance. And what does it mean to give military
                        assistance to such a regime? It means to assist this regime of terrorism
                        which managed to antagonize not only the population in the South of the
                        country but also its neighbours because of its aggressive policy.
                            Mr.<persName>Johnson</persName>, Vice-President of the United States,
                        paid a visit to <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>; quite
                        recently General Taylor visited South Vietnam. Some news agencies report of
                        the intention of the US Government to send American troops to South Vietnam.
                        I do not think that all this could contribute to the improvement of the
                        situation in this part of Southeast Asia. Sending troops to suppress
                        national-liberation movement in other countries is by no means a way that
                        corresponds to the interests of peace and, besides, what are the guarantees
                        that the American troops would not get tied up in South Vietnam. I think
                        that such a perspective is most real. But it is fraught with new
                        complications, and to the difficulties that exist now in the international
                        situation and that you and I are trying to overcome new difficulties would
                        be added to which, it think, neither you nor I can be sympathetic.</p>
                    <p>I am writing this letter to you, Mr. President, being entirely under the
                        impression of the results of the 22nd Congress of our Party. The Congress
                        confirmed once again before the whole world an unshakable desire of the
                        Soviet people to live in peace and friendship with all other peoples and to
                        develop relations with all countries including the United States on the
                        basis of peaceful coexistence. Guided by this we will continue to strive for
                        peace and friendship with all the peoples and countries. It is <pb n="61"
                            xml:id="pg_61" facs="0083"/>precisely with this aim in mind that I take
                        the liberty to frankly and straightforwardly express in this letter my
                        opinion on the two problems of interest to us. I hope, Mr. President, that
                        you will correctly understand that it is motivated only by my desire to
                        contribute to the settlement of the urgent international problems in the
                        interests of peace. I told you of this desire which reflects the very nature
                        of our foreign policy during our meeting in Vienna too.</p>
                    <p>I avail myself of this opportunity to convey to you, Mr. President, to your
                        wife and the members of your family my best wishes which are fully shared by
                        my wife Nina Petrovna.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Chairman</hi>: I have now had a chance to study
                        your most recent two letters on the German problem and on Laos and
                            Vietnam.<note n="1" xml:id="d25fn1"><ref target="#d23">Documents

                        you again about Germany and Berlin,<note n="2" xml:id="d25fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d26">Document 26</ref>.</note> but I do wish to give you my
                        thoughts about Laos and Vietnam as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>In writing to you, I am conscious of the difficulties you and I face in
                        establishing full communication between our two minds. This is not a
                        question of translation but a question of the context in which we hear and
                        respond to what each other has to say. You and I have already recognized
                        that neither of us will convince the other about our respective social
                        systems and general philosophies of life. These differences create a great
                        gulf in communication because language cannot mean the same thing on <pb
                            n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0084"/>both sides unless it is related to
                        some underlying common purpose. I cannot believe that there are not such
                        common interests between the Soviet and the American people. Therefore, I am
                        trying to penetrate our ideological differences in order to find some bridge
                        across the gulf on which we could bring our minds together and find some way
                        in which to protect the peace of the world.</p>
                    <p>Insofar as Laos is concerned, it has seemed to us that an agreement ought to
                        be possible if you share our willingness to see that country genuinely
                        neutral and independent, and are prepared to take, jointly, the necessary
                        steps to that end. I have explained to you quite simply and sincerely that
                        the United States has no national ambitions in Laos, no need for military
                        bases or any military position, or an ally. You have stated your interest in
                        a neutral and independent Laos which we assume means that you do not seek to
                        impose a communist regime upon Laos.</p>
                    <p>Considerable progress has been made in Geneva, although there are still some
                        points which ought to be clarified. Further progress there will depend upon
                        the composition of the neutral government in Laos itself through negotiation
                        among the Laotian leaders. It is true that the United States has agreed to
                        the formation of a coalition government to be headed by <persName
                            corresp="#p_SP2">Prince Souvanna Phouma</persName>, but it is not
                        accurate as you write that the formula four-eight-four derives from any
                        agreement between our governments. This formula was suggested by <persName
                            corresp="#p_SP2">Prince Souvanna Phouma</persName> himself. I can assure
                        you that the United States is not attempting to determine the composition of
                        such a government, and that we have most certainly not been exerting
                        pressure through the Royal Laotian Government in any respect. We have, in
                        fact, been pressing the leadership of the Royal Laotian Government to
                        negotiate these questions in good faith with <persName corresp="#p_SP2"
                            >Prince Souvanna Phouma</persName>. Our efforts in this direction,
                        therefore, correspond to the request contained in your letter as to how we
                        should use our influence.</p>
                    <p>I wish I could believe that Prince Souphanouvong is prepared to enter into
                        such discussions in a spirit of negotiation with a view to the creation of a
                        genuinely neutral government. Prince Souphanouvong has remained consistently
                        at a distance from these discussions. We are hopeful that <persName
                            corresp="#p_SP2">Prince Souvanna Phouma</persName> will show a
                        willingness to take the initiative now incumbent upon him to search for a
                        government which would be broadly representative of all elements in Laos and
                        sincerely committed to a policy of nonalignment. We shall continue our
                        efforts with the Royal Laotian Government for the achievement of this
                        objective and I can only venture to hope that you, for your part, will
                        likewise exert your influence in the same direction.</p>
                    <p>As to the situation in Vietnam, I must tell you frankly that your analysis of
                        the situation there and the cause of the military action which has occurred
                        in Southern Vietnam is not accurate. Precisely because of <pb n="63"
                            xml:id="pg_63" facs="0085"/>the visit of such Americans as Vice
                        President <persName>Johnson</persName> and General Taylor we are, as you
                        yourself recognize, well informed as to the situation in that country. I do
                        not wish to argue with you concerning the government structure and policies
                        of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>, but I
                        would like to cite for your consideration the evidence of external
                        interference or incitement which you dismiss in a phrase.</p>
                    <p>I would draw your attention to a letter sent by the Government of Vietnam to
                        the International Control Commission concerning the North Vietnam subversion
                        and aggression against Vietnam, dated October 24, 1961. I would urge that
                        you should read this document very carefully since it contains evidence of a
                        planned and consistent effort on the part of the DRV to overthrow by
                        violence the legitimate government of South Vietnam. I would like to add
                        that the evidence contained in this document is known to the United States
                        to be accurate and sober. Many more incidents of the type outlined in this
                        document could be deduced from our own experience and our own direct
                        knowledge. I might point out here that in effect from 1954, the signature of
                        the Geneva Accords, until 1959, the situation in Vietnam was relatively
                        tranquil. The country was effecting a limited recovery from the ravages of
                        the civil war from which it had just emerged. The Government enjoyed the
                        support of the people and the prospects for the future appeared reasonably
                        bright. However, in 1959, the DRV having failed in the elections which had
                        been held in Vietnam and in the attempt to arouse the people against their
                        legitimate government, turned to a calculated plan of open infiltration,
                        subversion, and aggression. During the Third Party Congress of the Lao Dong
                        Party the Secretary General Le Duan stated: “There does not exist any other
                        way outside of that which consists in the overthrow of the dictatorial and
                        Fascist regime of the American-Diemist clique in order to liberate totally
                        South Vietnam, with a view to realizing national unity.” As indicated in the
                        document to which I have referred, you will find this statement in the <hi
                            rend="italic">Nhan Dan, Hanoi Daily</hi> Number 2362 of September 6,
                        1960.</p>
                    <p>It is the firm opinion of the United States Government that Southern Vietnam
                        is now undergoing a determined attempt from without to overthrow the
                        existing government using for this purpose infiltration, supply of arms,
                        propaganda, terrorization, and all the customary instrumentalities of
                        communist activities in such circumstances, all mounted and developed from
                        North Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>It is hardly necessary for me to draw your attention to the Geneva Accords of
                        July 20-31, 1954. The issue, therefore, is not that of some opinion or other
                        in regard to the government of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo
                            Dinh Diem</persName>, but rather that of a nation whose integrity and
                        security is threatened by military actions, completely at variance with the
                        obligations of the Geneva Accords.</p>
                    <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0086"/>
                    <p>Insofar as the United States is concerned, we view the situation in which the
                        Republic of Vietnam finds itself with the utmost gravity and, in conformity
                        with our pledge made at the Geneva Conference on July 21, 1954, as one
                        seriously endangering international peace and security. Our support for the
                        government of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD2">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>
                        we regard as a serious obligation, and we will undertake such measures as
                        the circumstances appear to warrant. Since there is no semblance of any
                        threat to the DRV by the Government of Vietnam, it is clear that if the DRV
                        were honorably to discharge the obligations it undertook in the Geneva
                        Accords, the prospects for peace would be greatly improved. I would,
                        therefore, venture to suggest that you, as the head of a government which
                        was a signatory to the Geneva Accords, should use all the influence that you
                        possess and endeavor to bring the DRV to the strict observance of these
                        Accords. This would be a great act in the cause of peace which you refer to
                        as the essence of the policies of the Twenty-second Party Congress. If the
                        DRV were to abide by its obligations under the Geneva Accords, there would
                        be no need for the United States to consider, as we must at the present, how
                        best to support the Government of Vietnam in its struggle for independence
                        and national integrity.</p>
                    <p>I have written you frankly about Laos and Vietnam for a very simple reason.
                        Both these countries are at a distance from our own countries and can be
                        considered areas in which we ought to be able to find agreement. I am
                        suggesting to you that you use every means at your disposal to insure a
                        genuinely neutral and independent Laos, as those words are commonly
                        understood throughout the world, and to insure that those closely associated
                        with you leave South Vietnam alone. On our part, we shall work toward a
                        neutral and independent Laos and will insure that North Vietnam will not be
                        the object of any direct or indirect aggression. This would be a step toward
                        peace; I am reluctant to believe that there is any necessary alternative to
                        be imposed upon my country by the actions of others.</p>
                    <p>I am leaving for a few days for a visit to the western part of our country
                        and will be in touch with you on other matters when I return.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Chairman</hi>: I enjoyed very much my talk with
                        your son-in-law, Mr.<persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>.<note
                            n="1" xml:id="d26fn1">A transcript of this interview on November 25 is
                            printed in <ref target="frus1961-63v05">volume V</ref>; it was published
                            in Izvetiya on November 28 and was the first direct communication to the
                            Soviet people by a U.S. President.</note> His publication of the entire
                        transcript of our interview was, I believe, a useful step in promoting
                        better communications and public understanding among the citizens of our two
                        countries. I was glad to hear from Mr.<persName corresp="#p_AAI1"
                            >Adzhubei</persName> that you were in good health, having successfully
                        weathered the arduous proceedings of your Party Congress.</p>
                    <p>Having previously replied to your letter of November 10 on Laos and Vietnam,
                        I want to reply now to your letter of November 9 concerning Germany and
                        Berlin. Let me re-emphasize my strong desire that we not use this private
                        and informal channel of communication to repeat the usual arguments and
                        assertions normally reserved for public debates and propaganda. We should
                        try instead to identify more clearly our areas of disagreement and areas of
                        possible agreement on concrete matters presently before us.</p>
                    <p>Your son-in-law and I knew that there was little value in arguing over either
                        our different social systems or our different views of history; and thus we
                        largely avoided those subjects. Consequently I will save for a more
                        appropriate time and place my comments in answer to yours as to who armed
                        which part of Germany first, who violated the Potsdam agreements, why you
                        ended the four-power administration of all Berlin, who is now abusing their
                        presence in Berlin, or whether the Japanese Peace Treaty is a precedent for
                        a “treaty” with only part of Germany. Nor am I going to engage in a
                        characterization of personalities, a repudiation of what may have appeared
                        in some Western newspaper, or a repetition of the evidence which shows why I
                        believe West Germany to be incapable of threatening your security.</p>
                    <p>Let us clear aside in this exchange these differences of view that apparently
                        cannot be changed. And let us, to the extent possible, also refrain from
                        using labels or adjectives that each of us may interpret differently—such as
                        “occupation regime” or “free city”. Let us talk about our responsibility:
                        the actual situations we face now, and the concrete changes which might be
                        discussed to improve those situations. That is the only <pb n="66"
                            xml:id="pg_66" facs="0088"/>way in which this correspondence can be
                        meaningful—the only way in which we can make certain that we understand each
                        other clearly and can prevent the tide of events from slipping beyond our
                        control—and the only way, finally, in which we can achieve the lasting peace
                        we both so devoutly desire.</p>
                    <p>I was very serious in telling your son-in-law that our two nations have the
                        most to lose from war and the most to gain from peace. The program of
                        development which you outlined at your 22nd Party Congress, which was fully
                        described in our press, must necessarily be carried out, as you state in
                        your letter, under conditions of peace. The same is true of the programs I
                        am seeking from the American Congress—to improve our people’s health,
                        education, housing, recreation and welfare, for example, as well as general
                        employment opportunities and economic growth.</p>
                    <p>So, with peace as our goal, let us examine where we stand in more concrete
                        terms. After reading your letter I think it particularly important that you
                        should have my views on these important matters.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>(1)</label>
                        <item>Western forces are in West Berlin now—and they will remain there as
                            long as the people of West Berlin want them to remain. This is in
                            accordance with your own position that they must remain masters of their
                            own fate.</item>
                        <label>(2)</label>
                        <item>Soviet troops are not now in West Berlin, and would not in the future
                            be needed there to guarantee our access any more than they are needed
                            for that purpose now—and we could not under any circumstances agree to
                            their being stationed there. I gather that you are not insisting on this
                            and there does not seem to me, therefore, to be any need for us to
                            become involved in long discussions in this matter except as a part of
                            an all-Berlin solution.</item>
                        <label>(3)</label>
                        <item>Western rights of access to West Berlin preceded and are independent
                            of the Soviet Union’s creation of the present East German regime. Their
                            free exercise is a solemn obligation of the Soviet Government toward us.
                            Those rights should therefore be confirmed and respected by any
                            subsequent regime or any arrangement it purports to make. In no
                            circumstances can we permit these rights to be subjected to the
                            discretion of East German authorities, which might be subject to change;
                            and surely you can understand how that would only increase the chances
                            of unnecessary conflict.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>While you may refer to these rights as “occupation” rights, our presence and
                        access are not being imposed upon the West Berliners contrary to their will,
                        and it is the “vanquished” population which is in a position to protest
                        continuation of an occupation. Also, while these rights may not be
                        consistent with your concept of a “free city,” they do mean the city is and
                        will be free in the sense that the West Berliners are free to choose their
                        own future and their own protectors of that future. But whatever those terms
                        may mean in our different languages, these facts remain. <pb n="67"
                            xml:id="pg_67" facs="0089"/>And no treaty or other arrangement with the
                        East Germans can alter these facts, inasmuch as West Berlin has never been a
                        part of East German territory.</p>
                    <p>Consequently, when you propose to conclude with the East Germans a settlement
                        recognizing and consolidating the situation as it actually is, and as it was
                        created as a result of the war, you must surely agree that the present
                        status of West Berlin, including the access and presence of Western forces
                        and the absence of Soviet forces, is one of those situations—and that any
                        realistic settlement must therefore start with these facts.</p>
                    <p>I am certain that you, as a realist, recognize that we cannot permit West
                        Berlin to be separated involuntarily from the forces of the Western Powers
                        when it is wholly clear that this is what the people of that city want, that
                        these forces constitute a threat to no one, and that you are unwilling, as
                        stated in your letter, to permit East Berlin to be separated from what is
                        now called East Germany.</p>
                    <p>Let us instead agree on the two principles stated in your letter: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Let West Berlin live and develop in the way its population wants”
                                without “any restrictions on (its) ties with the outside world or on
                                the access to that city of these or those states by land, sea and
                                air.”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>If the people of West Berlin should ever decide that the presence of Western
                        forces was no longer necessary or desirable, those forces will leave,
                        without any loss of prestige. But should the people of West Berlin decide to
                        the contrary, that should involve no loss of prestige for you, since you,
                        too, have stated that they should be free to determine their own future. Nor
                        does this “violate the sovereignty” of the East Germans, if any, inasmuch as
                        West Berlin has, as I stated, never been a part of their territory, and
                        therefore our rights in that city, including our rights of access and your
                        responsibility therefor, cannot in any sense be terminated by any unilateral
                        arrangements made with the East Germans.</p>
                    <p>I do not mean to imply by this that the Three Western Allied Powers and the
                        Soviet Union cannot discuss a clarification and possible improvement of
                        access rights. This is entirely proper, and should, in my opinion, be an
                        important focus of any subsequent negotiations.</p>
                    <p>So let us avoid the dangers of unilateral actions, of dealing with one part
                        of Germany only, and of abandoning agreements and goals to which both of us
                        are legally committed. Instead let us explore together what we can do
                        together—what joint actions for mutual benefit might be taken to improve the
                        existing situation, without altering those situations that cannot now be
                        altered, and consistent with our joint commitment to ultimate German
                        self-determination. We have, as you point out, renounced force as a means of
                        achieving that goal—but we cannot renounce the goal itself.</p>
                    <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0090"/>
                    <p>You state in your letter that I have not given you any “concrete” suggestions
                        for the settlement of this matter. This is possibly true in a formal sense.
                        But I am actively exploring with our allies our preparations for useful
                        negotiations at the proper time. To enter into negotiations when under
                        threat or pressure is no more feasible for us than for you. In addition, to
                        enter into negotiations that might later collapse for lack of preparation or
                        unity would surely heighten the dangers to the peace. I think you understand
                        moreover, that this is not merely a question of American policy, but also
                        involves the intimate association we have with our Western European
                        Allies.</p>
                    <p>As you undoubtedly are aware, there has been some divergence of views among
                        the Western Powers on the form and timing of negotiations. There are those
                        who believe, as you have read, that there is such a gap between the
                        positions taken by the Soviet Union and the Western Powers that negotiations
                        would inevitably fail, and thus the situation would become even more
                        unsatisfactory and dangerous than it is today. My own view is that, while
                        there are serious divergences of opinion in regard to those matters before
                        us, they must be considered in serious and responsible discussion—and that
                        we should not permit the present situation, so fraught with the possibility
                        of an explosive incident, to continue without our taking every possible step
                        to ease the matter. I have expressed this view to the other Western
                        Powers.</p>
                    <p>I am, therefore, hopeful that shortly after the representatives of the
                        Western Powers have met in Paris this month we and you will be in a position
                        to sit down in an agreed and appropriate manner to attempt to reach a
                        solution that is mutually satisfactory to all.</p>
                    <p>I want to emphasize again that what best serves peace, not merely prestige,
                        must be our chief yard-stick. It is not the effect on Western prestige but
                        the effect on peace in your proposals that cause me concern—and I am
                        anxious, as you are anxious, that we find solutions “on a mutually
                        acceptable basis” which will preserve for years to come the peace we now
                        enjoy. While I regret that this letter cannot now be more precise as to
                        detail, I am hopeful that stating our views clearly on certain matters at
                        issue will help make such steps possible at an early date.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>, Within a short period of time I
                        had an opportunity to read two [of] your messages—one addressed to our
                        country and the other, a confidential one, to me personally.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d27fn1">The confidential message is <ref target="#d26">Document
                                26</ref>; the other message is the interview with <persName

                                >footnote 1, Document 26</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>I want to express appreciation for those kind words and wishes which were
                        addressed by you to me in the talk with <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">A.I.
                            Adzhubei</persName>. I am satisfied, as you are, that this interesting
                        interview has taken place and would like to hope, together with you, that it
                        will contribute to better understanding between our countries. I think you
                        did not expect that we would agree with all your observations. Nevertheless,
                        I would say that some of the ideas expressed by you sound encouraging.</p>
                    <p>Yes, the Soviet Union and the United States of America must live in peace
                        with each other. They must build their relations on the basis of reason, of
                        due regard for the real situation, and of mutual respect, on the basis of
                        the establishing of the principle of peaceful coexistence between states
                        with different social systems in international affairs. This is the only
                        right and sound basis for cooperation and securing of a lasting and stable
                        peace. It is my most ardent desire that it would not remain only a dream and
                        not become a mirage, that creates nothing but false hopes.</p>
                    <p>But allow me to return to your letter of December 2. I read with satisfaction
                        the words to the effect that our personal and unofficial exchange should not
                        be used for the repetition of arguments and statements usually resorted to
                        in public debates and propaganda. Being in a complete agreement with that I
                        expected to find in your letter something new, not things which I saw many
                        times on the pages of Western newspapers and magazines which are still
                        afraid of fresh air and prefer a stuffy and poisoned atmosphere of the “cold
                        war” but, frankly, I was disappointed because while reading the letter I was
                        finding exactly what you, yourself, have cautioned against.</p>
                    <p>In your letter you, Mr. President, found it necessary to formulate flately
                        the demands which must as one may understand you, be accepted without fail
                        by the Soviet Union as a condition for negotiation on the settlement of the
                        German problem. There is hardly any need to say <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70"
                            facs="0092"/>whether it is proper or improper to put forward to one
                        another any preliminary conditions for negotiations? I think there can be no
                        two opinions here. And therefore, leaving aside this question, I would like
                        to express frankly my opinion on the substance of these conditions.</p>
                    <p>First of all, you state that the troops of the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                            >USA</gloss>, Great Britain and France “will stay in West Berlin as long
                        as the people of West Berlin want them to stay”. It could sound as an
                        ultimatum. But even most die-hard politicians in the West understand now
                        that one cannot speak such language with us. Then, there must be something
                        else in it. Frankly speaking, it is not difficult to understand that an
                        attempt to make the presence of the troops of the three powers in West
                        Berlin dependent on “the will of the population” reflects in effect a desire
                        to create a new basis for their presence there. Evidently, the US Government
                        also has inwardly come to the conclusion that to try now, 16 years after the
                        end of the war, to base its claims upon the right of occupation or the right
                        of a victor, or, as some say in the US, upon the right of the conquest, does
                        not meet either the norms of international law or the spirit of time.</p>
                    <p>The approach to this question advocated in the letter in all desire cannot be
                        accepted as valid and still less as meeting the aims of the normalization of
                        the situation in West Berlin. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, the troops
                        of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, Britain and France came to West
                        Berlin, as known, neither on the request of the population nor for its
                        protection. The purpose of their stationing there—let us be frank with each
                        other—was entirely different from that of which you write in your letter.
                        You want us to recognize now all the changes which have been unilaterally
                        made by the Western powers in West Berlin, and not only in West Berlin, and
                        to stand obediently on guard of the present rights of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, Britain and France on which we have never
                        made any agreement with you. For to call a spade a spade we are now acting
                        as traffic cops for the movement of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> troops into West Berlin. I emphasize that these are the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> troops because American, British
                        and French troops stationed in West Berlin are part and parcel of the armed
                        forces of this bloc. And as to the intentions of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> with regard to the Soviet Union and our
                        allies we are well informed of them.</p>
                    <p>You demand that contrary to common sense we continue to be traffic cops on
                        the roads to West Berlin, and your temporary occupational rights become
                        permanent there. How one can count on reaching an agreement on such a basis?
                        This is not the way things happen in life, in any case we cannot agree to
                        this.</p>
                    <p>You yourself note that it is necessary to avoid “the danger of unilateral
                        actions”, to avoid repudiation “of agreements and goals that both of us have
                        legally assumed”. But why this wish should concern the Soviet Union only? In
                        your letter unfortunately I couldn’t find any signs of recognition of
                        reciprocity.</p>
                    <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0093"/>
                    <p>It seems that it is not necessary for me to repeat what were the major points
                        in our agreements on Germany which now—not through our fault—are actually
                        not exercised.</p>
                    <p>Occupation of any given territory is a temporary measure—this is exactly how
                        it was written down in the corresponding agreements on Germany. Occupational
                        rights can naturally be valid only as long as the state of war exists.
                        Strictly speaking already now, occupation ought to have been ended since
                        state of war with Germany was terminated by unilateral statements. In any
                        case there can be no place left for it after a peace treaty has been
                        concluded.</p>
                    <p>One may think that it is a desire to have at any cost its troops in West
                        Berlin that prevents the US from taking part in a peaceful German
                        settlement. You should understand us, Mr. President—and I believe you
                        do—even if the US threatens us, tests our nerves and will, <hi rend="italic"
                            >we cannot and will never agree to the prolongation of occupational
                            order, we will struggle for our rights, for a real normalization of the
                            situation in the center of Europe</hi>. We cannot be the guards of
                        anybody’s occupational rights forever. Sometime an end must come to all
                        that. Even enslaving agreements have times provisions, let us say, 99 years.
                        Even matrimonial ties, confirmed by church and law, sometimes weaken with
                        time and break. For example, your countryman Mr. Rockefeller, having lived
                        with his wife for 30 years decided to break up the marriage. No use to go
                        into the reasons that caused this divorce but in all probability there must
                        have been some.</p>
                    <p>As for you, you do not set any time limit. You mean forever, though you do
                        not use this word. Do they in Western countries expect that socialist system
                        in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will outlive itself and then the
                        German problem will be solved in the way these countries want? But socialism
                        is a progressive vital system, it has no time limit, it will constantly
                        develop and strengthen.</p>
                    <p>One cannot count on its liquidation. And if that is the reason for the desire
                        to keep forever the regime of occupation in West Berlin—it is a strange,
                        separated from life philosophy.</p>
                    <p>It can rest—excuse my harsh judgements—only on the megalomania, on an
                        intention to act from the position of strength, though at our meeting in
                        Vienna we, it seems, came to joint conclusion that strength and threats are
                        not the argument which leads to mutual understanding.</p>
                    <p>True, you say that you denounce force as a means for achieving goals. I
                        understand you did not want to say that you are displaying generosity
                        otherwise it would sound humiliating. It is well known that in politics just
                        as in physics every action causes counteraction, and application of force or
                        repudiation of its use are connected, to speak in broad terms, not with the
                        nature of character of one or another statesman but first of all with the
                        actual state of affairs, with the balance of power which makes peaceful
                        settlement of all disputable questions a pressing necessity <pb n="72"
                            xml:id="pg_72" facs="0094"/>now and in the future. We have always deemed
                        it unreasonable to orient ourselves in politics on strength and we call on
                        other governments to do the same.</p>
                    <p>In defense of your position you refer to the rights and interests of the
                        population of West Berlin. But you, Mr. President, are certainly aware that
                        no one of the socialist countries is infringing upon these rights and
                        interests. We have always proceeded from the fact that it is an internal
                        affairs of the population of one or another state to choose its social,
                        political and economic system.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union is ready to declare solemnly and to confirm in a treaty, in
                        any international act the right of the West Berlin population to be the
                        masters of their destiny, to live without any interference from outside, the
                        right of West Berlin for unimpeded ties with the outside world. But we
                        cannot recognize and will not recognize any right for the West Berlin
                        population to call foreign troops into West Berlin since this affects the
                        security of many states. We are for safeguarding the sovereignty of West
                        Berlin but at the same time one obviously cannot neglect the sovereignty of
                        other countries and first of all the sovereignty of the country in the
                        center of which West Berlin is situated, through the territory of which all
                        its communications with the outside world run. We do not bring the solution
                        any closer when we are carried away by one side of the matter and do not
                        want to take into consideration the other, if we talk of the rights of the
                        two million citizens of West Berlin and do not want at all to give due
                        regard to the right of the citizens of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I like your suggestion to speak of “the real situation we face”. I understand
                        it so that, proceeding from the real situation existing in Germany, in
                        Europe and throughout the world, we should try to reach mutual understanding
                        on the most important questions, on which it depends today whether there be
                        peace or war on earth. But the actual situation is not what is to the liking
                        of one side—of the United States or the Soviet Union. It has as its
                        components the whole range of facts, notwithstanding how pleasant or
                        unpleasant they may be. These facts are such that the question of the
                        presence of these or other troops in West Berlin affects many countries, its
                        solution can influence not in a small degree the direction of further
                        development of Soviet-American relations, and all international
                        situations.</p>
                    <p>Here, like in other questions, one should proceed from the reality of life
                        and to act from the position of reason. In other words, one should see not
                        only his rights and somebody’s obligations but also his obligations and
                        somebody’s rights, not only defend his own interests but also take into
                        consideration the interests of the other side if one has a desire to
                        sincerely seek a mutually acceptable agreement.</p>
                    <p>In this connection one cannot but pay attention to the statement in your
                        letter that “under no circumstances,” that is even after the conclusion <pb
                            n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0095"/>of a peace treaty, the US has no
                        intention to recognize the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss> over its own territory through which all communications of
                        West Berlin with the outside world run. I will tell you frankly—a dangerous
                        position for the cause of peace! In previous messages I dwelt upon this
                        question in detail and explained the view of the Soviet Union. Here I would
                        deem it necessary only to emphasize once again the inconsistency and
                        unreality of such approach. It cannot contribute to a speediest finding of a
                        right solution of the problem we face. We would still like to believe that
                        the Western Powers will understand this and will choose another way, the way
                        of respect for international norms and sovereignty of all states,
                        irrespective of their social system.</p>
                    <p>Allow me now to express my opinion on another condition—on the possibility of
                        presence in West Berlin of Soviet troops as guarantors. You know well from
                        my messages how the Soviet Union formulates this question. We are not
                        seeking to have our troops in West Berlin. The Soviet Government believes
                        that our troops have nothing to do there, just as the troops of the Western
                        Powers. The best thing would be to have no troops in West Berlin. And if you
                        are very interested in placing foreign troops as guarantors let us agree
                        that these will be the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops.</p>
                    <p>If you do not want the Soviet Union to be a guarantor, we are not fishing for
                        any additional obligations: we have enough work of our own. Please deal on
                        all questions of interest to you with the German Democratic Republic. But we
                        believe that in this case also there should be no troops of the Western
                        Powers in West Berlin and if there still have to be some troops there these
                        should be the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> international troops.</p>
                    <p>However, as I understand, the US continues to insist that “responsibility”
                        should lie on the Soviet Union. You should agree, Mr. President, that we can
                        guarantee the interests of West Berlin only on equal conditions with other
                        states and, naturally, not to the detriment of the sovereignty of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>It is easy to say, of course: in concluding a peace treaty with the <gloss
                            target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> make provisions for the securing of such
                        and such rights for the Western Powers and everything will settle by itself.
                        Firstly, I have to say again that the Western Powers cannot expect from us
                        more than they themselves have done and are doing. Secondly, a peace treaty
                        would hardly correspond to its purpose and even to its name if instead of
                        liquidating the vestiges of the war and occupation it confirmed and
                        prolonged them forever.</p>
                    <p>If there is a desire to limit the subject of the negotiation only to the
                        confirmation of the occupation regime and the occupation rights, to a more
                        accurate definition as to on what kilometer and how many our traffic cops
                        should stand, then I am not sure whether there will be any sense and, which
                        is more important, any use in such negotiation. I would like to think that
                        in the course of our exchange a necessary degree of accord <pb n="74"
                            xml:id="pg_74" facs="0096"/>has been established between us to the
                        effect that the purpose of the negotiation is to bring the situation in a
                        certain area—important from the point of view of the preservation of
                        peace—in accordance with radically changed conditions, of course, could not
                        be precisely anticipated at its time in quadripartite agreements on Germany
                        and Berlin.</p>
                    <p>I can express my satisfaction with your words to the effect that the main
                        goal of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US Governments is
                        to ensure peace and not only care for prestige. Peace and peace treaty, I
                        think you will agree, are extremely close terms. You are inclined to believe
                        that the peace treaty proposed by us will increase tension. This will depend
                        not upon the treaty but upon the actions of Western Powers. Our proposals on
                        peaceful settlement do not contain anything which could objectively cause an
                        aggravation of [the] situation. It is our deep belief that a peace treaty
                        even with one German state is already a great progress since—though on a
                        part of the territory—it draws a line through World War II, removes its
                        vestiges which, like poisonous plants, give shoots of “cold war” every hour.
                        How a peace treaty aimed at establishing peace among states can cause
                        tension! If there are any other suggestions for solving the problem of
                        liquidation of the occupational regime on the basis of a peaceful
                        settlement, we are ready to consider them and will willingly have exchange
                        of views.</p>
                    <p>In your letter, Mr. President, you raise a question about your troops as the
                        “guarantors.” We also know that recently in the US there have been much talk
                        and writing in this connection. To listen to some people in the West, it
                        looks as if only they do really care about West Berlin and its population,
                        though it is well known that nobody threatens this city either with war or
                        an invasion.</p>
                    <p>But let us objectively analyze the situation in West Berlin. You, of course,
                        know very well that the Soviet Union stands firmly to guarantee to the
                        population of this city the right to live at their own discretion. We deeply
                        believe at the same time that West Berlin—and this is in fact the essence of
                        the matter—must have a perspective, a belief in its future. The population
                        of this city needs most of all a healthy economy that can ensure full
                        employment and high standard of living, flow of orders, inflow of capital
                        into industry, and permanently guaranteed markets. Life in West Berlin can
                        be in full swing only when production able to compete is organized, when the
                        city establishes normal relations with other states, including the <gloss
                            target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>But is this possible under the conditions of preserving the occupational
                        regime which would continue to be an apple of discord and the cause of
                        tension—is this possible? Is occupation the best way to ensure the interests
                        of the city? The more troops there will be in West Berlin, the less
                        confidence and the more doubts about the stability of the situation.
                        Stationing of foreign garrisons could testify only to the abnormality of <pb
                            n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0097"/>the situation. Is sitting on the
                        volcano helpful for calming down one’s nerves? What practical businessman
                        will invest his money into business where all is shaky and a lot is unknown?
                        Who would give him longterm orders, who would seek to live in such city
                        where real frontline atmosphere is artificially maintained?</p>
                    <p>Without the normalization of the situation, without confidence in its future
                        West Berlin is a doomed city. But it can have future, good, prosperous
                        future in case it ceases to be the center of “cold war”, a base of
                        subversive activities against socialist countries and would not be used to
                        aggravate the situation, which all impedes its life and the life of the
                        neighbouring countries. What the US is proposing now will not cure the
                        present illness of the city but, on the contrary, will make it still worse.
                        Before long everybody will realize that West Berlin cannot exist under the
                        conditions in which it is placed now, its business life will die and the
                        population, deprived of a perspective, will have to seek solutions to all
                        these problems in one way or another.</p>
                    <p>And not by chance there is even now, as it is evident from reports by Western
                        press, a flight of citizens of West Berlin and “a flight” of capital from
                        West Berlin. This process will inevitably grow if we only do not agree and
                        create a confidence for the city in its future.</p>
                    <p>If the care should really be taken for the West Berlin population living
                        calmly, without any fear about tomorrow, then it must be firmly acknowledged
                        that the best possible solution is <hi rend="italic">to sign a peace treaty
                            or treaties with two German states and to admit these states to the
                            United Nations</hi>. Thus, it will be possible to clean up completely
                        international relations from dangerous and unnecessary layers, which
                        remained as the heritage of World War II. Is it not a tempting and noble aim
                        for the sake of which we together should work?</p>
                    <p>In treaties or in a solemn proclamation or in a declaration we could express
                        our ideas about the future of Germany—about the restoration of its unity.
                        You propose to proceed in that from the right of Germans for
                        self-determination. You are right. Let us, then—in our positions—proceed
                        from the exact meaning of this word—self-determination. And it means that
                        Germans should self-determine, without an interference from outside. Germans
                        should get together with Germans, one German government—with the other
                        German government and define on what basis and how they will solve the
                        question of the restoration of German unity. Let other powers, on their
                        part, state that they will not create any obstacles for Germans. All must be
                        in the way Germans will agree.</p>
                    <p>You will probably understand in a different way many things of which I am
                        telling you now. Well, there are reasons for that. The United States of
                        America did not feel all burdens of World War II in such a degree as we did.
                        And you yourself spoke of that. Even today the United States is separated
                        from Europe by the ocean. And everything is felt not so<pb n="76"
                            xml:id="pg_76" facs="0098"/>sharp from afar as in proximity. If you
                        really think that you can live without a German peace treaty, it is up to
                        you. We are not going to impose terms of peaceful settlement with Germany
                        upon anybody of our former allies, though we will regret if the US and other
                        Western Powers refuse to sign a German peace treaty.</p>
                    <p>But let us see what can be done to lessen tension in a situation when one
                        group of states does not consider it necessary to sign a German peace treaty
                        while the other has stated its intention to achieve peaceful settlement even
                        with one of the existing German states.</p>
                    <p>I have already written to you that the Soviet Government considers it
                        possible to agree, before the conclusion of a peace treaty with the <gloss
                            target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, on basic questions which are of interest
                        to both sides. Thus, it will be possible to avoid an unnecessary aggravation
                        of relations first of all between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        and the US and to settle those questions to which each of our governments
                        attaches special importance. <hi rend="italic">It is possible to agree
                            beforehand on a status of a free city of West Berlin as I spoke of that
                            with Mr. Spaak and to make the agreement formal by a special protocol
                            which would be annexed to a peace treaty with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Other important questions could be
                            solved alongside in due order</hi>. If it is accomplished an entirely
                        different situation will come into existence in Europe and especially in
                        West Berlin, and its citizens will undoubtedly sigh with relief. To say
                        nothing of the fact that in this case favorable opportunities for the
                        development of economy and of public and political life will be created in
                        West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>This is the most wise solution which is expected from the Great Powers by the
                        peoples of the world. It will ensure better conditions for the peaceful life
                        of the peoples of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US which
                        they—and I fully support your words—equally need.</p>
                    <p>I would further like, in the interests of clarity to emphasize once again
                        that the conclusion of a peace treaty is not a theoretical goal but a
                        practical one for us. From the point of view of our national interests it is
                        one of the most important questions and we attach paramount importance to
                        its solution.</p>
                    <p>You wrote in your recent letter—and this idea was somehow reflected in your
                        interview with <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">A.I. Adzhubei</persName>—about
                        the right of the Soviet Union for due ensurance of its national security.
                        This is a fair approach.</p>
                    <p>You can further ask: what is of particular importance for us in the German
                        question regarding the ensurance of the national security of the Soviet
                        Union? I shall answer in all frankness: our main goal is to exclude a
                        possibility for an outbreak of war in Germany or because of Germany. You
                        maintain that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> does not constitute a
                        threat to peace or security of the Soviet Union or other socialist
                        countries. We cannot agree with that because we do not have the right to
                        ignore the hard lessons of the past. To you, Mr. President, our warnings of
                        the revival of German militarism <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0099"/>and
                        revanchism look like propaganda. To the peoples of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Poland, Czechoslovakia and other
                        European countries German militarism continues to be a real threat, and they
                        must always have this in mind if they do not want the events to take them by
                        surprise again.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, is it any use for us to argue whether West Germany is a
                        potential source of a military threat? If one wishes to do so this
                        discussion can be endlessly prolonged for there are no such scales that can
                        precisely weigh the arguments of each side. Wouldn’t it be better for us to
                        turn to an objective criteria—historic experience. It binds the statesmen
                        not to dismiss the worst possibility, it demands not to let the events come
                        out of control, and not to make our future and our very existence dependent
                        on the outcome of struggle in Germany between the forces of good and evil.
                        We want to be masters of our destinies. You must agree that after what
                        happened 20 years ago, we have the right to be insured against any historic
                        reverses of fortune.</p>
                    <p>You think that at present the US have the situation in the <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> under control. Let it be so. And what the
                        situation will be in 5-10 years? Senator Humphrey, for example, believes
                        that soon West Germans may demand that American, British and French troops
                        go because they consider themselves strong enough? And in every probability
                        the Western Powers will have to go. The US would not go to war with
                        Bundeswehr, would it? And what else? Can one be certain that a new lunatic
                        will not appear in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> who ignoring real
                        dislocation of forces would want to put into practice what
                        militarists-revanchists are shouting from every roof in West Germany? Then
                        it would probably be too late to think of the creation of security system
                        and the prevention of a threat on the part of German militarism and it might
                        happen we will have to pay for that with millions and millions of lives?</p>
                    <p>The farther we depart in time and policy from the Allied agreements on
                        Germany, the more difficult it will be to find joint effective guarantees
                        against the threat of German militarism to peace and stability which as it
                        seems have to be our joint aim. If it is difficult now to agree on a German
                        peace treaty because of the differences between the former allies, later on
                        it may turn out to be even more difficult.</p>
                    <p>I am frankly sharing some thoughts with you and, please, don’t understand me
                        that another attempt is made [to] agitate you for a peace treaty. I believe
                        that deep in your heart you will agree with me that the Soviet Union after
                        all it has suffered cannot be indifferent to what is happening in West
                        Germany. Behind every demand of ours to secure lasting peace in Europe and
                        prevent new German aggression—and this is exactly the reason we want to
                        liquidate the vestiges of World War II and to conclude a German peace
                        treaty—are millions of lives of perished Soviet people. <hi rend="italic">We
                            will do everything to have a peace treaty concluded and we cannot act
                            otherwise</hi>. Such is our duty before mankind and our right.</p>
                    <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0100"/>
                    <p>With all the wish to have good relations with you personally, to have good
                        relations with your government and the United States of America we must
                        conclude a German peace treaty and we will conclude it even if you do not
                        agree with this. Our most cherished goal is to solve all the problems
                        inherited from World War II in cooperation with the US, in agreement with
                        you. We say this honestly and openly. But I do not want to conceal it either
                        that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will sign a peace treaty with
                        the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> with all naturally ensuing
                        consequences without the US if there is no other way out.</p>
                    <p>Of course, in this case too we would try to avoid unnecessary aggravations. I
                        hope that such aggravations will not happen if leading Western Powers
                        defining their position take into consideration multi-sided experience of
                        peaceful settlement with various countries during the post-war period,
                        including those in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>Of course, we are far from understanding the positive moments that have
                        already begun to show in the course of the exchange of views between the
                        governments of the Soviet Union and the US. But one should not close his
                        eyes to the fact that on main principal questions narrowing the differences
                        in our positions proceeds exceedingly slowly and, may be, sometime it does
                        not proceed at all.</p>
                    <p>I would not like you to understand my observations as an expression of desire
                        to argue one or another thesis of your letter only because it comes from the
                        other side. I simply thought that I had the right to state in reply to your
                        frank statements my viewpoint without unnecessary diplomacy in this
                        case.</p>
                    <p>I believe, Mr. President, that our governments will be able to cooperate to
                        the benefit of all peoples, setting as their supreme goal service to peace
                        and in determining their positions they will always have in mind that we
                        have all the possibilities to live in good harmony and find right solutions
                        of any controversial problems.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union on its part is ready for this. Any journey begins with the
                        first step. We have to make it together and we would like that it will be
                        directed to one and the same goal—the strengthening of peace.</p>

                            <p>In these few last hours of the expiring 1961 we are sending to the
                                people of the United States the sincerest wishes for peace and
                                happiness in the new year and likewise our best wishes of personal
                                happiness to you and to your entire family. Right now on the
                                doorstep of the new year the nations live with new hope that the
                                coming year will be such a threshold in the development of events
                                when there will be undertaken efficient steps in the cause of
                                liquidation of centers of military danger. There is no doubt that on
                                the state of affairs in Soviet-American relations depends very much
                                whether humanity will go towards peace or war. At the meeting in
                                Vienna the President of the United States and Chairman of Ministers
                                of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> agreed that history
                                imposed a great responsibility on our peoples for the destinies of
                                the world. The Soviet people regard the future optimistically. They
                                express hope that in the coming new year our countries will be able
                                to find ways towards closer cooperation, will be able to find a
                                basis for concerted actions and efforts for the good of all
                                humanity. On the part of the Soviet Union, as before, there will be
                                no lack of resolution to do everything in its power in order to
                                ensure durable and lasting peace on our planet.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName>, the Chairman of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Council of Ministers, received a
                        communication from <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert F.
                            Kennedy</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d30fn1">Not further

                            Kennedy</persName> is concerned by a discouraging beginning of contacts
                        on the German problem and on other problems which should be solved in the
                        interests of the improvement of the international situation, the
                        strengthening of peace and the development of normal relations between our
                        countries.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName> fully shares the
                        President’s concern. He was discouraged even in a greater extent than the
                        President when the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Foreign Minister
                        had reported on the results of his first talks with the US Ambassador in
                        Moscow.</p>
                    <p>The position of the American Government on a number of issues, as set forth
                        by the US Ambassador, actually repeats what had been said many times by
                        former President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>,
                        Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> and by other
                        Western statesmen. It proceeds from completely wrong basis and therefore is
                        absolutely unacceptable. In fact the Soviet Union is urged to immortalize by
                        its signature that temporary, by its nature, situation which exists now,
                        that is contribute to the preservation of the occupation regime in West
                        Berlin.</p>
                    <p>But this is unthinkable. It would be not a step forward, but a step backward.
                        It is understandable that the Soviet Union cannot agree to this. So far as
                        one can judge by the statements of the US Ambassador in Moscow in his talks
                        with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Foreign Minister the United
                        States would like nothing less than to preserve the unhealthy and rather
                        dangerous situation in West Berlin which has been and remains a source of
                        tension in Europe, causes friction among dozens of states, including the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                            >USA</gloss>. The Soviet Union is pursuing quite different aims. It
                        wants to remove the hotbed of international tension and create conditions
                        for the development of good friendly relations among nations.</p>
                    <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0104"/>
                    <p>What the United States Government is proposing now would in effect not only
                        throw us all back to the days of Vienna but would have created even worse
                        prospectives. In this respect <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S.
                            Khrushchev</persName> agrees with the President. That is why the
                        Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Council of Ministers
                        is also discouraged. Yes, discouraged and distressed.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName> does not consider it
                        necessary to explain again the aims and position of the Soviet Government
                        since they were stated fully enough at the meeting with the President of the
                        United States in Vienna and also in his private messages to Mr.<persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF2">John F. Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>On the part of the head of the Soviet Government everything possible has been
                        done to convince the President of the United States that drawing a final
                        line through World War II and solving on this basis the question of changing
                        the status of West Berlin by declaring it a free demilitarized city
                        corresponds equally to the interests of all powers, to the interests of
                        peace. The Soviet Government is not seeking any other aim. It is only
                        deplorable that the US Government and the President are still searching for
                        some hidden motives in the Soviet Union’s position on this question. But
                        those motives simply do not exist and therefore there is no need to search
                        for them.</p>
                    <p>Yet, what should be done now is, of course, to seek an agreement but not to
                        push the events towards a collapse of the renewed exchange of opinions
                        between the Governments of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the
                            <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and towards new complications?</p>
                    <p>Now that the parties have already familiarized themselves with each
                        others’positions it would be useful to work out jointly the bases on which a
                        future agreement on West Berlin as well as on other questions which it is
                        necessary to solve with the conclusion of a German peace treaty should be
                        built. Proceeding from that the Soviet Government has worked out a draft of
                        the main provisions of the status of a free demilitarized city of West
                        Berlin and a draft of the protocol on guarantees which is an enclosure to
                        this status.</p>
                    <p>These documents were given to the US Government by <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA1">A.A. Gromyko</persName>, <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> Foreign Minister through Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> on January 12. The US Ambassador
                        was also given a statement in which the Soviet Government’s position on the
                        question of concluding a German peace treaty and normalizing on its basis
                        the situation in West Berlin is explained and where it is emphasized that
                        simultaneously such questions should be solved as appropriate legalization
                        and confirmation of the existing German borders, due respect for the
                        sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, non-arming of the
                        two German states with nuclear weapons and barring them from producing those
                        weapons, conclusion of a nonaggression pact between the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw treaty
                        member-countries.</p>
                    <p>Having familiarized himself with those documents the President will see that
                        neither the Soviet Union nor the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> are
                        encroaching upon <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0105"/>West Berlin and
                        demand more than the establishment for that city of an international legal
                        status corresponding to the conditions of the peace time. The Soviet
                        proposals—and it is not difficult to realize—guarantee for the population of
                        West Berlin the right to live under the social system they choose and to
                        have free access to the outer world.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName> would like very much
                        the President to consider with understanding the concrete proposals which
                        are in the drafts of the main provisions of the status of a free
                        demilitarized city of West Berlin and the protocol on the guarantees. Those
                        proposals do not make harm to anyone, do not discriminate against
                        anybody.</p>
                    <p>The policy which the Western powers continue to stick to might somehow have
                        been understood in the times when it was originated. That is a policy of
                        diktat, a policy “from the position of strength”. The late Dulles did not
                        make bones about it. But one wants to conduct this policy even now ignoring
                        the enormous changes that have taken place in the world.</p>
                    <p>The President of the United States has himself said and everybody knows it
                        that now the balance of power is equal. How, then, is it possible proceeding
                        from the equal initial conditions to attempt to conduct a policy of
                        encroachment on the interests of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        and its allies—socialist countries? But what the US Government is proposing
                        is aimed precisely against our interests.</p>
                    <p>It is known that the policy “from the position of strength” with respect to
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has proved bankrupt. The
                        establishment of the military bases around the Soviet Union, the
                        discontinuance of trade with it—all that was aimed at the isolation of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and other socialist countries, at
                        undermining their economy. Such policy has suffered a defeat.</p>
                    <p>And this is clear to every sober-minded man if he does not deliberately close
                        his eyes to it. It is bound to go bankrupt in the future as well if one
                        resorts to it.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> economy is striding forward and
                        prospering. Science and technology are rapidly developing. The Soviet Union
                        has scored great successes in the exploration of outer space. The entire
                        world including the President of the United States recognizes the
                        achievements of our country.</p>
                    <p>Then how under these conditions one can continue to pursue the “policy from
                        the position of strength”? It is hard to reconcile one with the other.
                        Therefore if the Soviet Union had not complied with and rebuffed this policy
                        in the past, the more so will it not consent to a humiliating agreement now.
                        The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will struggle with all available
                        means against any attempt to impose upon it the conditions that do not
                        correspond to the interests of consolidating peace and it will never sign
                        such agreements. If on its part the United States does not display an
                        understanding <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0106"/>of this, some time will
                        pass and the world will witness that this policy is suffering the same and
                        even greater defeat as before. If in the past Dulles threatened the Soviet
                        Union relying on the atomic weapons monopoly, now there is no trace of such
                        monopoly. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US are equal.
                        Therefore it would be senseless to threaten one or the other side with war.
                        The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is threatening nobody, it does not
                        want war, and all its efforts are aimed at excluding war. It is senseless to
                        threaten war on the Soviet people which is seeking only the normalization of
                        international situation and liquidation of the vestiges of the war. The one
                        who tries to frighten the Soviet people and threaten them will get in
                        response the same that he is threatening with and not in a lesser
                        degree.</p>
                    <p>Therefore the best thing now, if to proceed from common sense and sober
                        consideration of all facts, is to spare no effort to normalize relations,
                        and first of all among major powers, and not to preserve the hotbeds of
                        tension.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName> hopes that the
                        President of the United States will display a correct understanding of the
                            situation.<persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName> is
                        under the impression that the President has difficulties and the Chairman of
                        the Council of Ministers understands that. But every leader has his
                        difficulties. Therefore it is necessary to undertake joint efforts to
                        overcome those difficulties and reach such agreements which would be
                        beneficial to peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States as well as
                        all other peoples that long for peace and tranquil life.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>We are taking the unusual step of addressing this message to you in order to
                        express our own views, as well as to solicit yours, on what we can jointly
                        do to increase the prospects of success at the new disarmament negotiations
                        which will begin in Geneva in March.</p>
                    <p>We are convinced that a supreme effort must be made and the three of us must
                        accept a common measure of personal obligation to seek every avenue to
                        restrain and reverse the mounting arms race. Unless some means can be found
                        to make at least a start in controlling the quickening arms competition,
                        events may take their own course and erupt in a disaster which will afflict
                        all peoples, those of the Soviet Union as well as of the United Kingdom and
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>Disarmament negotiations in the past have been sporadic and frequently
                        interrupted. Indeed, there has been no sustained effort to come to grips
                        with this problem at the conference table since the three months of meetings
                        ending in June of 1960, over a year and a half ago. Before that, no real
                        negotiations on the problem of general disarmament had taken place since
                        negotiations came to an end in September 1957.</p>
                    <p>It should be clear to all of us that we can no longer afford to take a
                        passive view of these negotiations. They must not be allowed to drift into
                        failure. Accordingly, we propose that we three accept a personal
                        responsibility for directing the part to be played by our representatives in
                        the forthcoming talks, and that we agree beforehand that our representatives
                        will remain at the conference table until concrete results have been
                        achieved, however long this may take.</p>
                    <p>We propose that our negotiators seek progress on three levels. First, they
                        should be instructed to work out a program of general and complete
                        disarmament which could serve as the basis for the negotiations of an
                        implementing treaty or treaties. Our negotiators could thus build upon <pb
                            n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0108"/>the common ground which was found in
                        the bilateral talks between the United States and the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which took place this summer, and which
                        were reflected in the Statement of Agreed Principles of September 20, 1961.
                        Secondly, our negotiators should attempt to ascertain the widest measure of
                        disarmament which would be implemented at the earliest possible time whilst
                        still continuing their maximum efforts to achieve agreement on those other
                        aspects which present more difficulty. Thirdly, our negotiators should try
                        to isolate and identify initial measures of disarmament which could, if put
                        into effect without delay, materially improve international security and the
                        prospects for further disarmament progress. We do not believe that these
                        triple objectives need conflict with one another and an equal measure of
                        urgency should be attached to each.</p>
                    <p>As a symbol of the importance which we jointly attach to these negotiations,
                        we propose that we be represented at the outset of the disarmament
                        conference by the Foreign Ministers of our three countries, who would
                        declare their readiness to return to participate personally in the
                        negotiations as the progress made by our permanent representatives warrants.
                        We assume, in this case, the Foreign Ministers of other states as well will
                        wish to attend. The status and progress of the conference should, in
                        addition, be the subject of more frequent communications among the three of
                        us. In order to give impetus to the opening of the disarmament negotiations,
                        we could consider having the Foreign Ministers of our three countries
                        convene at Geneva in advance of the opening of the conference to concert our
                        plans.</p>
                    <p>At this time in our history, disarmament is the most urgent and the most
                        complex issue we face. The threatening nature of modern armaments is so
                        appalling that we cannot regard this problem as a routine one or as an issue
                        which may be useful primarily for the scoring of propaganda victories. The
                        failure in the nuclear test conference, which looked so hopeful and to the
                        success of which we attached such a high priority in the Spring of 1961,
                        constitutes a discouraging background for our new efforts. However, we must
                        be resolved to overcome this recent setback, with its immediate
                        consequences, and forego fruitless attempts to apportion blame. Our renewed
                        effort must be to seek and find ways in which the competition between us,
                        which will surely persist for the foreseeable future, can be pursued on a
                        less dangerous level. We must view the forthcoming disarmament meetings as
                        an opportunity and a challenge which time and history may not once again
                        allow us.</p>
                    <p>We would welcome an early expression of your views.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I am addressing you on a
                        question which, as is evident from your message of February 7 last, <note
                            n="1" xml:id="d32fn1">See <ref target="#d31">Document 31</ref>.</note>
                        occupies your thoughts as well.</p>
                    <p>I could not but be gratified that you also are giving some thought to the
                        role which the recently created 18-Nation Committee, which is beginning its
                        work on March 14, 1962 in Geneva and of which our countries are members,
                        will play in the solution of the disarmament problem. This is required if
                        only because the Governments of the countries represented in that Committee
                        have been entrusted, by decision of the sixteenth session of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly, with a matter of such vital
                        importance to the peoples as general and complete disarmament.</p>
                    <p>There is no need to prove that the further development of the international
                        situation will depend, to a large degree, on how the work in that Committee
                        will progress. Will it be able to rise to a level from which the distant and
                        difficult will appear near and real, will it cope with the great task placed
                        on it—to work out an agreement on general and complete disarmament? Or will
                        the new disarmament body begin, from its very first steps, to stumble over
                        the same difficulties over which its predecessors suffered a fiasco?</p>
                    <p>These are the questions the answers to which are now being sought by everyone
                        who is not indifferent to the future of mankind. And these questions animate
                        the peoples all the more deeply and strongly because the arms race is ever
                        growing, devouring the labors and the achievements of hundreds of millions
                        of peoples, while the danger of a new war is increasing, acquiring substance
                        in the mass of armaments.</p>
                    <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0110"/>
                    <p>It seems to me that all this has to be borne in mind in order correctly to
                        evaluate the significance which the disarmament negotiations to be resumed
                        in Geneva are acquiring under present conditions.</p>
                    <p>You will, apparently, agree with me, that certain preparatory work for these
                        negotiations has been done. For the first time in the entire history of
                        negotiations a disarmament body has a rather clear mandate—the basic
                        principles of general and complete disarmament approved by the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly. Hopes are raised also by
                        the fact that now the composition of the disarmament body includes
                        representatives of all of the three main groups of states existing in the
                        world: the socialist, those belonging to Western military blocs, and the
                        non-committed. These are undoubtedly positive factors.</p>
                    <p>At the same time all of us cannot but be aware of the fact that there still
                        remain to be made truly Herculean efforts in order to have the disarmament
                        negotiations bear the awaited fruits. It is sufficient to compare the Soviet
                        program for general and complete disarmament with other proposals advanced
                        at the sixteenth session of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General
                        Assembly, which are being put forward as a counter to our program, to see
                        clearly what mountains have yet to be moved from the path toward
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government deems it necessary to see to it in advance that the
                        work of the 18-Nation Committee does not become caught in the beaten track
                        and that it not be reduced in the final analysis to debates between
                        bureaucrats. All too often the various committees, subcommittees, and
                        commissions on disarmament, a great number of which have been created in the
                        past, have ceased their inglorious existence for us not to draw the
                        necessary lessons from this.</p>
                    <p>In our opinion, the most important thing now is to have the 18-Nation
                        Committee make a powerful and correct start in its work and obtain a good
                        impetus which would permit it to work productively, with a high degree of
                        efficiency.</p>
                    <p>Who is capable of bringing about such a beginning? Who can most quickly step
                        over the routine conceptions and disagreements which, like a snowball,
                        accumulate on disarmament negotiations as soon as these have begun? I should
                        think that this must first of all lie on the shoulders of those who are
                        invested with the greatest trust of the peoples and who have the full
                        breadth of authority.</p>
                    <p>Guided by these considerations, the Soviet Government proposes that the work
                        of the 18-Nation Committee be opened by the Heads of Government (State) of
                        the countries represented in that Committee. For this purpose the Heads of
                        Government would arrive in Geneva by March 14 and would themselves perform
                        the most responsible and complex part of the work which awaits the 18-Nation
                        Committee at the initial stage. Perhaps this idea will appear somewhat
                        unusual, but, you will <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0111"/>agree, it is
                        fully justified by the greatness of the goal and by the circumstances in
                        which the Disarmament Committee is beginning its activity.</p>
                    <p>Today, direct contacts among State leaders have firmly entered the practice
                        of international relations: meetings, conferences, exchanges of messages,
                        and personal participation in the work of the most represent-ative
                        international bodies. And this is understandable. The more quickly distances
                        between States are overcome and the more terrible weapons of annihilation
                        become, the more the responsibility of State leaders increases and the more
                        perspicacity and wisdom is required for resolving both important
                        international problems and others, which may, at first glance, even appear
                        to be secondary, inasmuch as they more often than not go down with their
                        roots to the questions of war and peace. This is doubly true in respect to
                        disarmament, which affects the most sensitive interests of States, their
                        security interests, and requires for its solution particular circumspection,
                        flexibility and bold exploration.</p>
                    <p>I shall not conceal the fact that I received the joint message sent by you
                        and the United Kingdom Prime Minister at the very moment when I was working
                        on this message to the Heads of Government of the States represented in the
                        18-Nation Disarmament Committee. It is a cause of satisfaction that our
                        views go generally in the same direction. I fully share the thought you
                        expressed about the personal responsibility of Heads of Government for the
                        direction of disarmament negotiations and your suggestion that the state of
                        affairs in the 18-Nation Committee be the subject of a broader exchange of
                        views between us. However, why must we take only a half step and limit
                        ourselves to being represented in the opening work of the Disarmament
                        Committee by Ministers of Foreign Affairs? If one is to be consistent, then,
                        proceeding from the considerations expressed by you, one will perforce
                        arrive at the very proposal which is being advanced by the Soviet
                        Government, namely, to begin the work of the Disarmament Committee at the
                        highest level. The work of the 18-Nation Committee can be begun at the
                        highest level even if not all the Heads of the Governments (States) members
                        of the Committee wish or can take part; that need not be an obstacle to our
                        participation in its work. It goes without saying that the Ministers of
                        Foreign Affairs of our countries should also take part in the work of the
                        18-Nation Committee both with the Heads of Government and during the
                        subsequent period of the work of the Committee.</p>
                    <p>Thus very many factors speak in favor of our proposal concerning
                        participation of the Heads of Government in the work of the 18-Nation
                        Committee. Of course, there may be people who will understand our proposal
                        in the sense that the Soviet Union is allegedly again placing a Summit
                        meeting on the agenda and who will begin deliberating whether or not the
                        conditions for that meeting now exist. I should like to clarify right away
                        that in this case it is not a matter of a Summit meeting, as it is <pb
                            n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0112"/>usually understood, but rather of the
                        Heads of State participating in the 18-Nation Committee created by the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; nor is it a matter of considering a
                        broad spectrum of international problems but a question of negotiating one
                        specific problem—that of disarmament. And only one who is not at all
                        interested in its solution can assert that conditions are not yet ripe for
                        the consideration of the disarmament problem.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, one cannot reckon that the Heads of State will be able immediately
                        to accomplish in Geneva such work that all that will remain will be to sign
                        a treaty on complete and general disarmament. But if as a result of their
                        efforts a proper direction to further negotiation is given and if the
                        contents of a treaty on general and complete disarmament are outlined, even
                        that would be an enormous change for the better long awaited by the peoples.
                        I should think that it is worthwhile, very much worthwhile, to undertake
                        such an attempt which, in the event of its success, something the Soviet
                        Government genuinely hopes for, promises to bring about a breakthrough in
                        international relations and bring mankind nearer to the realization of its
                        age-old dream of peace.</p>
                    <p>It is no secret to anyone that frequently negotiations about increased
                        military preparations are being conducted at the Heads of State level. But
                        since this is so, then on what grounds can one object to the holding of the
                        initial meetings of the 18-Nation Committee at the highest level in order to
                        make real efforts for the sake of such a noble goal as disarmament! History
                        would not forgive us if we were to let go by the opportunity of considering
                        the disarmament problem in such an authoritative forum as a meeting of the
                        Heads of Government of 18 States especially conducted for that purpose.</p>
                    <p>I should like to hope that you will correctly understand the motives which
                        have prompted the Soviet Government to propose that the work of the
                        18-Nation Committee be begun at the level of Heads of Government (State),
                        and that you will have a positive attitude toward this proposal.</p>
                    <p>I have addressed myself with messages of a similar content to all the Heads
                        of Government (State) of the countries represented in the 18-Nation
                        Disarmament Committee.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Chairman</hi>: In reading your letter of
                        February 10, 1962 <note n="1" xml:id="d33fn1"><ref target="#d32">Document
                                32</ref>.</note> I was gratified to see that you have been thinking
                        along the same lines as Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
                            >Macmillan</persName> and myself as to the importance of the new
                        disarmament negotiations which will begin in Geneva in March. I was
                        gratified also to see that you agree that the heads of government should
                        assume personal responsibility for the success of these negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The question which must be decided, of course, is how that personal
                        responsibility can be most usefully discharged. I do not believe that the
                        attendance by the heads of government at the outset of an 18-Nation
                        conference is the best way to move forward. I believe that a procedure along
                        the lines of that outlined in the letter which Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> and I addressed to you on
                        February 7 <note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2">See <ref target="#d31">Document
                                31</ref>.</note> is the one best designed to give impetus to the
                        work of the conference.</p>
                    <p>I agree with the statement which you have made in your letter that there
                        exists a better basis than has previously existed for successful work by the
                        conference. The Agreed Statement of Principles for Disarmament Negotiations
                        which was signed by representatives of our countries on September 20, 1961
                        and which was noted with approval by the 16th General Assembly of the United
                        Nations represents a foundation upon which a successful negotiation may be
                        built.</p>
                    <p>As you have recognized, there still exist substantial differences between our
                        two positions. Just one example is the Soviet unwillingness so far to accord
                        the control organization the authority to verify during the disarmament
                        process that agreed levels of forces and armament are not exceeded.</p>
                    <p>The task of the conference will be to attempt to explore this and other
                        differences which may exist and to search for means of overcoming them by
                        specific disarmament plans and measures. This does not mean that the
                        conference should stay with routine procedures or arguments or that the
                        heads of government should not be interested in the negotiations from the
                        very outset. It does mean that much clarifying work will have to be <pb
                            n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0114"/>done in the early stages of
                        negotiation before it is possible for Heads of Government to review the
                        situation. This may be necessary in any case before June 1 when a report is
                        to be filed on the progress achieved.</p>
                    <p>I do not mean to question the utility or perhaps even the necessity of a
                        meeting of Heads of Government. Indeed, I am quite ready to participate
                        personally at the Heads of Government level at any stage of the conference
                        when it appears that such participation could positively affect the chances
                        of success. The question is rather one of timing. I feel that until there
                        have been systematic negotiations—until the main problems have been
                        clarified and progress has been made, intervention by Heads of Government
                        would involve merely a general exchange of governmental positions which
                        might set back, rather than advance, the prospects for disarmament. It is
                        for these reasons that I think that meetings at the highly responsible level
                        of our Foreign Ministers as well as the Foreign Ministers of those other
                        participating states who wish to do so would be the best instrument for the
                        opening stages.</p>
                    <p>A special obligation for the success of the conference devolves upon our two
                        Governments and that of the United Kingdom as nuclear powers. I therefore
                        hope that the suggestion made in the letter of Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> and myself to you, that the
                        Foreign Ministers of the three countries meet in advance of the conference
                        in order to concert plans for its work, will be acceptable to the Soviet
                        Government.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Chairman</hi>: In order to permit the further
                        development of the conversations between Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, I have not answered directly your
                        letter of December 13, 1961, <note n="1" xml:id="d34fn1"><ref target="#d27"
                                >Document 27</ref>.</note> nor the message which you sent me through
                        my brother.<note n="2" xml:id="d34fn2"><ref target="#d30">Document
                            30</ref>.</note> I had <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0115"/>hoped that
                        these conversations might lead to some more positive note on Germany and
                        Berlin that could be further developed in this more direct and confidential
                        channel.</p>
                    <p>It appears, however, that neither that series of conversations nor this
                        channel is bringing our positions any closer together. The talks between
                            Messrs.<persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> are tending to become more and more
                        formal, with each side exchanging diplomatic messages restating their
                        positions. Your communications to me still refer to the policy of “positions
                        of strength” as though the West were in some way threatening the Soviet
                        Union—and inasmuch as I am quite aware of the strength and determination of
                        the Soviet people, and you, I am sure, are equally aware of our qualities, I
                        would hope that we could dispense with this kind of exchange which is
                        reminiscent of an earlier period in our relations.</p>
                    <p>It would seem today that neither of us knows very much more about the
                        prospects for accommodation than we knew many months ago—i.e., you know that
                        the West will not withdraw its troops from West Berlin or accept the
                        stationing of Soviet troops there, and we know that you will not accept any
                        arrangements for the city of Berlin as whole.</p>
                    <p>While these changes are thus not on the list of possible agreement, I should
                        state again in this regard that it is not the Western powers who are seeking
                        a change in the status of Berlin. While we do not consider the situation in
                        Germany today to be satisfactory, we recognize that there is very little
                        likelihood of effecting any basic change in the direction of Western aims,
                        inasmuch as we exclude the employment of force to this end, and certainly
                        prefer not to initiate any unilateral action that might provoke increased
                        tension or fear. On the other hand, the Soviet Union also recognizes, I am
                        sure, that it cannot unilaterally bring about a change in the existing
                        situation which would result in damage to the rights, obligations and
                        interests of the Allied powers and the people of West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Both of us, therefore, however differently we may view the issues, are
                        confronted with the same basic question: how to deal with the present state
                        of affairs in a manner which will (1) avoid any shift favorable to one side
                        and detrimental to the other, and (2) ensure a greater degree of stability
                        and tranquillity in the entire German situation. I believe that if we take
                        these two principles as a starting point, we might be able to see some light
                        at the end of the tunnel.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless it is increasingly clear that we hold wholly different views on
                        what kind of solution would be best in the long run; and equally clear,
                        therefore, that we must patiently expect the negotiations, exchanges and
                        conferences required before agreement is reached to extend over a
                        considerable period of time. Look how many months and years, for example,
                        were spent in the talks on nuclear tests which, though as yet unproductive,
                        covered an area where a potential agreement was no more urgently in the
                        common interest of both sides. Fortunately, both you and <pb n="94"
                            xml:id="pg_94" facs="0116"/>I—or so I strongly believe—are able to take
                        the long view, and to recognize our joint responsibility for patiently
                        continuing the search for a joint solution—instead of taking some
                        precipitate unilateral action that might endanger the peace that prevails in
                        Germany now. While our negotiations should make whatever progress is
                        possible and avoid undue delays, we should bear in mind, as I said to
                            Mr.<persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>, <note n="3"

                        or other areas.</p>
                    <p>For this reason I would hope that we would both take special pains to adhere
                        to that principle, included in the disarmament principles on which we agreed
                        at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> last fall, which enjoined both
                        sides to refrain, as the disarmament talks began, from any actions in the
                        international field which might tend to increase tensions. As Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> has made clear, we view
                        the recent acts of harassment in the Berlin air corridors with very grave
                        concern; and it does not seem likely that serious progress could be made on
                        these or other talks as long as one side is increasing tensions in this
                        fashion.</p>
                    <p>I had understood, from my conversations with Mr.<persName corresp="#p_AAI1"
                            >Adzhubei</persName> as well as my earlier talks with Mr.<persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, that both sides recognized the
                        desirability of doing nothing which would increase the difficulties of
                        peaceful negotiation. As you have stated in your letter, in politics just as
                        in physics every action causes counteraction, so that every danger or
                        pressure you place upon us is in effect adding to the dangers or pressures
                        which the increased prospects of conflict signify for you. Moreover, the
                        prospects for alleviating the other concerns which you have expressed and
                        which I fully understand—a future excess of German nationalism and the
                        proliferation of nuclear weapons, for example—are certain to be increased
                        rather than diminished by each new increase in tension and pressure. I am
                        certain that these concerns could be satisfactorily met if an understanding
                        could be achieved—but further pressures on the West in Berlin only increase
                        the pressure within France and the Federal Republic of Germany to build a
                        greater military force, to secure an independent nuclear capacity and to
                        adopt a more rigid attitude on any accommodation.</p>
                    <p>Another way to improve the prospects of an advance in these discussions would
                        be to instruct our two representatives in Moscow to concentrate on concrete
                        matters and avoid further generalized and repetitive statements of position.
                        For example, Mr.<persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>, during our
                        very interesting conversation of last January 30 here at the White
                            House,<note n="4" xml:id="d34fn4">According to a page attached to the
                            source text, the rest of this paragraph was a redraft by Sorensen on
                            February 15.</note> suggested there might be some variation in the
                        possibilities of an <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0117"/>International
                        Commission supervising access with East German participation. If further
                        details on this possibility and other variations are forthcoming, they might
                        be further explored by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                            >Thompson</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                            >Gromyko</persName>. This is the sort of fresh and concrete subject
                        matter to which their time should be devoted.</p>
                    <p>I have written frankly of these matters in the hope that you will respond in
                        kind. I can assure you that I will continue to hold in the utmost secrecy
                        any message or proposal sent through this channel, for I have always
                        regarded it as a private and confidential means of communication, without
                        all of the pressures which public communications bring to any question of
                        this kind.</p>
                    <p>I realize that such an exchange, if successful, would represent a
                        considerable departure from normal diplomacy. But, surely we both recognize
                        that new situations require new methods of procedure. And I feel very
                        strongly that we must make every effort and explore every possibility to
                        avoid the development of a major crisis over Berlin, replete with all the
                        dangers of war. To avoid such a development is, I know, your basic desire as
                        well as mine; and I am convinced, as I believe you are, that if we can
                        either find some modus vivendi in regard to Berlin or a more solid
                        long-range agreement, this will open up the possibility of agreements on
                        many other questions, including those mentioned in your communications
                        through my brother—including the question of German frontiers, respect for
                        the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, prohibition of
                        nuclear weapons for both parts of Germany, and the conclusion of a pact of
                        non-aggression between <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw
                        powers.</p>
                    <p>I was particularly glad to read in your letter that you share our hopes for
                        peace. It was in that spirit that I was pleased to talk again with your
                        son-in-law, Mr.<persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>, and stress
                        to him the importance of avoiding any threats to the peace in this area. I
                        enjoyed meeting with him on this occasion, and I was very pleased to see
                        your lovely daughter. I hope she enjoyed her visit, and that there will be
                        an opportunity for similar visits in the years to come.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: On behalf of the people of the
                        Soviet Union and myself personally I congratulate you and the American
                        people on the occasion of the successful launching of a spaceship with a man
                        on board.</p>
                    <p>One more step has been taken toward mastering the cosmos and this time
                        Lieutenant Colonel <persName>John Glenn</persName>, a citizen of the United
                        States of America, has been added to the family of astronauts. The
                        successful launching of spaceships signalizing the conquest of new heights
                        in science and technology inspire legitimate pride for the limitless
                        potentialities of the human mind to serve the welfare of humanity. It is to
                        be hoped that the genius of man, penetrating the depth of the universe, will
                        be able to find ways to lasting peace and ensure the prosperity of all
                        peoples on our planet earth which, in the space age, though it does not seem
                        so large, is still dear to all of its inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>If our countries pooled their efforts—scientific, technical and material—to
                        master the universe, this would be very beneficial for the advance of
                        science and would be joyfully acclaimed by all peoples who would like to see
                        scientific achievements benefit man and not be used for “cold war” purposes
                        and the arms race.</p>
                    <p>Please convey cordial congratulations and best wishes to astronaut

                        successful space flight, and I welcome your statement that our countries
                        should cooperate in the exploration of space.<note n="1" xml:id="d36fn1"

                        same belief and indeed put it forward strongly in my first State of the
                        Union message.</p>
                    <p>We of course believe also in strong support of the work of the United Nations
                        in this field and we are cooperating directly with many other countries
                        individually. But obviously special opportunities and responsibilities fall
                        to our two countries.</p>
                    <p>I am instructing the appropriate officers of this Government to prepare new
                        and concrete proposals for immediate projects of common action, and I hope
                        that at a very early date our representatives may meet to discuss our ideas

                    <p>I shall not conceal that for a long time I have been hatching the thought of

                        even more.</p>
                    <p>However, after your reply to my message, the situation looks entirely

                    <p>According to your message, you believe that even if participation by the
                        Heads of Government in disarmament negotiations is possible it should be
                        postponed until such time when definite progress has been reached in
                        negotiations. But the legitimate question arises—who, then, can ensure with
                        the greatest probability of success such progress, who can create a
                        favorable situation for negotiations? Those who are vested with the full
                        breadth of authority and who have the leading role in shaping policy or, on
                        the other hand, those who are not vested with such responsibility and
                        consequently are limited in their actions by previously determined
                        instructions? It seems to me that there can be no two answers to this
                        question. It is clear that the Heads of Government have much greater
                        possibilities for this than anybody else.</p>
                    <p>The question may also be raised in the following manner: what is better, what
                        will yield greater benefits—leadership exercised by the Heads of Government
                        from a distance, or on the other hand when they themselves, having rolled up
                        their sleeves, undertake the most difficult and give a correct orientation
                        to the negotiations and ensure the progress of which you speak in your
                        message.</p>
                    <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0121"/>
                    <p>As for me, the guiding precept of my life is to be where the main work is
                        being done, where it is most important to obtain success. As I understand
                        it, the position of Head of State requires this. If we remained far from
                        Geneva, we would, whether we wanted it or not, have to consider the problems
                        arising in the course of the disarmament negotiations merely as one among
                        many other important matters with which officials in our position have to
                        deal every day.</p>
                    <p>Frankly, I am surprised at the inconsistency in certain arguments advanced in
                        your message. You agree that the Heads of Government should assume personal
                        responsibility for the success of the disarmament negotiations to be opened
                        in Geneva on March 14 of this year. But at the same time you propose that we
                        wait until the Ministers of Foreign Affairs have achieved definite progress.
                        Well, if, as was the case in the past, disarmament negotiations should fail
                        to make progress—what then, should the Heads of State wash their hands? But
                        then what will there be left of their personal responsibility for the course
                        of negotiations, the importance of which you emphasize in your message? No,
                        you can not really make these things jibe.</p>
                    <p>Nor do I find convincing your statement that before it becomes possible for
                        the Heads of State to examine the situation arising in the disarmament
                        negotiations there should be done a great deal of work in clarifying the
                        positions of the sides. I shall go even further and say that your statement
                        that something is yet to be fully clarified was extremely disappointing to
                        me. The unfortunate thing lies precisely in the fact that so far disarmament
                        has not gone beyond clarification of positions. How long can one continue to
                        engage in eliciting, studying, and clarifying each other’s positions, when
                        negotiations, meetings and contacts at various levels, endless arguments and
                        disputes, which have been going on for some fifteen years have been devoted
                        essentially to this task.</p>
                    <p>Do we not have enough documents accumulated which give a complete schedule of
                        the stages of disarmament, which set forth in all the details and minutia
                        the methods of disarmament and the measures of control over it, in short,
                        documents which quite clearly set forth the positions of the respective
                        governments? Of course to this pile of documents more than one heap of
                        papers could be added, but that would not reduce the existing armies even by
                        one division or even one soldier, or armaments by a single rocket or a
                        single bullet. The delay is caused not by the lack of clarity as to the
                        questions where we disagree but rather as to where our views are closer
                        together. For a long time now the problem has been not that of clarifying
                        positions but rather of how the differences that have emerged should be
                        overcome and how the path toward agreement should be paved. To say, then,
                        that somebody still has to engage in clarifying positions—that is simply
                        refusal to attempt to direct disarmament negotiations in a practical
                        channel.</p>
                    <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0122"/>
                    <p>If the previous negotiations have really left certain questions unanswered,
                        then this is apparently not at all because little effort has been made to
                        clarify them. As I have already indicated, disarmament intrudes in the
                        sacrosanctum of every state, in the area of ensuring their security, which,
                        in the present world situation, everybody prefers to keep far from the eyes
                        of others. A certain degree of trust and responsibility, without which it is
                        impossible even to come close to the solution of disarmament problems, can
                        therefore be reached only among those who bear the highest responsibility
                        before the peoples of their countries for their security. And nobody else
                        but the Heads of Government (State) bear such responsibility. Moreover, many
                        of them would have to assume the leadership of the armed forces of their
                        countries should times of trial occur. Nor is it necessary to prove that
                        personal contacts among Heads of State can sooner lead to a better
                        understanding of one another’s aspirations, greater trust, and as a
                        consequence—who knows—perhaps even new ideas.</p>
                    <p>If the experience of previous disarmament negotiations has been in any way
                        useful, then it is primarily because it has demonstrated how few practical
                        moves in the matter of disarmament one can expect without the most direct
                        and businesslike participation in negotiations of officials holding the
                        highest position. It is precisely because the positions of the participants
                        in negotiations have been overly clarified that the conclusion arises by
                        itself that only such officials can move the disarmament question off dead
                        center, if, of course, all parties desire this.</p>
                    <p>Therefore neither Ministers, whatever esteem they may enjoy on the part of
                        the governments and the peoples of their countries, nor other
                        representatives, whatever their rank, will achieve anything if the Heads of
                        State do not place the negotiations on a solid foundation, having
                        demonstrated the will and desire to reach agreement on disarmament
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>If you have no desire to head now the U.S. Delegation to the negotiations in
                        the 18-Nation Committee and you use in explanation of your position such an
                        artificial argument as lack of appropriate preparations, then this can only
                        indicate that the resolution to reach agreement on disarmament questions has
                        not yet become ripe in your mind. There unavoidably arises the question—is
                        it not, Mr. President, because in your own mind you have already condemned
                        the 18-Nation Committee to failure and are thinking in advance in terms of
                        this Committee’s failing to ensure the solution of the questions for which
                        it has been created that you do not wish to go to Geneva now? It appears
                        that the Western Powers are not yet ready for a disarmament agreement and
                        you therefore think that for the time being it is more convenient to keep
                        somewhat aside from the negotiations on this question. This is how all
                        thinking people will have to <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0123"/>assess
                        your unwillingness to have the Disarmament Committee meet at the highest
                        level.</p>
                    <p>To unload the work in the 18-Nation Committee on the Ministers of Foreign
                        Affairs is to demonstrate clearly—and the Ministers will, of course,
                        understand this—that the Heads of Government, the Heads of State do not wish
                        to assume the responsibility for a possible failure of negotiations and
                        prefer that all sins be charged to the Ministers.</p>
                    <p>It is easy to imagine what the situation may turn out to be in the final
                        analysis. The Ministers of Foreign Affairs, who are busy people,
                        transfer—and this happens quite frequently—the conduct of negotiations to
                        persons of a somewhat lower rank and those, in turn, to officials who are
                        another step lower on the ladder. This is how it turns out that
                        negotiations, as a matter of fact, are finally conducted among bureaucrats.
                        And then try to find out where that personal responsibility of the Heads of
                        Government for negotiations, of which you now speak, actually is.</p>
                    <p>In your message of February 14, you, Mr. President, refer to the fact that
                        there are substantial differences between our countries in the question of
                        control of disarmament. That is correct, such differences exist, but what is
                        their root? You seek the Soviet Union’s agreement to the establishment of
                        control not only over armed forces and armaments which are being reduced or
                        destroyed under the agreement but also over that portion which will remain
                        in the possession of states for the time being. It appears that the U.S. and
                        its allies would like to have the Soviet Union place under control all of
                        its armed forces and open up its entire defense system even before
                        disarmament has really begun.</p>
                    <p>I must say frankly that with such an approach to the question of control you
                        will attain nothing because to this we will not agree.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union is interested in the establishment of the strictest
                        international control over the fulfillment of a disarmament agreement. If,
                        for instance, we reach agreement on general and complete disarmament in
                        stages, then, in our opinion, the implementation of all disarmament measures
                        provided for each stage must be thoroughly verified. We want no less than
                        anybody else to have assurance that the armaments and armed forces to be
                        liquidated at a given stage are actually being liquidated or are being
                        treated in such a manner as had been agreed in advance and recorded in the
                        Treaty. This precisely is real, effective control over disarmament. On the
                        other hand, you propose not control over disarmament but something entirely
                        different.</p>
                    <p>Let us imagine that we are negotiating reduction of the armed forces of our
                        countries by several divisions. We are prepared to agree to this.</p>
                    <p>But you demand that control be established not only over the disbanding of
                        those divisions but over all of the armed forces and armaments that are at
                        the disposal of states. This is really like the saying: “A ruble for a lamb
                        with ten rubles for change”.</p>
                    <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0124"/>
                    <p>In the age of rocket and nuclear weapons—and we have entered that age—masses
                        of troops have far less significance than they had in the First and Second
                        World Wars. Today, war would immediately assume an all-embracing universal
                        character and its outcome would depend not on the actions of troops placed
                        at the line dividing the belligerent parties but rather on the application
                        of rocket and nuclear weapons, with which the deciding strike can be made
                        even before mass armies have been mobilized and introduced into combat.</p>
                    <p>Thus, under modern conditions reduction of the armed forces of states by
                        several divisions would in no way change the situation. Control over the
                        military potential of states which you wish to obtain in exchange for an
                        essentially insignificant reduction in armed forces, is another matter. The
                        establishment of such control would yield a major strategic advantage to the
                        state planning aggression.</p>
                    <p>The control proposed by the Western Powers, i.e., control actually before
                        disarmament, we regard with full justification as espionage. Such control
                        would permit an aggressive state to place its intelligence agents on the
                        territories of peace-loving states and to collect information about their
                        defense systems: and then to decide the question whether to agree to further
                        disarmament or turn the course of events toward war.</p>
                    <p>We do not wish this. The Soviet Union strives for an honest agreement which
                        would provide guarantee that neither during the process of disarmament nor
                        after its completion a threat to the security of any state will arise. This
                        is why we say—let us work out a treaty on general and complete disarmament
                        under the strictest international control and let us implement the
                        provisions of that treaty in stages so that control be commensurate with the
                        disarmament steps undertaken. Having completed one stage of disarmament
                        under control let us move to the implementation of the next stage, also
                        under control. This is a sound, realistic approach to the question of
                        control, and so far no one has been able to propose a better one.</p>
                    <p>In the initial stages of disarmament there will of course remain some armed
                        forces and armaments which will temporarily be outside the sphere of
                        international control. But will this change anything as compared with what
                        we have today? After all, even now we know exactly the amounts of armaments
                        at the disposal of the other side. Under staged disarmament we will reduce
                        the armed forces and armaments by agreed increments and therefore the
                        correlation of forces and the balance which has by now been established will
                        not be disturbed. As to the amount of armed forces and armaments on which we
                        will have no exact data after the completion of each stage, it will
                        constantly decrease until it comes down to zero.</p>
                    <p>Where then, does this involve a threat to strategic security of states? There
                        is no such threat and it cannot exist with this approach.</p>
                    <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0125"/>
                    <p>This can in no way be said about proposals of the Western Powers. In
                        insisting that control march before disarmament the Western Powers only
                        strengthen the suspicions that they are pursuing any possible objective
                        other than disarmament. The impression is created that some kind of a
                        disarmament game is being played. The peoples of the entire world demand
                        disarmament, they want to throw off their shoulders the burden of military
                        expenditures, to clear the horizon of the thunder clouds of war, while the
                        Western Powers do not feel like disarming. This is why all sorts of plans
                        appear, deliberately calculated to be rejected by the other side. All this
                        resembles trickery which is resorted to in order to bury a live cause.</p>
                    <p>Now how else can one assess such recipes for disarmament as provide for the
                        reduction in troops by one percent and for the extension of control over all
                        of the other ninety-nine percent of armed forces? How else can one
                        understand the refusal of the Western Powers to reduce the scope of their
                        military preparations at least to some extent, for example, to liquidate the
                        military bases in foreign territories and to withdraw their troops from
                        Europe to the confines of their states. The Soviet Union is prepared even
                        now to bring home its troops which are outside the country if the Western
                        Powers do the same.</p>
                    <p>Where is there to be found here real partnership, understanding of the
                        aspirations of the peoples, and the desire to remove the danger of a rocket
                        and nuclear war, which would bring unbelievable disaster and suffering to
                        all of mankind? There is not even a trace of that.</p>
                    <p>With this attitude on the part of the Governments of the Western Powers
                        toward the cause of disarmament, where behind ostensible bustle around the
                        questions of control there is being pushed somewhere into the backyard the
                        main thing—disarmament of the military establishment of states, one has
                        really to fear lest the new Committee is facing the sorry lot of its
                        predecessors. If there is no desire to agree on a realistic basis, then
                        obviously disarmament negotiations will amount to nothing whether the work
                        of the Committee started with the participation of the Heads of Government
                        or at the Foreign Minister level, or any other level.</p>
                    <p>I am not used to playing the hypocrite and hiding the truth in my pocket and
                        therefore shall say without beating around the bush: Your reply message, Mr.
                        President, as well as the message from Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> have generated in me the feeling
                        that those journalists who see some special purposes in your proposal to
                        begin the work of the 18-Nation Committee at the Foreign Minister level are
                        perhaps right. They connect this proposal directly with the statement of the
                        Governments of the United States and Great Britain about their intention to
                        resume nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>What is the reasoning of the journalists? They understand that the Soviet
                        Union will not leave that aggressive action unanswered. The unrestrained <pb
                            n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0126"/>desire on the part of the United
                        States and Great Britain to increase their nuclear arsenal and to increase
                        the destructive power of their nuclear weapons will unavoidably lead to the
                        Soviet Union’s being drawn into competition in the sphere of accumulation
                        and perfection of nuclear weapons. It is understandable that the Soviet
                        Union, which incidentally has conducted far fewer experimental nuclear
                        explosions, will not wish to lag behind and will do everything to maintain
                        its nuclear weapons at the proper level. As a result, swings will be set in
                        motion to heights never seen before, raising the nuclear armaments race to
                        ever-higher levels. Naturally, the peoples will place the responsibility for
                        this on the Governments of the United States and Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>It is in connection with this that it is being said that in advancing the
                        idea of conducting disarmament negotiations at the Ministerial level, the
                        Governments of the United States and Great Britain sought somehow to
                        paralyze the negative attitude of public opinion toward the planned
                        resumption of nuclear tests and to sweeten the bitter pill by making a
                        gesture in the direction of disarmament. This opinion became even stronger
                        when the United States and Great Britain replied in the negative to the
                        concrete, businesslike proposal of the Soviet Union to begin the work of the
                        disarmament committee at the highest level with participation by the Heads
                        of Government, a proposal that gives greater assurance of success in
                        negotiations. As much as I would like to avoid unpleasant words—but the
                        conclusion imposes itself that apparently there is some truth in such
                        commentaries by journalists.</p>
                    <p>Where then is the matter going? We live in a time when science and technology
                        are developing swiftly and new scientific and technological achievements are
                        born literally not every day but every hour. Rocket and nuclear armaments
                        are ever increasing and now both we and you already have thousands of units
                        of such weapons. They are manned by many thousands of personnel and that
                        number is ever increasing as the number of rockets increases. But the more
                        people are assigned to the manning of lethal rockets and nuclear weapons,
                        the greater the probability that the unexpected may occur. After all, there
                        have already been cases in the United States where bombers on alert missions
                        with a payload of nuclear bombs had accidents and fell to the ground causing
                        considerable unpleasant consequences.</p>
                    <p>And is it really out of the question that something similar can happen not
                        only with bombers but also with rockets equipped with thermonuclear
                        warheads? In addition to all sorts of other reasons, this or that human
                        being manning a rocket-launching site may suffer a mental breakdown and then
                        an irreparable event would occur: A nuclear explosion would occur on the
                        territory of another state. It would then be difficult to prove that this
                        was the consequence of an accident and nothing more. Moreover, would there
                        be time for any explanations or for the <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105"
                            facs="0127"/>hearing of such explanations? The accidental launching of a
                        rocket with a thermonuclear warhead could serve as a signal for a world-wide
                        military catastrophe.</p>
                    <p>Hunters have a good unwritten rule: Even if you know that your gun is not
                        loaded, never aim it in the direction of a human being, even for fun. It is
                        not for nothing that they say that once in ten years even an unloaded gun
                        goes off.</p>
                    <p>Comparatively recently there was a report in the press that the life of the
                        great American writer Hemingway had been ended by an accidental shot while a
                        shotgun was being cleaned. As great as this loss may be, still in this
                        instance only one human being lost his life as a result of careless handling
                        of a weapon. On the other hand an accident in handling rocket and nuclear
                        weapons would bring about the death of millions upon millions of people,
                        while many would be condemned to slow death as a result of radioactive
                        contamination.</p>
                    <p>All this brings to mind once again that the leading officials of states, who
                        bear the responsibility for the destinies of peoples, must realize the
                        actual state of affairs which has already been brought about by the rocket
                        and nuclear armaments race and to which this race is leading. General and
                        complete disarmament, that is, complete destruction of all armaments,
                        particularly nuclear, has become in our time a vitally necessary task, which
                        stands above everything else. In the interests of the speediest solution of
                        this task the Soviet Government has been and still is for having the
                        18-Nation Disarmament Committee begin its work at the highest level.</p>
                    <p>The search for agreement on disarmament problems requires that unnecessary
                        punctiliousness be cast aside and that the interests of the cause, the
                        interests of strengthening peace, be placed above everything else. This is
                        why I should like to hope that you, Mr. President, have not yet said your
                        last word concerning your participation in the negotiations in the 18-Nation
                        Disarmament Committee.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government sincerely seeks to reach agreement on disarmament and
                        has proposed with the best of intentions that the work of the 18-Nation
                        Committee be begun at the highest level.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government believes that the proposals for general and complete
                        disarmament under strict international control advanced by it provide a
                        basis for reaching agreement without prejudice to any individual party and
                        without advantage to any other party. Of course we are prepared to consider
                        other proposals as well if they really will ensure the solution of the
                        problem of general and complete disarmament.</p>
                    <p>If the Governments of the Western Powers desire agreement on disarmament
                        problems—and the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries do wish to
                        reach it—then one could definitely hope that negotiations with the
                        participation of the Heads of Government will <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106"
                            facs="0128"/>yield tangible results, and agreement will become possible.
                        This would be a great honor to those who would have laid, at the beginning
                        of the negotiations, the foundation for a future agreement and found ways of
                        overcoming the existing difficulties. And what a great reward it would be
                        for the Heads of Government, Heads of State, then to sign a treaty on
                        general and complete disarmament and to become participants in an historic
                        event which would remain in the memories of all mankind for ages to
                        come.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I regret that in your message of February 21, <note n="1" xml:id="d38fn1"
                                ><ref target="#d37">Document 37</ref>.</note> you seem to challenge
                        the motivations of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
                            >Macmillan</persName> and myself in making our proposal of February 7
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d38fn2">See <ref target="#d31">Document
                            31</ref>.</note> that the forthcoming Disarmament Conference open at the
                        Foreign Minister level. I believe that there can be a legitimate difference
                        of opinion on the most effective and orderly way to make progress in the
                        vitally important field of disarmament.</p>
                    <p>You have presented your own views and I do not wish to imply that they are
                        motivated by anything other than your own conviction that the way you
                        suggest is the best way to proceed. However, I must say that even though I
                        have given the most careful thought to the considerations <pb n="107"
                            xml:id="pg_107" facs="0129"/>you advance, I continue to hold to my view
                        that the personal participation in Geneva by the Heads of Government should
                        be reserved until a later stage in the negotiations when certain preliminary
                        work has been accomplished.</p>
                    <p>Indeed some of the statements you make reinforce my view in this respect.
                        Your discussion of the control problem, for example, is based, in my view,
                        on a fundamental misconception of the US position that can probably best be
                        clarified in the light of discussion of specific verification requirements
                        for specific disarmament measures. It is not true, as you allege, that the
                        United States is seeking to establish complete control over national
                        armaments from the beginning of the disarmament process. Our position is a
                        quite simple one and it is that whatever disarmament obligations are
                        undertaken must be subject to satisfactory verification. For example, if, as
                        we have both proposed, there is an agreement to reduce the level of armed
                        forces to a specified number, we must be able to ensure through proper
                        verification mechanisms that this level is not exceeded. I do not propose
                        here to discuss this subject at length. I wish merely to point out that this
                        is the type of issue on which more work should be done before it can
                        usefully be dealt with at a Heads of Government meeting.</p>
                    <p>If it were not for the existence of the Statement of Agreed Principles which
                        was worked out so laboriously between representatives of our two countries
                        last year, there might be greater force to your reasoning that Heads of
                        Government should meet at the outset to set directions for the negotiations.
                        In my view the Statement of Agreed Principles constitutes just the type of
                        framework which would be the most that could be expected at this point from
                        a meeting of the Heads of Government. Since this has already been done, I
                        believe now we need to have our representatives do further exploratory work
                        of a more detailed nature.</p>
                    <p>As I have said and as I now repeat, I think it is of the utmost importance
                        that the Heads of Government of the major nuclear powers assume a personal
                        responsibility for directing their countries’ participation in and following
                        the course of these negotiations. I can assure you that the Secretary of
                        State would present my views with complete authority. Even so, I hope
                        developments in the conference and internationally would make it useful to
                        arrange for the personal participation of the Heads of Government before
                        June 1. I do not, however, believe that this should be done at the outset
                        and I must say frankly, Mr. Chairman, that I believe this view is well
                        founded. I believe that to have such a meeting at this point would be to
                        begin with the wrong end of the problem. The Heads of Government should meet
                        to resolve explicit points of disagreement which might remain after the
                        issues have been carefully explored and the largest possible measure of
                        agreement has been worked out at the diplomatic level.</p>
                    <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0130"/>
                    <p>I continue to hope that you will agree to the proposed procedure which was
                        set forth in Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
                        >Macmillan</persName>’s and my initial letter of February 7. I believe that
                        the replies which have been made by other prospective participants to your
                        messages indicate a general support for this approach and I trust that you
                        will give a favorable response.</p>
                    <p>I cannot conclude this letter without mentioning briefly the problem of
                        nuclear testing. Since I assumed the office of President of the United
                        States, the conclusion of a nuclear test agreement has been a primary
                        objective of mine. The record of American participation in the negotiations
                        on this subject has demonstrated fully the creative effort we made to
                        achieve agreement. It must be understood that in the absence of an agreement
                        which provides satisfactory assurance that all States will abide by the
                        obligations they undertake, there is no real basis for securing a safe end
                        to the competition in the development of nuclear weapons. It is strange for
                        the Soviet Union, which first broke the truce on nuclear testing, now to
                        characterize any resumption of testing by the United States as an aggressive
                        act. It was resumption of testing by the Soviet Union which put this issue
                        back into the context of the arms race and that consequently forced the
                        United States to prepare to take such steps as may be necessary to insure
                        its own security. Any such steps could not be characterized now as
                        “aggressive acts.” They would be matter of prudent policy in the absence of
                        the effectively controlled nuclear test agreement that we have so earnestly
                        sought.</p>
                    <p>In our February 7 message, the Prime Minister and I attempted to layout a
                        further framework for the conduct of disarmament negotiations. We believe
                        that in a preliminary meeting among the Foreign Ministers of the US, UK and
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> views could be exchanged and
                        agreement reached on the three parallel approaches we suggested and on some
                        of the procedural aspects which we might jointly recommend to guide the
                        committee’s work. Such a discussion, together with the Statement of Agreed
                        Principles, could give a valuable direction and impetus to the committee’s
                        work.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chairman, I think you agree that we must approach this meeting with
                        utmost seriousness and dedication if we are to avoid a gradual drift to the
                        same kind of aimless and propaganda-oriented talk which has characterized so
                        much of past disarmament negotiations. This can be best achieved if we who
                        are ultimately responsible for the positions we take, and our chief
                        diplomatic officials, concern ourselves directly, as we are now doing, with
                        this subject. I believe we should consider most carefully as we proceed when
                        and how our actual participation at the conference table could be of most
                        benefit. End Verbatim Text.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have carefully studied your
                        message of February 25 last.<note n="1" xml:id="d39fn1">See <ref
                                target="#d38">Document 38</ref>.</note> Having thought about the
                        considerations advanced by you concerning the forthcoming negotiations in
                        the 18-Nation Disarmament Committee, I continue to adhere to the conviction
                        that personal participation of the most responsible state officials would be
                        particularly necessary in the initial stage, and I repeat—precisely in the
                        initial stage of negotiations, when their direction is being determined and,
                        consequently, their outcome is being predetermined to no small degree.</p>
                    <p>You know that disarmament negotiations have been continuing for a good
                        fifteen years, now becoming active, now dying out again, as if only to raise
                        the hopes of peoples to destroy these hopes again. All sorts of methods of
                        conducting such negotiations have been used: creation of various committees
                        and subcommittees, commissions and subcommissions, discussion of disarmament
                        questions in the halls of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and
                        exchange of views through diplomatic channels, but, as they say, the cart is
                        still stuck.</p>
                    <p>To what conclusions, then, does this lead? First of all that it would be at
                        least short-sighted again to rely on those methods that have already proven
                        their uselessness in the past and, secondly that it is the direct duty of
                        the states participating in disarmament negotiations to find new, more
                        reliable methods for conducting such negotiations. This is what the Soviet
                        Government did in addressing the Governments of all the countries included
                        in the 18-Nation Committee with the suggestion that the work of that
                        Committee be initiated at the highest level, with the participation of the
                        Heads of State or Government.</p>
                    <p>Our proposal was dictated by only one thing: by the desire to free
                        disarmament negotiations from the routine in which those negotiations became
                        entangled as soon as they started and to pave the way for an agreement on
                        general and complete disarmament. It would seem incontestable that those
                        state leaders who are vested with the broadest authority and occupy the most
                        responsible position in their country also have much greater possibilities
                        of coping with these difficult tasks. Therefore we regret that our proposal
                        to begin the work of the 18-Nation Committee at the highest level has not
                        met with understanding on your part. The <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110"
                            facs="0132"/>arguments advanced in your message are not capable of
                        affecting the weighty and serious considerations which speak in favor of the
                        fact that the course proposed by the Soviet Government is the best
                        course.</p>
                    <p>You yourself note the necessity of approaching the forthcoming negotiations
                        in the 18-Nation Committee with the utmost seriousness and purposefulness
                        and have come out in favor of the leading state officials devoting
                        undeviating attention to these negotiations. You also recognize that
                        personal participation of the heads of state in disarmament negotiations may
                        prove to be useful, although you adhere to the view that such participation
                        should be deferred to a later stage in the negotiations. In this connection
                        you express the hope that developments in the 18-Nation Committee and
                        internationally will make it useful to arrange for the personal
                        participation of the Heads of Government before June 1 of this year.</p>
                    <p>Thus, as a result of the exchange of messages among the leading officials of
                        states, general agreement has emerged with regard to the significance which
                        the disarmament negotiations in the 18-Nation Committee are acquiring. It is
                        no less important that everybody has now recognized the personal
                        responsibility of the Heads of Government and State for the success of these
                        negotiations and the necessity of direct participation by state officials of
                        the highest level in the work of the 18-Nation Disarmament Committee. We
                        take this as a definite step toward our position. In as much as the United
                        States and some of our other partners in the forthcoming negotiations are
                        not prepared for the time being to have the leading state officials
                        participate personally in the work of the 18-Nation Disarmament Committee
                        from the very beginning, we shall proceed, Mr. President, on the basis that
                        we both, as well as the leading state officials of the other states members
                        of the committee, will do that somewhat later.</p>
                    <p>The most important thing, of course, is to achieve results, to reach
                        agreement on general and complete disarmament, and, at every stage of the
                        negotiations, we shall do everything that depends on us in order to ensure
                        their success. Of course, we are in favor of fully utilizing the
                        possibilities of the Foreign Ministers, who can play their useful role if
                        all the participants in the 18-Nation Committee demonstrate the desire to
                        reach agreement on disarmament. The situation has developed in such a way
                        that the ministers are to be the first to set sail after the creation of the
                        18-Nation Committee. Well then, let us wish them success! Of course there is
                        no objection to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the United States and
                        the United Kingdom meeting, as you have proposed, with the Minister of
                        Foreign Affairs of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> before the
                        18-Nation Committee begins its work.</p>
                    <p>Your message also touches upon some questions relating to the substance of
                        the disarmament problem. In this connection I would like to make some
                        comments of my own.</p>
                    <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0133"/>
                    <p>First of all, a few words about verification. You believe that the
                        considerations set forth with regard to this point in my preceding message
                        are based on an “incorrect understanding of the United States position”.</p>
                    <p>I would only be glad if the position of the United States Government on the
                        question of control were actually to prove different from what we have
                        understood it to be until now. Unfortunately, however, there are no facts
                        which would provide grounds for such a conclusion.</p>
                    <p>The attitude of the Soviet Union toward the question of control has already
                        been covered in my preceding message of February 21 last.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d39fn2"><ref target="#d37">Document 37</ref>.</note> Is it
                        really necessary to repeat that the Soviet Union is for an honest agreement
                        on disarmament under strict international control. I can confirm once more
                        our repeated statements to the effect that the Soviet Union is prepared to
                        accept any proposals of the Western powers for control over disarmament if
                        the Western powers accept our proposals for general and complete
                        disarmament. If the United States Government is really concerned about how
                        to reach agreement on the establishment of control over disarmament, then
                        this readiness of ours removes a priori all difficulties, and there remains
                        no room for substantive differences.</p>
                    <p>Now about nuclear weapon tests. Let us talk plainly. I have just familiarized
                        myself with your statement in which you said that you had decided that the
                        United States would conduct, beginning in the latter part of April of this
                        year, a series of nuclear tests in the atmosphere. No matter how you try to
                        justify this decision, there cannot be two views about the fact that it
                        represents a new expression of the aggressive course in international
                        affairs, a blow to the 18-Nation Committee which is just about to begin its
                        work, and a blow to the forthcoming disarmament negotiations. No matter how
                        much you may try to prove the contrary, the shock wave from the American
                        nuclear tests in the Pacific Ocean will reach to the Palais des Nations at
                        Geneva.</p>
                    <p>You state that it is absolutely necessary for the United States to conduct
                        nuclear tests in order not to lag behind the Soviet Union. But you failed to
                        utter even one word about the fact that the United States and its <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies have conducted many more nuclear
                        test explosions than the Soviet Union. That is a fact, and everyone who does
                        not have as his specific objective to misinform world public opinion must be
                        aware of the fact that, if the United States and its allies add to the
                        nuclear tests already conducted another series of such tests for the purpose
                        of perfecting their nuclear weapons, then the Soviet Union will be faced
                        with the necessity of conducting such tests of new types of its nuclear
                        weapons as may be required under those conditions for the strengthening of
                        its security and the maintenance of world peace. Several months ago the
                        Soviet Union <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0134"/>was already compelled
                        to conduct such tests by the aggressive preparations of <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> states.</p>
                    <p>In asserting that the United States can in no way do without new nuclear
                        weapons tests, you leave much unsaid. After all, the effect of the action
                        planned by the Government of the United States cannot be limited merely to
                        those nuclear explosions that have been planned by the United States itself
                        or its allies in military blocs. No, you are beginning a new round of
                        competition in the creation of ever more lethal types of nuclear weapons and
                        you are unleashing, as it were, a chain reaction which, what is more, will
                        become ever more violent. And this is what you called in your message a
                        “reasonable policy!”</p>
                    <p>Where then, Mr. President, is logic? On the one hand you have repeatedly said
                        in your statements that the United States is superior to the Soviet Union
                        with regard to the power of nuclear weapons stockpiles. And your military
                        are openly boasting that they can allegedly wipe the Soviet Union and all
                        the countries of the Socialist camp from the face of the earth.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, you now say that the United States has to conduct nuclear
                        weapon tests for the alleged purpose of not lagging behind the Soviet Union
                        in armaments. These two things clearly do not jibe.</p>
                    <p>Your entire logic, Mr. President, adds up to the fact that you have now
                        announced the beginning of a new series of nuclear weapon tests by the
                        United States. But quite recently you and the entire Western press
                        argued—and argued correctly—how harmful such tests are. How much was said at
                        that time about the fact that nuclear tests contaminate the air, soil, and
                        vegetation, that radioactive fallout, together with contaminated plants
                        reaches the organism of animals, and particularly cows, and that such
                        fallout is transmitted through milk consumed by children.</p>
                    <p>But now it turns out that all these arguments were directed only against the
                        Soviet Union and were used merely for the purpose of enabling the United
                        States to preserve its superiority in certain types of armaments. And now
                        that you yourself have come to the conclusion that you need to conduct such
                        tests, where did those arguments go, where is that humanitarianism with
                        which you were so generous in your statements and messages? After the United
                        States has been accumulating huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons throughout
                        the post-war years who is to profit from new nuclear tests? Apparently this
                        is to the advantage of the monopolists who profit from the arms race, in
                        whom the desire for profit outweighs all the dangers connected with the
                        contamination of the atmosphere, the water, and the soil by radioactive
                        fallout.</p>
                    <p>Yet the people of the United States of America, just as all the peoples of
                        the world, are merely victims of the policy conducted in the interests of
                        monopolistic capital. On the one hand, nuclear weapons are being produced,
                        and the monopolies are profiting from their accumulation. On the <pb n="113"
                            xml:id="pg_113" facs="0135"/>other hand, by intimidating the world and
                        not lastly the people of their own country with these weapons, the
                        monopolists profit from the construction of shelters against such weapons
                        and in this manner the monopolies trim the income of the population and
                        mercilessly exploit the peoples.</p>
                    <p>It appears that all the talk about humanitarianism and love for one’s fellow
                        man ceases immediately as soon as the question of the monopolies’ profits
                        arises.</p>
                    <p>You and your allies in aggressive blocs justify your decision to begin new
                        nuclear tests with references to the Soviet Union’s having conducted such
                        tests. This argument does not stand up because the whole world knows it was
                        the United States of America which was the first to make the atom bomb and
                        that the first nuclear tests were also conducted by the United States of
                        America. Moreover, the United States has not only tested in the atmosphere
                        but has also exploded atom bombs over the Japanese cities of Nagasaki and
                        Hiroshima. It was precisely the United States and no one else who compelled
                        the Soviet Union to embark on the creation and accumulation of nuclear
                        weapons for the purpose of ensuring its security. Therefore, if one is to be
                        logical and if one is to strive sincerely for mutual understanding and
                        agreement on disarmament on the basis of equality, it is necessary to
                        recognize that the Soviet Union should be the last to terminate nuclear
                        weapon tests. The tests conducted by the Soviet Union were from the very
                        beginning merely actions in response to the nuclear arms race imposed by the
                        Western powers.</p>
                    <p>In your statement, Mr. President, you said that the United States would begin
                        tests in the atmosphere in the latter part of April. But in fact you have
                        already given the order to begin tests and you are delaying them by six or
                        eight weeks apparently only for the purpose of somehow preparing the world
                        public to swallow this bitter pill.</p>
                    <p>Of course you yourself understand that, if the United States begins
                        experimental explosions of nuclear weapons, then the Soviet Union, in the
                        interest of ensuring its security and world peace, will unquestionably be
                        compelled to respond to this too by conducting a series of new tests of its
                        own, And we do have the technical capabilities for this, and they are at
                        least equal to yours.</p>
                    <p>Consequently, with your tests you will start a new stage in the race in the
                        creation of deadly weapons. But we would like to compete with the United
                        States and other countries in the creation of better conditions for the
                        peaceful life of mankind, and we would like to unite efforts with you in the
                        cause of ensuring peace throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>The decision of the United States Government to conduct a new series of
                        nuclear tests spurs on the perfecting and the stockpiling of precisely those
                        types of modern weapons which represent the greatest danger: atomic and
                        hydrogen bombs, nuclear warheads for rockets, and <pb n="114"
                            xml:id="pg_114" facs="0136"/>rockets themselves. But, one may ask, what
                        is then to be negotiated in disarmament negotiations? Is it perhaps how many
                        machine guns and rifles should be scrapped, or by how many soldiers we
                        should reduce the guards around the arsenals where ever greater stockpiles
                        of nuclear and rocket weapons will continue to accumulate?</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the Soviet Union is expected to give an answer as to whether it is
                        prepared, before the United States begins its nuclear tests in April, to
                        agree to the provisions already rejected by us—of a treaty that would, under
                        the guise of international control over the cessation of tests, lead to the
                        creation of a ramified system of intelligence and espionage? I hope that
                        this is not expected of us; otherwise that would very much smack of atomic
                        blackmail. I am sure that you yourself know full well that such methods in
                        dealing with the Soviet Union have not yielded any results today, nor will
                        they tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Thus, as a result of the decision of the United States Government to conduct
                        a new series of nuclear tests, state officials, particularly of those
                        countries which bear the main responsibility for the preservation of peace
                        are faced with very serious questions including the question of the
                        prospects which await the 18-Nation Disarmament Committee. I consider it my
                        duty to tell you frankly about all this.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced that an end can be put to the unrestrained increase in the
                        power of nuclear weapons. It is precisely this objective that we pursue in
                        our recent proposals for the cessation of nuclear weapons tests, with which
                        you are familiar. It is conclusion of an agreement on the cessation of
                        nuclear tests, not their resumption, that would be a demonstration of the
                        reasonableness in policy of which you speak in your message.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully,</p>

                        common action in the exploration of space. I now present such proposals to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>The exploration of space is a broad and varied activity and the possibilities
                        for cooperation are many. In suggesting the possible first steps which are
                        set out below, I do not intend to limit our mutual consideration of
                        desirable cooperative activities. On the contrary, I will welcome your
                        concrete suggestions along these or other lines.</p>

                        <item>Perhaps we could render no greater service to mankind through our
                            space programs than by the joint establishment of an early operational
                            weather satellite system. Such a system would be designed to provide
                            global weather data for prompt use by any nation. To initiate this
                            service, I propose that the United States and the Soviet Union each
                            launch a satellite to photograph cloud cover and provide other agreed
                            meteorological services for all nations The two satellites would be
                            placed in near-polar orbits in planes approximately perpendicular to
                            each other, thus providing regular coverage of all areas. This immensely
                            valuable data would then be disseminated through normal international
                            meteorological channels and would make a significant contribution to the
                            research and service programs now under study by the World
                            Meteorological Organization in response to Resolution 1721 (XVI) adopted
                            by the United Nations General Assembly on December 20, 1961.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>It would be of great interest to those responsible for the conduct of
                            our respective space programs if they could obtain operational tracking
                            services from each other’s territories. Accordingly, I propose that each
                            of our countries establish and operate a radio tracking station to
                            provide tracking services to the other, utilizing equipment which we
                            would each provide to the other. Thus, the United States would provide
                            the technical equipment for a tracking station to be established in the
                            Soviet Union and to be operated by Soviet technicians. The United States
                            would in turn establish and operate a radio tracking station utilizing
                            Soviet equipment. Each country would train the other’s technicians in
                            the <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0139"/>operation of its equipment,
                            would utilize the station located on its territory to provide tracking
                            services to the other, and would afford such access as may be necessary
                            to accommodate modifications and maintenance of equipment from time to
                            time.</item>

                        <item>In the field of the earth sciences, the precise character of the
                            earth’s magnetic field is central to many scientific problems. I propose
                            therefore that we cooperate in mapping the earth’s magnetic field in
                            space by utilizing two satellites, one in a near-earth orbit and the
                            second in a more distant orbit. The United States would launch one of
                            these satellites, while the Soviet Union would launch the other. The
                            data would be exchanged throughout the world scientific community, and
                            opportunities for correlation of supporting data obtained on the ground
                            would be arranged.</item>

                        <item>In the field of experimental communications by satellite, the United
                            States has already undertaken arrangements to test and demonstrate the
                            feasibility of intercontinental transmissions. A number of countries are
                            constructing equipment suitable for participation in such testing. I
                            would welcome the Soviet Union’s joining in this cooperative effort
                            which will be a step toward meeting the objective, contained in United
                            Nations General Assembly Resolution 1721 (XVI), that communications by
                            means of satellites should be available to the nations of the world as
                            soon as practicable on a global and non-discriminatory basis. I note
                            also that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> has
                            broached the subject of cooperation in this field with Minister

                            Our technical representatives might now discuss specific possibilities
                            in this field.</item>

                        <item>Given our common interest in manned space flights and in insuring
                            man’s ability to survive in space and return safely, I propose that we
                            pool our efforts and exchange our knowledge in the field of space
                            medicine, where future research can be pursued in cooperation with
                            scientists from various countries.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Beyond these specific projects we are prepared now to discuss broader
                        cooperation in the still more challenging projects which must be undertaken
                        in the exploration of outer space. The tasks are so challenging, the costs
                        so great, and the risks to the brave men who engage in space exploration so
                        grave, that we must in all good conscience try every possibility of sharing
                        these tasks and costs and of minimizing these risks. Leaders of the United
                        States space program have developed detailed plans for an orderly sequence
                        of manned and unmanned flights for exploration of space and the planets. Out
                        of discussion of these plans, and of your own, for undertaking the tasks of
                        this decade would undoubtedly emerge possibilities for substantive
                        scientific and technical cooperation in manned and unmanned space
                        investigations. Some possibilities are not yet precisely identifiable, but
                        should become clear as <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0140"/>the space
                        programs of our two countries proceed. In the case of others it may be
                        possible to start planning together now. For example, we might cooperate in
                        unmanned exploration of the lunar surface, or we might commence now the
                        mutual definition of steps to be taken in sequence for an exhaustive
                        scientific investigation of the planets Mars or Venus, including
                        consideration of the possible utility of manned flight in such programs.
                        When a proper sequence for experiments has been determined, we might share
                        responsibility for the necessary projects. All data would be made freely
                        available.</p>
                    <p>I believe it is both appropriate and desirable that we take full cognizance
                        of the scientific and other contributions which other states the world over
                        might be able to make in such programs. As agreements are reached between us
                        on any parts of these or similar programs, I propose that we report them to
                        the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. The
                        Committee offers a variety of additional opportunities for joint cooperative
                        efforts within the framework of its mandate as set forth in General Assembly
                        Resolutions 1472 (XIV) and 1721 (XVI).</p>
                    <p>I am designating technical representatives who will be prepared to meet and
                        discuss with your representatives our ideas and yours in a spirit of
                        practical cooperation. In order to accomplish this at an early date, I
                        suggest that the representatives of our two countries who will be coming to
                        New York to take part in the United Nations Outer Space Committee meet
                        privately to discuss the proposals set forth in this letter.</p>

                        the German affairs <note n="1" xml:id="d42fn1"><ref target="#d34">Document

                            >862</ref>.</note> I regret that after so many meetings of our
                        representatives and in spite of our confidential communication, the
                        negotiations on the questions relating to German peaceful settlement do not
                        make any progress, to put it mildly. I have the impression that the American
                        side has not got rid of the preconception that under the peaceful settlement
                        which we seek somebody takes something, somebody gives—one takes an orchard
                        and gives an apple, or sells the same horse twice. To be frank, I simply do
                        not understand such an approach to the appraisal of the meaning of our
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the reason for that is that we look at things from different angles,
                        that we view the situation and the causes that have brought it about in a
                        different way and consequently we have different views on the methods of
                        eliminating the existing tension. If you could distract yourself from the
                        notions so deeply rooted overseas and look at the situation in the way we
                        see it after all we have lived through, you would probably see for yourself
                        that in a German peaceful settlement nobody sells or buys anything, nobody
                        trades unequal values.</p>
                    <p>No, from the point of view of common sense the situation here is quite clear.
                        A terrible blood-shedding war took place. The peoples of our countries
                        fought shoulder-to-shoulder against the common enemy—aggressive Hitlerite
                        Germany. By a supreme effort and at a cost of countless losses we achieved
                        the goal—defeated the enemy. By right of conquerors the four Allied
                        Powers—the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, Britain and France—occupied temporarily,
                        till the peace treaty is signed, the territory of Germany who had unleashed
                        World War II.</p>
                    <p>As a heritage from our predecessors we have got a delimitation of our troops,
                        which was not quite reasonable, and the division of Berlin into four parts.
                        I was told that when at the end of the war the plans of occupation of
                        Germany were discussed at the European Advisory Commission the British
                        proposed to seat the Allied Control Council not in Berlin but in a small
                        town at the juncture of the three occupation zones. That proposal motivated
                        by practical considerations was not accepted and it was decided to seat the
                        Control Council for symbolic reasons, in the capital of defeated Hitlerite
                        Germany.</p>
                    <p>Nobody could then envisage, of course, that there would be two Germanies and
                        the people acted at the time on the basis of the requirements of
                        organization of military occupation. It may serve as a certain excuse for
                        those who adopted decisions at that time.</p>
                    <p>But history does not always develop as the statesmen foresee. In reality it
                        turned out that there exist two Germanies. Neither you, Mr. President, nor I
                        know for how long the two German states that emerged on the ruins of the
                        Reich will exist, if they ever unite. And our sympathies for <pb n="120"
                            xml:id="pg_120" facs="0142"/>these states are not quite the same: you
                        sympathize with social and political system of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                            >FRG</gloss>, and I naturally sympathize with the German Democratic
                        Republic as a socialist state.</p>
                    <p>In addition there exists West Berlin. The population of this city lives under
                        old capitalist order while around it—on the territory of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>—socialist order has been established. And
                        here we are looking for a solution—how to ensure peaceful coexistence under
                        these circumstances.</p>
                    <p>You are well aware, Mr. President, that because of the absence of peaceful
                        settlement and the continuation of occupation West Berlin has for many years
                        been causing serious and dangerous frictions between us. I will not conceal
                        that when you insist on keeping your troops in West Berlin, we understand it
                        as an expression of a desire to preserve a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> beachhead and military base against us inside the <gloss
                            target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. We entered Berlin as allies but we are not
                        allies any longer. Moreover—we are in different military blocs—you are in
                        the North Atlantic bloc, we are in the Warsaw Treaty
                        Organization—organization of socialist countries. These two groups are
                        antagonistic because the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries
                        have formed their bloc against socialist countries. To protect our interests
                        we had to set up a defensive Warsaw Treaty Organization. What was left to be
                        done?</p>
                    <p>You note that the present situation in Germany is not satisfactory. This is
                        our point of view too. And what can we do now? Once upon a time, so the
                        story goes, two goats met head to head on a narrow bridge across an abyss.
                        They would not give the way to each other and down they fell. They were
                        stupid and stubborn animals.</p>
                    <p>But if we fail now to show sober understanding of the situation and do not
                        realize that we have to pass by each other in a friendly way and not to
                        collide at the place where, as you yourself emphasized, our essential
                        interests do not cross—then it will be difficult to take a reasonable
                        decision which would permit both sides to live calmly.</p>
                    <p>You often call West Berlin a stumbling block and say that until recently
                        everything was allegedly all right there. When we propose to sign a peace
                        treaty and to create a free demilitarized city in West Berlin granting its
                        population guarantees of free and independent life you assert that this is
                        abnormal. It means, that situation can be considered normal only when your
                        troops are stationed in West Berlin as occupants, when the state of war is
                        preserved there, and you do not want to participate in concluding a peace
                        treaty. But could it really be considered normal? This is against common
                        sense.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union proceeds from the necessity to find such a solution which
                        would not cause damage to either side; we must solve this whole problem
                        amicably and, having solved it, not collide with each other in the future.
                        In short, it is necessary to untie knots which create frictions between our
                        states.</p>
                    <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0143"/>
                    <p>I do not know, Mr. President, what else you could suggest as a solution of
                        this problem. My colleagues and I could not find anything better for the
                        improvement of post-war relations other than the conclusion of a German
                        peace treaty and the normalization of the situation in West Berlin on this
                        basis. To use the language of your representatives, we do not sell or buy
                        this city as a horse. We do not want to own this horse and it is not your
                        horse after all. It belongs to none of us.</p>
                    <p>West Berlin has turned out to be a capitalist island in the midst of
                        socialist countries. So, what! Let it remain such—we do not want to seize
                        this island or to liquidate the capitalist order which exists on it. Let it
                        be fixed what has been given by history.</p>
                    <p>You write in your message that two principles must be taken as a starting
                        point: (1) to avoid any shift favorable to one side and detrimental to the
                        other, and (2) to ensure a greater degree of stability and tranquility in
                        the entire German situation. If one adds to this that it is also necessary
                        to take into consideration the real situation in Germany, i.e. the existence
                        of the two German states—then one can say that these very principles form
                        the basis of the Soviet proposals on the conclusion of a German peace
                        treaty. The peace treaty should fix the situation which really exists,
                        should not allow to upset the established balance and should secure stable
                        peace and tranquility in Europe and not only in Europe.</p>
                    <p>One of the important aspects of such solution is the respect for the
                        sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic. No one demands from the
                        Western powers to do more than observe generally adopted norms of the
                        international law and international practice with regard to the <gloss
                            target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. One cannot ignore the dignity and
                        sovereign rights of a state, especially if one wants to use the routes of
                        communications crossing its territory as well as its services, if a display
                        of good will is expected from it. And it is impossible to achieve a peaceful
                        solution by pushing aggressive circles of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                            >FRG</gloss> to still new aggravations of the situation in the center of
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>You write that both sides should refrain from actions which would burden the
                        proceeding negotiations. This is a right idea. Unfortunately, the Western
                        powers are still trying in everything—both in major and in minor matters—to
                        ignore and tread on the rights of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.
                        The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council—not without the US
                        participation, one can assume—has even adopted a special decision
                        recommending the members of this bloc to deprive the citizens of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> of the possibility to have normal contacts
                        with many countries of the world. But what if the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss> in response to such a defiant decision forbade the citizens
                        of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries to go and to fly to
                        the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or anywhere through its territory?
                        The Western powers, evidently, would not like it, but that would be the
                        exercise by the German Democratic Republic of its sovereign right. Why,
                        then, do the <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0144"/><gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and its allies consider it possible to hold
                        such a position towards the German Democratic Republic?</p>
                    <p>Or, perhaps, one should regard as a contribution to the solution of the
                        questions discussed by us the endless and—let us call a spade a
                        spade—provocative visits by politicians of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                            >FRG</gloss> and other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries
                        to West Berlin? I do not wish to go into polemics now and therefore I will
                        not refer to many well known facts.</p>
                    <p>You, Mr. President, in your message, and also the US Ambassador when he
                        called on the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> touched upon the question of the flights of Soviet
                        aircraft in the air routes leading to West Berlin over the territory of the
                            <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. In so doing the American side tries
                        to create an impression as if the Soviet aircraft make “aggressive
                        harassment” to the flights of the aircraft of the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                            >USA</gloss>, Britain and France to West Berlin. I see no necessity to
                        dwell on this question: the actual situation and our position are
                        undoubtedly well known to the US Government. This position is based entirely
                        on the corresponding international agreements and on the practice of use of
                        these air routes.</p>
                    <p>There seems to be somebody’s hand in this artificial heating up of the
                        atmosphere around the Berlin air routes. To our mind, the best thing to do
                        would be not to encourage certain hot-heads in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>, especially among the military, but to cool them off so
                        that they realize at last that no instigating actions can change the
                        situation and deprive the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic of
                        what they possess. Abandoning by the Western powers of their attempts to
                        violate the lawful interests of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would constitute that very
                        abstention from unilateral actions, creating the danger of outbreak of
                        serious incidents, which the US Government calls for.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, it is very difficult to find in the document handed by
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> on March 6 a
                        desire to facilitate an agreement. There is, however, a statement in it to
                        the effect that the US stands for the achievement of a just and peaceful
                        settlement of disputed questions dividing our countries. This statement is
                        correct, but, unfortunately, it is not substantiated in the negotiations in
                        order to achieve the necessary agreement.</p>
                    <p>I would not like to leave anything unclear—one way or another we will sign a
                        German peace treaty. I have already said in Vienna and repeat it now that if
                        there is no other choice we will make use of the US example and the lesson
                        which was taught us by it in case with Japan. Some hot-heads occupying
                        official positions in the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> are
                        threatening us with various misfortunes, but I think they are more clever in
                        their doings than in their words because only suicides can now threaten with
                        war but suicides are always insane people. I, for myself, consider that our
                        counterparts with whom we conduct conversation are mentally normal people
                            <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0145"/>and can realistically evaluate
                        and understand what it would mean to attack the Soviet Union or another
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Some people allege that we are attacking someone, demanding a peaceful German
                        settlement. But no sane person can consider as an attack the talks on the
                        conclusion of a peace treaty. And the conclusion of a peace treaty means
                        putting an end not only to the state of war but also to the state of
                        hostility which results from an unaccomplished peaceful settlement.</p>
                    <p>I believe that we, the men vested with great trust and responsibility by our
                        peoples, should understand all this correctly and should oppose opinions
                        which sometimes push us to the wrong way. To say it straight: let us not
                        frighten each other with words. We have seen enough of frightening. You, Mr.
                        President, participated in the World War II, I participated not only in that
                        war. Both of us are aware what war means and as the leaders of states we
                        know what military means are now at the disposal of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                            >USA</gloss>. Let us not count by pieces who has more or who has fewer
                        modern means of mass destruction. Each of our countries has already
                        stock-piled more than enough means to inflict an irreparable devastating
                        blow.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union intends to conclude a German peace treaty. If we do not find
                        common language with you and you yourself do not want to take part in the
                        peaceful settlement then the Soviet Union and other states will sign the
                        peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>My colleagues and I have much pondered—how to bring closer our positions on
                        the questions under discussion including the problem of ensuring a free
                        access to West Berlin. Your recent letter, in which certain ideas on this
                        point are expressed, strengthened my intention to share with you the
                        considerations that we have arrived at on the creation of an international
                        organ on the access to West Berlin. I hope that the ideas that I am
                        expressing here will be received with good will, without prejudice.</p>
                    <p>Specifically I have in mind the following:</p>
                    <p>We are prepared to meet halfway the desire expressed by you and to agree to
                        the creation of a special international organ on the access to West Berlin
                        for the period of time that will be defined by the agreement between us. The
                        organ that I have in mind would act as an arbiter if difficulties appeared
                        during the practical implementation of the agreements on free access to and
                        from West Berlin. It would not be empowered with any administrative
                        functions which would give it authority to directly regulate traffic or set
                        its own regulations on the traffic routes connecting West Berlin with the
                        outside world because this is a prerogative of the German Democratic
                        Republic. In brief, any talk of an organ of the kind proposed by the
                        American side at the negotiations in Moscow, which would be a kind of state
                        within state is out of question. Such situation would be in basic
                        contradiction with the most elementary concepts of respect for the<pb
                            n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0146"/>sovereignty of states. From the
                        remarks made by the American side you also, it seems to me, see the
                        necessity to take this aspect of the matter into consideration.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, the creation of the international organ on the access to West
                        Berlin that I have in mind is possible only under the condition that the
                        troops which are now stationed there by virtue of occupation are withdrawn
                        from West Berlin as a result of the conclusion of a peace treaty. We
                        consider that for West Berlin itself it would be calmer and better if there
                        were no foreign troops stationed there at all. However, you say, you have
                        some doubts—would not some harm be done to the population of West Berlin on
                        the part of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Although we have
                        repeatedly explained that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> does not
                        and cannot have such aims, we are nevertheless ready to agree to stationing
                        in West Berlin for some period of time, let us say for 3-5 years, symbolic
                        contingents of troops of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or neutral
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>All this, of course, is connected with the transformation of West Berlin into
                        a free demilitarized city and with the simultaneous achievement of an
                        agreement on final legalization and consolidation of the existing German
                        borders and also on other questions which are well known to you and which
                        you mention in your message.</p>
                    <p>Such an arrangement could then be fixed in a peace treaty with the German
                        Democratic Republic (or in an annex to it), which will be concluded by the
                        Soviet Union and a number of other states, if the Western powers have
                        definitively decided that at the present time they will not take part in a
                        German peaceful settlement.</p>
                    <p>Under an agreed solution of all these problems a part of which would be an
                        agreement on the creation of an international organ on the access to West
                        Berlin, such access through the territory of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss> would be exercised on the basis of agreements, that is with
                        the observance of usual regulations and formalities which are applied to the
                        transit through the territory of sovereign states. We know that the <gloss
                            target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is ready to assume in an appropriate form
                        the obligations providing for an unimpeded access to and from West Berlin.
                        Should any complications or frictions in the exercise of a free access to
                        West Berlin arise, the last word would be with the international
                        organ—arbiter of which we have said above.</p>
                    <p>The international organ would include, first of all, the four powers—the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the US, Britain and France. Thus
                        the Soviet Union would act in capacity of a guarantor of a free and
                        uninterrupted access to West Berlin to which, judging by everything, the
                        Western powers attach particular importance. As to other possible
                        participants of the international organ, this question could be solved later
                        by the agreement of the parties.</p>
                    <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0147"/>
                    <p>What is the advantage of a decision that I have just outlined? In a sense
                        this is an alloy of the two positions—American and Soviet. On one hand, the
                        Soviet Government, though it is not so simple for us, agrees to the creation
                        of an international organ on access. On the other hand, an agreement will be
                        reached—if the US is not ready yet to conclude a peace treaty with both
                        German states—that with the conclusion by the Soviet Union and by a number
                        of other states of a peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss> the situation in West Berlin is normalized on this basis by
                        transforming it into a free demilitarized city in accordance with our mutual
                        agreement, and other questions which you know are being solved. That would
                        be a great victory for the cause of consolidating peace and easing
                        tension.</p>
                    <p>This is a reasonable proposal and if we could reach an agreement on its basis
                        it would help us to take off the existing heat in international relations.
                        Our proposal is a concession to you. We do not want to create difficulties
                        for you, Mr. President, and your country because in your country there are
                        hot-heads; maybe there are some among your allies too. These questions are
                        correctly understood in our country and by our allies. Let us leave the
                        troops of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or neutral countries in a
                        free city of West Berlin for 3-5 years to allow the nerves to cool down
                        during this period of time and then the whole situation will look in a quite
                        different light.</p>
                    <p>I hope that the thoughts, expressed by me, will allow us to concentrate our
                        attention in the course of the talks on the main questions and to achieve a
                        necessary progress in the nearest future.</p>
                    <p>It was my intention to dwell upon in this message only the German peace
                        treaty. But in the meantime I was informed about the confidential
                        conversation with your brother, <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert
                            Kennedy</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">Not further
                            identified.</note></p>
                    <p>He said that since we had not achieved any progress on Berlin question, you,
                        Mr. President, consider it necessary to make an effort to find the areas
                        wherein the soonest achievement of an agreement with the Soviet Union is
                        possible. And you, according to Mr.<persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert
                            Kennedy</persName>, think that such area is the disarmament problem and,
                        first of all, the question of the nuclear test ban.</p>
                    <p>I would have understood such a position of yours, let us say, a few days ago.
                        But, how, may I ask you, should we understand it now, when you have made a
                        decision to resume nuclear weapon tests <note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">On March
                            2 President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> had
                            authorized the resumption of nuclear testing.</note> and especially on
                        the eve of the conference where we are to deal with the disarmament
                        questions. I have expressed my attitude towards your decision with full
                        frankness in my message of March 3.<note n="5" xml:id="d42fn5"><ref
                                target="#d39">Document 39</ref>.</note> What was said there may seem
                        harsh to you, but had I given another evaluation of such a step by the US
                        Government I would have been simply insincere.</p>
                    <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0148"/>
                    <p>Your brother expressed the thought that our Ministers should discuss at
                        Geneva the possibilities of an accommodation on the question of the nuclear
                        test ban. As you already know from my recent message we have agreed that our
                        Minister will participate in the work of 18 nation conference though I do
                        not conceal that if you start series of nuclear explosions, it will
                        certainly not increase chances for success in the Committee’s work. We, you
                        and I, must look at the course of events realistically.</p>
                    <p>Your brother said that you, Mr. President, would like to have a summit
                        meeting, which could be prepared in advance by the Ministers of Foreign
                        Affairs or through diplomatic channels. I also would believe that such a
                        meeting with you would be useful if an accommodation on a number of
                        questions is reached before it by our Ministers, that is if the questions
                        are prepared for their final discussion, approval and formalizing at the
                        meeting of the Heads of State. I am always ready for such a meeting in order
                        to ensure a necessary accommodation. When I am speaking about such a meeting
                        at the highest level I believe that both our peoples are equally interested
                        in it. After all, when the fate of the mankind is at stake, we as statesmen
                        must use all the opportunities to justify the great trust placed upon us. It
                        certainly happens sometimes that efforts of Ministers alone are not enough
                        and then for the sake of success and in the interests of peace the heads of
                        state and government have to join the effort.</p>
                    <p>Our new Ambassador, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">A.F. Dobrynin</persName>,
                        will soon arrive in Washington. I recommend him to you and I am confident
                        that he will represent the Soviet Union in your country well. He enjoys the
                        full confidence of the Soviet Government and my full confidence. Whenever
                        you need to convey something to me in a confidential way he will be able to
                        transmit this to me personally.</p>
                    <p>I would like to thank you for your kind and warm words passed to me through

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: Having carefully familiarized
                        myself with your message of March 7 <note n="1" xml:id="d43fn1"><ref
                                target="#d41">Document 41</ref>.</note> of this year, I note with
                        satisfaction that my communication to you of February 21 <note n="2"
                            xml:id="d43fn2"><ref target="#d35">Document 35</ref>.</note> containing
                        the proposal that our two countries unite their efforts for the conquest of
                        space has met with the necessary understanding on the part of the Government
                        of the United States.</p>
                    <p>In advancing this proposal, we proceeded from the fact that all peoples and
                        all mankind are interested in achieving the objective of exploration and
                        peaceful use of outer space, and that the enormous scale of this task, as
                        well as the enormous difficulties which must be overcome, urgently demand
                        broad unification of the scientific, technical, and material capabilities
                        and resources of nations. Now, at a time when the space age is just dawning,
                        it is already evident how much man will be called upon to accomplish. If
                        today the genius of man has created space ships capable of reaching the
                        surface of the moon with great accuracy and of launching the first
                        cosmonauts into orbit around the earth, then tomorrow manned spacecraft will
                        be able to race to Mars and Venus, and the farther they travel the wider and
                        more immense the prospects will become for man’s penetration into the depths
                        of the universe.</p>
                    <p>The greater the number of countries making their contribution to this truly
                        complicated endeavor, which involves great expense, the more swiftly will
                        the conquest of space in the interests of all humanity proceed. And this
                        means that equal opportunities should be made available for all countries to
                        participate in international cooperation in this field. It is precisely this
                        kind of international cooperation that the Soviet Union unswervingly
                        advocates, true to its policy of developing and strengthening friendship
                        between peoples. As far back as the beginning of 1958 the Soviet Government
                        proposed the conclusion of a broad international agreement on cooperation in
                        the field of the study and peaceful use of outer space and took the
                        initiative in raising this question for examination by the United Nations.
                        In 1961, immediately after the first space flight by man had been achieved
                        in the Soviet Union, we reaffirmed our readiness to cooperate and unite our
                        efforts with those of other countries, and most of all with your country,
                        which was then making preparations <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0150"
                        />for similar flights. My message to you of February 21, 1962 was dictated
                        by these same aspirations and directed toward this same purpose.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government considers and has always considered the successes of
                        our country in the field of space exploration as achievements not only of
                        the Soviet people but of all mankind. The Soviet Union is taking practical
                        steps to the end that the fruits of the labor of Soviet scientists shall
                        become the property of all countries. We widely publish notification of all
                        launchings of satellites, spaceships and space rockets, reporting all data
                        pertaining to the orbit of flight, weight of space devices launched, radio
                        frequencies, etc.</p>
                    <p>Soviet scientists have established fruitful professional contacts with their
                        foreign colleagues, including scientists of your country, in such
                        international organizations as the Committee for Outer Space Research and
                        the International Astronautical Federation.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me, Mr. President, that the necessity is now generally recognized
                        for further practical steps in the noble cause of developing international
                        cooperation in space research for peaceful purposes. Your message shows that
                        the direction of your thoughts does not differ in essence from what we
                        conceive to be practical measures in the field of such cooperation. What,
                        then, should be our starting point?</p>
                    <p>In this connection I should like to name several problems of research and
                        peaceful use of space, for whose solution it would in our opinion be
                        important to unite the efforts of nations. Some of them, which are
                        encompassed by the recent U.N. General Assembly resolution adopted at the
                        initiative of our two countries, are also mentioned in your message.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>Scientists consider that the use of artificial earth satellites for
                            the creation of international systems of long-distance communication is
                            entirely realistic at the present stage of space research. Realization
                            of such projects can lead to a significant improvement in the means of
                            communication and television all over the globe. People would be
                            provided with a reliable means of communication and hitherto unknown
                            opportunities for broadening contacts between nations would be opened.
                            So let us begin by specifying the definite opportunities for cooperation
                            in solving this problem. As I understood from your message, the U.S.A.
                            is also prepared to do this.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>It is difficult to overestimate the advantage that people would derive
                            from the organisation of a world-wide weather observation service using
                            artificial earth satellites. Precise and timely weather prediction would
                            be still another important step on the path to man’s subjugation of the
                            forces of nature; it would permit him to combat more successfully the
                            calamities of the elements and would give new prospects for advancing
                            the well-being of mankind. Let us also cooperate in this field.</item>

                        <item><p>It seems to us that it would be expedient to agree upon organising
                                the observation of objects launched in the direction of the moon,

                                radio-technical and optical means, through a joint program.</p>
                            <p>As our scientists see it, undoubted advantage would be gained by
                                uniting the efforts of nations for the purpose of hastening
                                scientific progress in the study of the physics of interplanetary
                                space and heavenly bodies.</p></item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>At the present stage of man’s penetration into space, it would be most
                            desirable to draw up and conclude an international agreement providing
                            for aid in searching for and rescuing space ships, satellites, and
                            capsules that have accidentally fallen. Such an agreement appears all
                            the more necessary, since it might involve saving the lives of
                            cosmonauts, those courageous explorers of the far reaches of the
                            universe.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Your message contains proposals for cooperation between our countries
                            in compiling charts of the earth’s magnetic field in outer space by
                            means of satellites, and also for exchanging knowledge in the field of
                            space medicine. I can say that Soviet scientists are prepared to
                            cooperate in this and to exchange data regarding such questions with
                            scientists of other countries.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>I think, Mr. President, that the time has also come for our two
                            countries, which have advanced further than others in space research, to
                            try to find a common approach to the solution of the important legal
                            problems with which life itself has confronted the nations in the space
                            age. In this connection I find it a positive fact that at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly’s 16th session the
                            Soviet Union and the United States were able to agree upon a proposal on
                            the first principles of space law which was then unanimously approved by
                            the members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>: a proposal on the
                            applicability of international law, including the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Charter, in outer space and on heavenly bodies; on the
                            accessibility of outer space and heavenly bodies for research and use by
                            all nations in accordance with international law; and on the fact that
                            space is not subject to appropriation by nations.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Now, in our opinion, it is necessary to go further.</p>
                    <p>Expansion of space research being carried out by nations definitely makes it
                        necessary to agree also that in conducting experiments in outer space no one
                        should create obstacles for space study and research for peaceful purposes
                        by other nations. Perhaps it should be stipulated that those experiments in
                        space that might complicate space research by other countries should be the
                        subject of preliminary discussion and agreement on an appropriate
                        international basis.</p>
                    <p>I have named, Mr. President, only some of the questions whose solution has,
                        in our view, now become urgent and requires cooperation between our
                        countries. In the future, international cooperation in the <pb n="130"
                            xml:id="pg_130" facs="0152"/>conquest of space will undoubtedly extend
                        to ever newer fields of space exploration if we can now lay a firm
                        foundation for it. We hope that scientists of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> and the U.S.A. will be able to engage in working out and
                        realizing the many projects for the conquest of outer space hand in hand,
                        and together with scientists of other countries.</p>
                    <p>Representatives of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Space Committee will be given instructions to
                        meet with representatives of the United States in order to discuss concrete
                        questions of cooperation in research and peaceful use of outer space that
                        are of interest to our countries.</p>
                    <p>Thus, Mr. President, do we conceive of—shall we say—heavenly matters. We
                        sincerely desire that the establishment of cooperation in the field of
                        peaceful use of outer space facilitate the improvement of relations between
                        our countries, the easing of international tension and the creation of a
                        favorable situation for the peaceful settlement of urgent problems here on
                        our own earth.</p>
                    <p>At the mean time it appears obvious to me that the scale of our cooperation
                        in the peaceful conquest of space, as well as the choice of the lines along
                        which such cooperation would seem possible, is to a certain extent related
                        to the solution of the disarmament problem. Until an agreement on general
                        and complete disarmament is achieved, both our countries will, nevertheless,
                        be limited in their abilities to cooperate in the field of peaceful use of
                        outer space. It is no secret that rockets for military purposes and
                        spacecraft launched for peaceful purposes are based on common scientific and
                        technical achievements. It is true that there are some distinctions here;
                        space rockets require more powerful engines, since by this means they carry
                        greater payloads and attain a higher altitude, while military rockets in
                        general do not require such powerful engines—engines already in existence
                        can carry warheads of great destructive force and assure their arrival at
                        any point on the globe. However, both you and we know, Mr. President, that
                        the principles for designing and producing military rockets and space
                        rockets are the same.</p>
                    <p>I am expressing these considerations for the simple reason that it would be
                        better if we saw all sides of the question realistically. We should try to
                        overcome any obstacles which may arise in the path of international
                        cooperation in the peaceful conquest of space. It is possible that we shall
                        succeed in doing this, and that will be useful. Considerably broader
                        prospects for cooperation and uniting our scientific-technological
                        achievements up to and including joint construction of spacecraft for
                        reaching other planets—the moon, Venus, Mars—will arise when agreement on
                        disarmament has been achieved.</p>
                    <p>We hope that agreement on general and complete disarmament will be achieved;
                        we are exerting and will continue to exert every effort toward <pb n="131"
                            xml:id="pg_131" facs="0153"/>this end. I should like to believe that you
                        also, Mr. President, will spare no effort in acting along these lines.</p>

                    <p>“Joint US/UK Statement on Nuclear Testing”</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Begin Verbatim Text</hi></p>
                    <p>Discussions among ourselves and the Soviet Union about a treaty to ban
                        nuclear tests have been going on in Geneva for nearly a month. The Soviet
                        representatives have rejected international inspection or verification
                        inside the Soviet Union to determine the nature of unexplained seismic
                        events which might be nuclear tests.</p>
                    <p>This is a point of cardinal importance to the United States and the United
                        Kingdom. From the very beginning of the negotiations on a nuclear Test Ban
                        Treaty, they have made it clear that an essential element of such a treaty
                        is an objective international system for assuring that a ban on nuclear
                        tests is being observed by all parties. The need for such a system was
                        clearly recognized in the report of the scientific experts which was the
                        foundation of the Geneva negotiations. For nearly three years this need was
                        accepted by the Soviet delegation at Geneva. There was disagreement about
                        details, but the principle of objective international <pb n="132"
                            xml:id="pg_132" facs="0154"/>verification was accepted. It was embodied
                        in the Treaty tabled by the United States and the United Kingdom on April
                        18, 1961, which provides for such a system. Since the current disarmament
                        meetings began in Geneva, the United States and the United Kingdom have made
                        further efforts to meet Soviet objections to the April 18 Treaty. These
                        efforts have met with no success as is clearly shown by the recent
                        statements of the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union and of their
                        representative in Geneva, Mr. <persName>Zorin</persName>, who have
                        repeatedly rejected the very concept of international verification. There
                        has been no progress on this point in Geneva; the Soviet Union has refused
                        to change its position.</p>
                    <p>The ground given seems to be that existing national detection systems can
                        give adequate protection against clandestine tests. In the pres-ent state of
                        scientific instrumentation, there are a great many cases in which we cannot
                        distinguish between natural and artificial seismic disturbances—as opposed
                        to recording the fact of a disturbance and locating its probable epicenter.
                        A treaty therefore cannot be made effective unless adequate verification is
                        included in it. For otherwise there would be no alternative, if an
                        instrument reported an unexplained seismic occurrence on either side,
                        between accepting the possibility of an evasion of the Treaty or its
                        immediate denunciation. The opportunity for adequate verification is of the
                        very essence of mutual confidence.</p>
                    <p>This principle has so far been rejected by the Foreign Minister of the Soviet
                        Union, and there is no indication that he has not spoken with the full
                        approval of his Government. We continue to hope that the Soviet Government
                        may reconsider the position and express their readiness to accept the
                        principle of international verification. If they will do this, there is
                        still time to reach agreement. But if there is no change in the present
                        Soviet position, the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom
                        must conclude that their efforts to obtain a workable treaty to ban nuclear
                        tests are not now successful, and the test series scheduled for the latter
                        part of this month will have to go forward. End Verbatim Text.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President, Good news has come from Laos. As a result of the
                        successful completion of negotiations between the three political forces of
                        Laos, it has been possible to form a coalition Government of National Unity
                        headed by <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Prince Souvanna Phouma</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Without question, this act may become the pivotal event both in the life of
                        the Laotian people themselves and in the cause of strengthening peace in
                        Southeast Asia. Formation of a coalition Government of National Unity in
                        Laos opens the way toward completing in the near future the work done at the
                        Geneva Conference toward a peaceful settlement of the Laotian problem and
                        giving life to the agreements worked out at that conference, which
                        constitute a good basis for the development of Laos as a neutral and
                        independent state.</p>
                    <p>The example of Laos indicates that provided there is a desire to resolve
                        difficult international problems on the basis of cooperation with mutual
                        account of the interests of all sides, such cooperation bears its fruit. At
                        the same time, the results achieved in the settlement of the Laotian problem
                        strengthen the conviction that success in solving other international
                        problems which now divide states and create tension in the world can be
                        achieved on the same road as well.</p>
                    <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0157"/>
                    <p>As for the Soviet Government, it has always adhered, as it does now, to this
                        line, which in present conditions is the only correct policy in
                        international affairs in accordance with the interests of peace.</p>
                    <p>I avail myself of the occasion to express satisfaction over the fact that the
                        mutual understanding we achieved while meeting in Vienna last June on the
                        support of a neutral and independent Laos is beginning to be translated into
                        life.</p>

                        morning Moscow time.</p>
                    <p>"Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I share your view that the reports from Laos are very encouraging. The
                        formation of this Government of National Union under <persName
                            corresp="#p_SP2">Prince Souvanna Phouma</persName> marks a milestone in
                        the sustained efforts which have been put forward toward this end,
                        especially since our meeting in Vienna.</p>
                    <p>It is of equal importance that we should now press forward with our
                        associates in the Geneva Conference, to complete these agreements and to
                        work closely together in their execution. We must continue also to do our
                        best to persuade all concerned in Laos to work together to this same end. It
                        is very important that no untoward actions be allowed to disrupt the
                        progress which has been made.</p>
                    <p>I agree that continued progress in the settlement of the Laotian problem can
                        be most helpful in leading toward the resolution of other international <pb
                            n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0158"/>difficulties. If together we can
                        help in the establishment of an independent and neutral Laos, securely
                        sustained in this status through time, this accomplishment will surely have
                        a significant and positive effect far beyond the borders of Laos. You can
                        count on the continued and energetic efforts of the Government of the United
                        States toward this end.</p>

                    <p>We are following with great attention the development of the Soviet-American
                        exchange of opinions on German peace treaty and normalization on its basis
                        of the situation in West Berlin and we are carefully weighing considerations
                        being expressed by the President, the Secretary of State or on behalf of the
                        President through unofficial channels.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, we, naturally, cannot but take notice of the facts which
                        indicate sharpening of the situation in West Berlin caused by activities of
                        certain circles not interested in a German peace settlement. Other facts of
                        recent past also support repeatedly voiced apprehensions that the absence of
                        a final peace settlement in Germany not only keeps up the existing tension
                        in Europe but can also cause unforeseen, undesirable consequences for
                        European and world peace.</p>
                    <p>All this prompts the conclusion that further delay in solving the questions
                        connected with a German peace settlement would involve such a threat to
                        peace which must be averted already now when it is not too late.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately in the course of the Soviet-American exchange of opinions there
                        has not been achieved any noticeable progress since the meetings in Geneva.
                        The whole matter has come to a standstill because of the differences in the
                        main outstanding question—that of withdrawal of the occupation troops of the
                        U.S., Great Britain and France from West Berlin and of abolition there of
                        the occupation states. Motives were more than once given in detail on our
                        side why we by no means can accept continuation of the present
                        unsatisfactory and dangerous situation in West Berlin, the reason for which
                        lies in the presence there of occupation troops and occupation regime
                        covering in effect the existence of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>

                        territory.</p>
                    <p>We have set forth a number of concrete proposals which took into account the
                        official position and motives of prestige of the U.S. on this main subject
                        of disagreement. The President’s considerations on the necessity to search

                        American side which would enhance the possibility for solving the question
                        of drawing a line through World War II by abolishing the occupation regime
                        in West Berlin and by giving it the status of a free city. The expressed
                        considerations about some temporary settlement of the question, so far as
                        they do not provide for abolition of the occupation regime and withdrawal of
                        the occupation troops of the three powers from West Berlin, cannot,
                        naturally, make an agreement easier. Since the whole matter is that of
                        eliminating the vestiges of the war it is absolutely impossible to accept
                        mere formal changes in West Berlin without really changing the existing
                        abnormal situation there which is fraught with possibility of a sudden
                        explosion.</p>
                    <p>Both we and you had enough time for thinking this over. And if both of us are
                        ready to really search for a solution then there are no reasons not to find
                        it in the nearest future, without further procrastination. There is
                        absolutely no sense in postponing until fall, and from fall until spring
                        what should and can be done already now.</p>
                    <p>It can be seen from the last talk of Mr.<persName corresp="#p_SPEG1"
                            >Salinger</persName> with our Ambassador <note n="1" xml:id="d49fn1"
                            >This conversation has not been further identified.</note> that the
                        President shares the view that it is not expedient to postpone solution of
                        the German problem and that he takes interest in finding a mutually
                        acceptable solution on the main unresolved question—that of the foreign
                        troops in West Berlin. Those proposals which we set forth before in our
                        conviction fully correspond to the interests of both sides. But in order to
                        speed up the solution and make a choice out of the alternatives that we face
                        we are ready to make another effort that in the greatest possible degree
                        takes into account the wishes of the United States on the question of the
                        presence of its troops in West Berlin so far as those wishes are compatible
                        with the task of completing a German peace settlement.</p>
                    <p>Our proposal is as follows.</p>
                    <p>The occupation regime in West Berlin will be abolished and during the first
                        years the troops of the United Nations will be stationed there which will
                        act as guarantors of independence and security of West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Those <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops must not, naturally, either
                        taken as a whole or in any of their part, represent this or that military
                        group opposing each other and their status as guarantors acting in the name
                        of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should be defined on the basis of a
                        special agreement. They would symbolize the determination of the parties to
                        the agreement not to permit outside interference into the affairs and life
                        of the population of West Berlin. Those troops by their nature would be
                        police formation and not combatant troops, that should be agreed upon.</p>
                    <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0161"/>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> police military formations, the initial
                        strength of which should not exceed the combined strength of the troops of
                        the three powers stationed there as of July 1, 1962, would be composed of
                        police military formations of the U.S., Great Britain and France which
                        combined will make one half of such U.S. formations in West Berlin; the
                        other half of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> police military formations
                        will consist in an equal proportion of contingents of troops of one or two
                        neutral states, one or two states of the Warsaw treaty (for example, Poland,
                        Czechoslovakia), one or two small <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        states.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently the numerical strength of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        police military formations in West Berlin will gradually diminish, namely:
                        during the first year after the abolition of the occupation status those
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> formations will be cut by 25 per cent
                        of their initial strength, during the second year—by another 25 per cent and
                        during the third year by next 25 per cent of that number. The above
                        mentioned gradual reduction of the numerical strength of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> formations will be carried on in the same
                        proportion both with regard to the police military formations of the three
                        powers and the formations that will be provided by other states.</p>
                    <p>Since the sides agree that the presence of foreign troops in West Berlin
                        should be of temporary nature they make an arrangement that by the end of
                        the fourth year the remaining 25 per cent of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> police formations will be withdrawn from West Berlin, and
                        West Berlin will be free of the presence of foreign troops. We proceed from
                        an assumption that after the withdrawal of those formations the guarantees
                        by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in respect to independence of West
                        Berlin that would guard that city from outside interference into its
                        domestic affairs should remain fully in force.</p>
                    <p>With the abolition of occupation status West Berlin will be considered as an
                        independent political entity, that is, as a free city. Subversive activities
                        must not be carried on from West Berlin against the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss> or other socialist countries.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, any claims by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on West
                        Berlin must be declined for they constitute a manifestation of the policy of
                        aggression and revanche in practice. We are generally satisfied that our
                        positions regarding groundlessness of any claims by the <gloss
                            target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on West Berlin are in effect the same. An
                        appropriate agreement will also be achieved on free access to and from West
                        Berlin with due respect for the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss> on the basis of generally established international
                        practice. The German Democratic Republic, as it has already stated, will
                        assume appropriate commitments on this question. We on our part again
                        reaffirm that we have stood and continue to stand for an unimpeded access
                        provided the requirement to respect the lawful sovereign rights of the
                        German Democratic Republic is observed.</p>
                    <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0162"/>
                    <p>If differences or frictions arise on practical questions of access they will
                        be considered by a special temporary international body—an arbitrator about
                        which the Soviet side put forward corresponding proposals.</p>
                    <p>Simultaneously with the normalization of the situation in West Berlin and
                        abolition there of the occupation regime other questions of a German peace
                        settlement should be finally solved, such as: fixation and juridical
                        formalization of the existing borders of the German states, the border
                        between the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                            >FRG</gloss> included, nonarming of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> with nuclear
                        weapons (either directly, or through third countries, or through
                        military-political groups in which they are participants), due respect for
                        the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, conclusion in
                        one form or another of a nonaggression pact between the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw treaty organization. An
                        understanding on all those questions should, naturally, be formalized in
                        appropriate agreements.</p>
                    <p>The agreement achieved by the sides on appropriate questions will find its
                        reflection in a peace treaty which the Soviet Union and other interested
                        states will conclude with the German Democratic Republic.</p>
                    <p>Setting forth the new proposal on the question of foreign troops in West
                        Berlin which we believe is paving the way to a mutually acceptable agreement
                        and which we hope the President will duly appreciate we proceed from an
                        assumption that as the American side has repeatedly emphasized a solution of
                        all other questions of a German peace settlement which were discussed will
                        not run into obstacles.</p>
                    <p>We would like the American side to correctly understand the motives and aims
                        of this new proposal. We deem it necessary before taking steps with regard
                        to conclusion of a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic with all
                        ensuing consequences which were earlier mentioned more than once to exhaust
                        the possibilities to achieve a mutual agreement. We believe that in a
                        question so important as that of a German peace settlement not a single
                        unused opportunity should be left aside if, of course, all the interested
                        sides are guided by good intentions, if they strive not for an increase of
                        tension in Europe and in the whole world, not for encouragement of forces of
                        revanche and aggression, not for war, but for a relaxation of tension, for
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>The success of peaceful settlement in Laos gives all of us an encouraging
                        example. The President once expressed an idea that if a mutually acceptable
                        solution of the Laotian problem could be reached it would make easier for
                        the United States to find ways to peaceful settlement of the German problem.
                        We also believe that now it is the turn of the German problem.</p>
                    <p>In Laos we moved step by step and now it seems that we are close to a final
                        settlement. Our proposals that were set forth above also provide for
                        settlement of the problem of foreign troops in West Berlin during a <pb
                            n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0163"/>certain transitional period, by
                        several stages up to the complete withdrawal of those troops.</p>
                    <p>We want to draw the attention of the President that we are putting forward
                        our proposals on problems of a German peace settlement with due regard for
                        the considerations and position of the American side and we seriously count
                        on the possibility of an agreement. If the President reacts positively to
                        our new proposal, the Foreign Minister of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> could at a meeting with the Secretary of State in Geneva
                        come to a final agreement. Thus a meeting between the President of the US
                        and the Chairman of Council of Ministers of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> would be prepared, during which it would be possible to
                        fix an achieved understanding and, provided there is an agreement between
                        the parties, to sign appropriate documents.</p>
                    <p>The achievement of an agreement on the problems of a German peace settlement,
                        including the normalization of the situation in West Berlin would have a
                        profound impact on all the peoples as an example of effective cooperation
                        between the powers in the field of peace in accord-ance with the principles
                        of the United Nations. This would be a major victory for the policy both of
                        the Soviet Union and the United States and, we are sure, of all those who
                        stand for peace and condemn war. This would create a basis for a fruitful
                        cooperation of the two powers also in the solution of other more cardinal
                        problems relating to the main international problem of our time—that of
                        general and complete disarmament and developing on its basis peaceful
                        cooperation among all states and peoples.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, this would open a new chapter in the history of Soviet-American
                        relations in which undoubtedly are vitally interested not only the peoples
                        of our countries but also the peoples of the whole world. And the first
                        steps of our countries along a new road could be consolidated by a state
                        visit of the President of the United States to the Soviet Union who would be
                        a welcome guest of the peoples and the government of our country.</p>

                        since its contents related directly to the subject of their discussion, but
                        I should also like to take this opportunity to add my personal views. I
                        believe that in a matter of such seriousness and potential danger to peace,
                        we must take advantage of any legitimate channel in an effort to clarify our
                        respective positions.</p>
                    <p>As heads of government we are naturally interested in the welfare of our
                        peoples, but we also have a certain obligation to history and to humanity as
                        a whole. This dual responsibility demands that each of us make an effort to
                        understand the position of the other and to see whether accommodations
                        cannot be made, consistent with the basic interests of both parties,
                        directed toward finding peaceful solutions to outstanding differences. This
                        seems particularly important in the case of Germany and Berlin where the
                        vital interests of great nations are involved at a major point of
                        friction.</p>
                    <p>What we, therefore, find especially troubling in the present Soviet position
                        is the consistent failure, even in the very formulation of the problem, to
                        take any real account of what we have made clear are the vital interests of
                        the United States and its Allies. For example, the Soviet Government has on
                        a number of occasions, as in your most recent communication, complained that
                        it has put forward a number of concrete proposals which take into account
                        “the official position and motives of prestige of the United States,” but
                        that “unfortunately, no proposal has been put forward by the American side
                        which would enhance the possibility of solving the question of drawing a
                        line through World War II by abolishing the occupation regime in West Berlin
                        and giving it the status of a free city.” Such a formulation is, in effect,
                        the very crux of the problem, because it states the issue in a way which
                        embodies all of the Soviet premises and none of the Western premises in its
                        evaluation of the current situation.</p>
                    <p>We have gone to some pains over the past year to define to you what we
                        consider to be our vital interests in the Berlin situation. These do not
                        take away anything from the Soviet Union which it now enjoys. On the
                        contrary, we have attempted to show that an arrangement mindful of these
                        interests could lead to a chain of developments of mutual benefit to both
                        sides. The Soviet Government, on the other hand, consistently states the
                        problem in terms which completely ignore our vital interests and proposes an
                        outcome under the shadow of a threatened fait accompli which the Western
                        Powers can either accept in advance or in the actual fact.</p>
                    <p>In your recent communication, you note that the “main outstanding question is
                        that of the withdrawal of the occupation troops of the United <pb n="144"
                            xml:id="pg_144" facs="0166"/>States, Great Britain and France from West
                        Berlin and of the abolition there of the occupation status.” To accept this
                        formulation would be to accept the Soviet position one hundred per cent. We
                        find it difficult to see even the slightest element of compromise here on
                        the part of the Soviet Government. The various formulae which the Soviet
                        Government has put forward all have the same objective—the total withdrawal
                        or a severe reduction in the position of Western forces in Berlin. Merely
                        mixing the same ingredients together in different proportions does not
                        change the basic fact that the result is impossible from our point of view.
                        We cannot, therefore, accept as accurate the statement that these formulae
                        attempt to take into account the “official position and motives of prestige
                        of the United States.” They run directly counter to them. Does the Soviet
                        Government really believe that our acceptance of any of them, including the
                        most recent, would not be interpreted throughout the world as a complete
                        capitulation? We know that it would be, not only by the West Berliners who
                        would immediately begin to abandon the city and leave it a hollow shell, but
                        by all governments and informed peoples. It was for this reason that, at our
                        meeting in Vienna now more than a year ago, we placed such stress on the
                        commitment of the United States to Berlin in terms of our national prestige
                        and vital interests. Nothing that has happened since then has affected the
                        meaning of our remarks.</p>
                    <p>The question of Western troop presence is central. Surface changes in the
                        Soviet position which do not really take account of this fact do not provide
                        a real basis for serious negotiations. Without this recognition of our vital
                        interests it is difficult to see how other aspects of the situation can
                        usefully be considered.</p>
                    <p>Having said this much about the Soviet position, I feel that I must also
                        comment on your description of our position. To say that the American side
                        has not put forward a proposal “which would enhance the possibility of
                        solving the question of drawing a line through World War II by abolishing
                        the occupation regime in West Berlin and by giving it the status of a free
                        city” is, as I have indicated, to state the problem without the most minimum
                        elements of reciprocity. We are not opposed to drawing a line through World
                        War II (though we believe it more important to avoid World War III), but
                        drawing such a line to us cannot mean accepting the position of one of the
                        victors of World War II at the complete expense of three of the other
                        victors. Our views as to how appropriately to draw a line through World War
                        II are well known. We understand that these views are unacceptable to the
                        Soviet Government. Because we know this we have not insisted on pressing our
                        views to the point of conflict and crisis, although we believe them to be
                        correct. We could not, of course, be expected to put forward proposals
                        eliminating ourselves from West Berlin.</p>
                    <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0167"/>
                    <p>We have instead tried to be practical in our approach and in the specific
                        proposals we have put forward. These have not proceeded from the assumption
                        that one side must be prepared to abandon its position entirely. We have
                        instead been motivated by the desire to eliminate the Berlin issue as a
                        source of major conflict, which it is in the interest of both sides to
                        avoid. We have attempted, therefore, to provide a means of dealing with the
                        fact of disagreement in such a way as to serve the broader common interest
                        of both sides in the avoidance of head-on collision and in the preservation
                        of peace. We have also made a number of suggestions for relaxing the sense
                        of crisis in the Berlin area.</p>
                    <p>You are, of course, familiar with the informal working paper which Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> gave Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at Geneva on March 22,
                            1962.<note n="3" xml:id="d51fn3">For text, see <ref
                                target="frus1961-63v15#pg_69">vol. XV, pp. 69</ref>-<ref
                                target="frus1961-63v15#pg_71">71</ref>.</note> We have never felt
                        that the merits of our suggested approach have really adequately been
                        considered by the Soviet Government or dealt with in subsequent discussions.
                        The language of this paper was not meant to be sacrosanct, but it reflected
                        a sincere effort to find points on which there seemed to be at least some
                        agreement in terms of previous statements made by both sides. We would,
                        therefore, hope that you would review the explanations which Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> has given to see whether our
                        approach does not suggest an acceptable way out of the present impasse.</p>
                    <p>In a recent speech, you pointed to the example of Laos as showing that, given
                        a desire for agreement, ways can be found to settle the most challenging and
                        complicated international problems. We can agree entirely with this. In the
                        case of Berlin, there is also undoubtedly a desire for agreement. What seems
                        to be lacking so far, however, is any common ground as to what might be
                        required in order to achieve agreement. Desire for agreement is important as
                        a necessary beginning, but it cannot suffice in itself unless a spirit of
                        patience and of respect for the vital interests of the other party is also
                        present. We feel confident that, if these factors are present, we will also
                        be able to work out something on Berlin which will contribute a resolution
                        satisfactory to both sides.</p>
                    <p>In your same speech you pointed out that the German question did not have a
                        direct bearing on disarmament but was closely related to it. Here again we
                        can agree. Even a quieting of the Berlin question on the basis of respect
                        for the mutual interests of both sides could not help but markedly improve
                        the entire atmosphere of relations between the Soviet Union and the United
                        States. As the two major nuclear powers, we have an overriding common
                        interest, deriving from our troubling knowledge of the destructive
                        potentialities of the new weapons, in preventing their spread into the
                        control of other countries. We are certain that one of the major factors in
                        recent years, not only in the general acceleration of arms <pb n="146"
                            xml:id="pg_146" facs="0168"/>preparations but also in focusing attention
                        on nuclear weapons, has been the almost continuous crisis over Berlin since
                        November, 1958. Further threats to Berlin and continued heightening of the
                        crisis can only lead to additional measures in this direction.</p>
                    <p>We feel, therefore, that we have an additional strong and common interest in
                        arriving at a solution of the Berlin problem, consistent with our mutual
                        interests and prestige, in order to relieve the continuing pressures for an
                        arms race including the piling up and diffusion of nuclear weapons. We might
                        add that the enlarged U.S. military preparations which began last summer
                        took place only after the renewal of Soviet threats against our position in
                        Berlin. Our efforts in the military field, and those of our Allies, were a
                        sign of the seriousness with which we all regard the defense of our vital
                        interests in Berlin. This military build-up, however, was not something we
                        wanted, or something which would have happened in the absence of the
                        developments of last summer. If it is true that the threats to our position
                        in Berlin remain a serious source of difference between our two countries,
                        it is just as obvious that some satisfactory arrangement on Berlin would
                        greatly improve the atmosphere and remove an important motive for increased
                        Western effort in the armaments field. This is a consideration to which we
                        hope you will give deep personal thought. Further pressures on Berlin can
                        only exacerbate the situation and enhance the danger of an arms race which
                        we assume neither of us basically desires.</p>
                    <p>We undoubtedly live in a climactic age. Science has now given man a capacity
                        for destruction which, for the first time, could threaten the very existence
                        of the race itself. This fact makes it imperative that, as rational men, we
                        attempt to resolve our differences rather than move step-by-step towards a
                        major confrontation. In reading the history of past wars and how they began,
                        we cannot help but be impressed how frequently the failure of communication,
                        misunderstanding and mutual irritation have played an important role in the
                        events leading up to fateful decisions for war. In the nuclear age, we
                        cannot be resigned to passive acceptance of a chain of causation which seems
                        to determine the course of history from the outset. We know from your own
                        willingness to discuss these matters that you do not hold to the view that
                        what is happening now is predetermined, and cannot be effected by the
                        decisions which our governments take. I write with this in mind, and urge
                        that you give serious thought to the reflections and suggestions which this
                        communication contains. I have not tried here to deal with every aspect of
                        your communication, but have limited our comment to what seems to be the
                        heart of the issue between us. We would not, however, want silence on these
                        other points to be interpreted as complete agreement on our part with your
                        formulation of the problems and suggested solutions.</p>

                    <p>If I may summarize, the following lines of approach have seemed to us to be
                        open in seeking a satisfactory resolution of the German and Berlin question: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>We might join in a real attempt to draw a line through World War
                                II by agreeing on a German settlement based on the freely expressed
                                wish of the German people. As you know, this is in our view the best
                                solution to the problems of Germany and Berlin. We have not pressed

                            <item>We might deal with the present situation as a factual matter,
                                including the fact of the Western presence in West Berlin. This
                                could mean proceeding on the basis of our informal working paper of
                                March 22, 1962. It would essentially reflect a recognition that
                                there are basic elements in the Berlin situation on which there
                                cannot now be agreement. With such recognition, steps might be taken
                                to ease tensions in the immediate area of Berlin, and it might
                                perhaps be less difficult thereafter to deal with other aspects of
                                the Berlin question while moving ahead with the reduction of
                                tensions in other fields. We have in mind here particularly steps
                                toward disarmament.</item>

                    <p>It is now expected that our Foreign Ministers will be meeting shortly in
                        Geneva to sign an agreement on Laos. They will undoubtedly find the occasion
                        to discuss further the question of Berlin. We hope that Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will come to Geneva with
                        a position embodying genuine elements of reciprocity and taking account of
                        our vital interests in the Berlin situation. If this should prove to be the
                        case, we feel certain that much progress can be made in removing a major
                        source of contention—an accomplishment which would surely have a remarkable
                        and heartening effect in improving the atmosphere and making possible
                        progress in other related areas.</p>

                        proposals on the cessation of nuclear tests.</p>
                    <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0171"/>
                    <p>Now I would like to address myself to you to find out whether we can reach at
                        last a practical agreement on this important problem even though it may not
                        solve the whole problem completely.</p>
                    <p>The positions of our sides on the question of cessation of nuclear tests are
                        well known. We believe that it would be in the interests of peace to put an
                        end to all nuclear tests with an appropriate control by the national means
                        of states to be established. You still express doubts with regard to this
                        position of ours. At the same time you appeal to us to accept your proposals
                        on the cessation of nuclear tests in all environments on such conditions
                        which in our deep conviction do not have any justification and are
                        absolutely unacceptable to us for the reasons to which we have pointed out
                        more than once. I think you yourself understand that too. Perhaps that is
                        why the Anglo-American proposals contain also an alternative version. You
                        propose to conclude an agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests in the
                        atmosphere, in outer space and under water and leave aside underground
                        tests.</p>
                    <p>We are ready to take into account your position. Let us immediately sign an
                        agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests in the atmosphere, outer space
                        and under water but at the same time let us agree that with regard to
                        underground tests negotiations will go on with an aim to reach an agreement
                        on the underground tests as well. However we are of the opinion that the
                        peoples would be extremely disappointed if the underground tests continue
                        even at the time when negotiations are in progress on the possibility of an
                        agreement on this problem. We believe that the governments of nuclear powers
                        would act with honor if they agreed, and fixed that in the agreement as
                        well, that the negotiations on the cessation of underground nuclear tests
                        must go on and that during those negotiations and henceforth until an
                        agreement banning also underground nuclear tests is reached, nuclear powers
                        shall refrain from conducting such tests.</p>
                    <p>We think that an agreement on such basis, though in our opinion it is not
                        satisfactory in every respect, would, nevertheless, be a major step
                        forward.</p>
                    <p>I will tell you frankly that [in] accepting such an agreement we make a step
                        to meet your position which we cannot justify since we are convinced that
                        there is every possibility to conclude already now a comprehensive agreement
                        on the cessation of all nuclear tests, but which we are ready to take into
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>You may say that there is not much new in what I have said. May be. But we
                        are convinced that such a solution and such an agreement do not give either
                        us or you any unilateral advantage, but benefits arising out of them for all
                        nuclear powers and for the cause of peace in general are obvious.</p>
                    <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0172"/>
                    <p>And, finally, the last consideration: it is not clear from your and
                            Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName>’s statement what
                        role France as nuclear power shall play. We proceeded earlier and proceed
                        now from an assumption that under any international agreement on the
                        cessation of nuclear weapons tests France should assume commitments
                        analogous to those of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the US and
                        Britain.</p>
                    <p>I await with great interest your reaction to the considerations I have
                        expressed. If you react to them positively then our representatives could,
                        evidently without great difficulty, work out the text of an appropriate
                        international treaty.</p>

                                target="#d53">Document 53</ref>.</note> Now that the subcommittee on
                        nuclear test ban is continuing in session throughout the recess in the
                        18-Nation Disarmament Conference, I think we should make a serious effort to
                        work out such an agreement in time to meet the target date of January 1,
                        1963, which both sides have mentioned in the Geneva negotiations. We have
                        prepared such a treaty, <note n="2" xml:id="d55fn2">Reference is to ENDC/59,
                            submitted to the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee on August 27; for

                            II, pp. 804-807.</note> and our representatives and those of the United
                        Kingdom will be working with yours in the subcommittee to get the earliest
                        possible agreement on a final text.</p>
                    <p>While we are negotiating toward a limited ban of this type we should at the
                        same time be negotiating towards a treaty for banning nuclear weapons tests
                        in all environments. As part of this effort we could be working to eliminate
                        the difference of view as to a question of scientific fact which has so far
                        kept our negotiators apart. Our scientists advise me that although
                        substantial progress has been made in detecting and identifying nuclear
                        explosions on the basis of instrumentation, it is not possible to do so on a
                        basis which renders the requirement of on-site inspections unnecessary. Your
                        delegation has taken the opposing view but has not supplied any scientific
                        information which may have led your government to hold this view. A joint
                        working party of your scientists together with ours and scientists from the
                        United Kingdom might be able, finally, to dispel the differences which have
                        so far blocked our efforts to obtain agreement.</p>
                    <p>I believe that when we have prepared and put into effect a treaty banning
                        tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water, we can then look at
                        the problem of continued testing under ground and take such steps as we may
                        then determine seem most likely to be helpful in arriving at a comprehensive
                        treaty in the light of the progress which has been made at that time.</p>
                    <p>In your message you mention the role that France should play in the treaty.
                        Of course, our comprehensive treaty draft provides that the United States,
                        the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union shall cooperate <pb n="152"
                            xml:id="pg_152" facs="0174"/>in encouraging other states to become
                        parties to the treaty. For its part, the United States would work in close
                        consultation with France and would hope that France would adhere to the
                        treaty. Indeed, both you and we have a great interest in assuring the
                        adherence to the treaty of all states or authorities capable of conducting a
                        nuclear weapons test. Without their adherence the treaty could not
                        endure.</p>
                    <p>A test ban agreement, together with an agreement on the nondissemination of

                        powerful effect in deterring the spread of nuclear weapons capabilities to
                        other countries. I firmly believe that obtaining this objective is in our
                        mutual interest. It cannot be in the security interest of any of us if the
                        present small number of nuclear powers is expanded, for, to the extent this
                        is the case, the possibilities of war by accident or by design can only
                        increase. There is still time to put an effective end to this threat.<note

                    <p>I studied with interest your reply to my considerations forwarded through
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on the question
                        of cessation of nuclear weapon tests.<note n="1" xml:id="d56fn1"><ref
                                target="#d55">Documents 55</ref> and <ref target="#d53"

                    <p>It is said in your reply that a serious effort should be made to work out by
                        January 1, 1963 an agreement on the question of cessation of nuclear weapon
                        tests. Well, I can say quite definitely that we will not make you wait. The
                        Soviet Union in the course of many years has been pressing for concluding an
                        agreement on cessation of all nuclear weapon tests and we are prepared to
                        make new efforts in this direction for the sake of achieving this aim.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government is convinced that national means of detecting nuclear
                        explosions now at the disposal of the states are quite adequate to ensure
                        strict control over the fulfillment by all states of their commitments with
                        regard to cessation of nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer
                        space and under water as well as underground. And the U.S. too recognizes
                        this now with respect to three types of tests—in the atmosphere, in outer
                        space and under water—and no longer insists on establishing international
                        control over the cessation of these tests. Thus there seems to be no
                        difference between us on this point any longer. There remains the question
                        of underground tests. In the U.S. doubts are still being expressed as to the
                        adequacy of national means for detecting underground tests. We do not have
                        such doubts. Nevertheless <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0175"/>we are
                        prepared to use every opportunity to come to an agreement on this question
                        on a mutually acceptable basis, on such a basis that would remove your
                        doubts.</p>
                    <p>I do not know whether you have noticed a suggestion of British scientists
                        Bullard and Penney put forward at the recent Pugwash conference of
                        scientists <note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2">Reference is to Sir Edward Bullard
                            and Sir William Penney and the 10th Pugwash Conference on Science and
                            World Affairs held in London September 3-7.</note> concerning the use of
                        automatic seismic stations working without any personnel. As we understood,
                        the idea of this suggestion is that automatic seismic stations help with
                        their records to determine what is the cause of this or that underground
                        tremor—underground nuclear blasts or ordinary earthquakes. It would be a
                        sort of mechanical control without men. After thinking this suggestion over
                        we came to the conclusion that it can be accepted if this would make it
                        easier to reach an agreement. In this case it could be provided in the
                        treaty banning all nuclear weapon tests that automatic seismic stations be
                        set up both near the borders of the nuclear states and 2-3 such stations
                        directly on the territory of the states possessing nuclear weapons—in the
                        areas most frequently subjected to earthquakes.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government agrees to this only because it seeks a mutually
                        acceptable basis for an agreement. We do not intend to violate the
                        commitment that we assume regarding cessation of tests but we also want to
                        make you and the public opinion of the U.S. to feel confident that all sides
                        will display an honest approach in fulfilling this commitment.</p>
                    <p>If you agree to this then we could without much difficulty come to an
                        agreement on cessation of all nuclear weapon tests.</p>
                    <p>I would like to view as an encouraging sign the fact that the American
                        scientists who took part in the Pugwash conference—and as I was told, very
                        prominent ones—approved of the suggestion about the use of <pb n="154"
                            xml:id="pg_154" facs="0176"/>automatic seismic stations for the purposes
                        of control. The Soviet scientists—participants in the Pugwash
                        conference—also approved of this suggestion. So it appears that the
                        scientists are already in agreement. Then there is a possibility to move
                        ahead quickly. And as for us, we would like very much to put an end to all
                        that and reach, at last, an agreement on cessation of nuclear tests of all
                        kinds. There have been enough—both for us and for you—of experimental blasts
                        carried out in the atmosphere and underground.</p>
                    <p>If we can come now to the conclusion of an agreement on cessation of all
                        nuclear weapon tests we will make good for the peoples of our countries and
                        for the peoples of the entire world.</p>
                    <p>We prefer to conclude now a treaty on cessation of all nuclear weapon tests.
                        But if the Western powers are not yet prepared for that even taking into
                        account the suggestions put forward at the Pugwash conference we, as I have
                        already told you, are ready in this case also to make a step toward the
                        Western powers and to conclude at this time a treaty on cessation of nuclear
                        weapon tests in three environments: in the atmosphere, in outer space and
                        under water.</p>
                    <p>It would be incorrect in doing that to leave open the question of underground
                        nuclear tests. For it would create a false impression with the world public
                        opinion, a kind of illusion, that an agreement on cessation of tests has
                        seemingly been concluded and that the competition among states in perfecting
                        nuclear arms in coming to an end whereas in fact this competition would
                        continue. The weapons already created would be remodeled on the basis of new
                        scientific data obtained as a result of experimental underground blasts,
                        that is the states would replenish their arsenals with ever more perfect,
                        ever more destructive types of nuclear weapons. With that we cannot agree. I
                        must say frankly and openly that it is impossible to agree to conclude an
                        agreement on the basis of tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under
                        water if the United States intends to continue underground nuclear
                        explosions. Since in this case we too would face a necessity to carry out
                        experimental nuclear weapon tests and we would conduct those tests, as we
                        are doing now, in the atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>What is the way out? From our previous exchange of opinion you know how we
                        propose to overcome this difficulty—to agree that after a treaty banning
                        nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water is signed,
                        negotiations on cessation of underground tests as well should be continued
                        and while these suggestions are in progress and until the agreement is
                        reached all nuclear powers should refrain from conducting such tests.</p>
                    <p>But some people in the West do not want even to hear about any commitment by
                        the states to refrain from conducting nuclear tests. And on the part of some
                        statesmen and in the American press assertions are <pb n="155"
                            xml:id="pg_155" facs="0177"/>made from time to time that the Soviet
                        Union has allegedly violated some agreement on moratorium on nuclear tests.
                        However those who make such statements have neither proof nor ground to
                        support them.</p>
                    <p>And what are the facts? No international agreement on moratorium on
                        underground or any other nuclear tests ever existed and nobody ever signed
                        such an agreement. It can be reminded that as early as March 31, 1958 the
                        Soviet Union unilaterally discontinued tests of all kinds of atomic and
                        hydrogen weapons and called upon the Western powers to follow its example.
                        But the U.S. and Britain responded then to that proposal of ours with an
                        unprecedented in scope new series of tests of nuclear bombs. In subsequent
                        period since the end of 1958 neither the United States or Britain nor the
                        Soviet Union conducted nuclear weapon tests, but they acted so not because
                        of any obligations coming from an international agreement but because of
                        their own unilateral decisions. However, as early as December 29, 1959 your
                        predecessor President Eisenhower clearly and definitely stated that the U.S.
                        did not consider itself any longer bound by its statement that it had no
                        intention to conduct nuclear tests. As for France—a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> ally of the U.S. and Britain—it was even at that time
                        conducting one nuclear explosion after another.</p>
                    <p>All this is perfectly known and he who nevertheless claims that the Soviet
                        Union allegedly violated some moratorium on nuclear tests either has a short
                        memory or simply seeks to torpedo the conclusion of an agreement on
                        cessation of nuclear weapon tests.</p>
                    <p>I would like to note with satisfaction that now you seem to agree in
                        principle that along with the conclusion of a treaty on the ban of nuclear
                        weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water a moratorium
                        with regard to underground explosions be accepted. If this is so, then it
                        opens certain prospects.</p>
                    <p>You believe at the same time, as I have understood, that there should be no
                        unlimited moratorium on underground tests. But we do not put the question
                        that way. We do not propose to declare an unlimited moratorium on
                        underground explosions. We suggest to declare such moratorium for a certain
                        period of time, while the negotiations on banning underground tests of
                        nuclear weapons are in progress. For how long those negotiations will go
                        on—it is of course, impossible to say. But we do not think that much time is
                        needed to conclude a final agreement on underground tests, provided, of
                        course, that both sides display interest in reaching such an agreement
                        promptly.</p>
                    <p>Anyway we are ready to agree on a term for the course of which the states
                        will assume commitments not to conduct underground nuclear explosions, if an
                        agreement banning nuclear tests only in the atmosphere, in outer space and
                        under water is reached. We agree, for instance, on a 5-year term. And during
                        the five years it will certainly be possible to agree on a final solution of
                        the question of banning also underground nuclear <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156"
                            facs="0178"/>explosions though, I repeat, I am convinced that it could
                        be done much faster, especially if the idea of use for the purposes of
                        control of automatic seismic stations is acceptable to you. During this
                        period of time, one should assume, all American scientists too will get
                        convinced that the national means of detection of nuclear explosions are
                        quite adequate for assuring a foolproof control over cessation of nuclear
                        tests, underground tests included.</p>
                    <p>If, however, even during that term an agreement is not reached—what to do in
                        this case? Then the whole question of banning nuclear weapon tests will have
                        to be reconsidered anew. And if the American side then insists on renewing
                        underground nuclear tests, then—I want to say this already now and in plain
                        terms—the Soviet Union will consider itself free from assumed obligations
                        not to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under
                        water.</p>
                    <p>These are considerations which came to my mind in connection with your reply
                        on the question of cessation of nuclear weapon tests. Giving you these
                        considerations I think of nothing else but how to move from the dead point,
                        and out of deadlock, the question of cessation of nuclear weapon tests.</p>
                    <p>If you being concerned about the same are in agreement with our
                        considerations let me know and then the Soviet representatives in Geneva
                        will at once be given instructions to get down together with your and
                        British representatives to practical work of preparing a draft
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>One cannot doubt that an agreement on cessation of nuclear weapon tests would
                        be greeted with tremendous joy by all mankind. The peoples wherever they
                        live—in Europe or America, in Africa, Asia or Australia—desire peace, a
                        lasting peace, they want an end to the nuclear arms race, they want the
                        threat of nuclear war be eliminated.</p>
                    <p>During his meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Dobrynin
                            Robert Kennedy</persName> referring to you, Mr. President,
                        confidentially touched upon the problem of Soviet-American relations. He
                        said in particular that you are concerned with the worsening of these
                        relations. We ourselves are very much upset about that but we would like to
                        draw your attention to the fact that the aggravation of relations between
                        the Soviet Union and the United States was not sown by us and it was not we
                        who started it. We have sincerely sought and continue to seek to do
                        everything for the normalization of our relations and not only for
                        normalization but for their radical betterment. But that is being hindered
                        by the hot-beds of international tension which are a source of constant
                        friction between our countries. They should be removed and, first of all,
                        the abnormal situation in West Berlin should be done away with.</p>
                    <p>I believe that you, Mr. President, like me realize that until a reasonable
                        solution is reached on West Berlin this source will always make our <pb
                            n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0179"/>relations feverish. And under
                        present circumstances we do not see any other way out but to sign a German
                        peace treaty. On this basis it would be possible with no loss to the
                        prestige of either side to solve the problem of West Berlin too, to
                        guarantee, as you say, the freedom of the population of West Berlin by
                        stationing there for some not very long time a certain number of symbolic
                        troops under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> flag. It would seem, what
                        can be more reasonable, if there is a desire to actually reach an agreement
                        and eliminate the hot-beds that from time to time make our relations
                        feverish and sometimes bring them to the red-hot glow.</p>
                    <p>If there is somebody who is interested in preserving those hot-beds then such
                        interest stems from nothing else but a desire to prevent by all means the
                        normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the U.S. And I say
                        straightforwardly that it is, of course, Adenauer who is interested in that
                        in the first place. By no means he is motivated by good intentions. The
                        Hitlerite Germany lost the war with all the ensuing consequences. Its plans
                        to expand “Lebensraum” at the expense of other states ended in failure. This
                        should be recognized once and for all. In fact, that is what the United
                        States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and other countries fought for
                        against the Hitlerite Germany. Why then should you and we now reckon with
                        the revanchist strivings of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and even
                        encourage them delaying indefinitely the conclusion of a German peace treaty
                        and preserving the present indefinite situation, fraught with danger? After
                        all it is the absence of a peace treaty that feeds the hopes of aggressive
                        revanchist circles in West Germany for a possibility to revise the results
                        of World War II.</p>
                    <p>Now in all countries there are more and more people who think of and are
                        concerned with the destinies of the world and who seek not to let it
                        escalate to war. They more and more clearly understand that it is impossible
                        to postpone any further the conclusion of a German peace treaty and to
                        preserve the present dangerous situation.</p>
                    <p>During my conversations on all those questions with your Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> I told him that we are ready to
                        take into consideration the circumstances that you are finding yourself in
                        in connection with preparation for congressional elections. Such, evidently,
                        are “traditions” in the United States that in the course of election
                        struggle they forget, carried away by passions, about common sense and begin
                        playing with fire, competing in saying more and louder absurd things that
                        sow danger of world war. In order not to play in such conditions a role of
                        some third force breaking from outside into this struggle between the
                        competing parties we decided to put the German problem, so to say, on ice
                        until the end of the elections. We had in mind that after elections we would
                        resume the dialogue. We were under the impression that we would meet an
                        understanding on the part of the American side, all the more that on many
                        questions relating to German peace settlement a certain rapprochement <pb
                            n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0180"/>of our positions has already been
                        achieved that gives hope for a possibility of an agreement.</p>
                    <p>The only question on which the difference between us still remains is, as we
                        believe, that of the presence of foreign troops in West Berlin. And even not
                        the question of the presence of troops as such because on that we have
                        already made a step in your direction, but only the question—the troops of
                        what countries will be stationed there. You insist that the occupation
                        troops of the U.S., Britain and France continue to stay in West Berlin. But
                        that would not normalize the situation even after the signing of a peace
                        treaty because the main source of friction between our countries—the use of
                        West Berlin under the cover of occupation regime as a <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base—would remain unremoved. That is why
                        we considered and continue to consider that the best thing under the
                        circumstances would be to station in West Berlin the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> troops. To stabilize the situation in Europe it would be
                        also reasonable to have both German states—the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>—admitted to the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, so that they normalize at last
                        relations between each other and with other states—members of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Such is our position. I stated it in detail to Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> who, evidently, informed you
                        about it.</p>
                    <p>Recently I had a talk with your Secretary of the Interior Mr.<persName
                            corresp="#p_USL1">S. Udall</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d56fn3"
                            >Reported in telegram 616 from Moscow, September 7; for text, see <ref
                                target="frus1961-63v05">volume V</ref>.</note> He made a good
                        impression on me. Our conversation was friendly. And I never expected that
                        at the time I talked with him you would take a decision to request from the
                        Congress an authority to call up 150.000 reservists. Motivating that step of
                        yours you referred to the red-hot state of international atmosphere and to a
                        necessity for you in that connection to react promptly to the dangers that
                        may arise in any part of “the free world”. Everybody understands that when
                        the President of the U.S. demands an increase in armed forces and explains
                        that demand by an aggravation of the situation, it means that he considers
                        that the situation is aggravated by the other side, that is by us, the
                        Soviet Union. But we haven’t done anything that could give a pretext for
                        that. We did not carry out any mobilization, and did not make any
                        threats.</p>
                    <p>I must tell you straightforwardly, Mr. President, that your statement with
                        threats against Cuba is just an inconceivable step. Under present
                        circumstances, when there exist thermonuclear weapons, your request to the
                        Congress for an authority to call up 150.000 reservists is not only a step
                        making the atmosphere red-hot, it is already a dangerous sign that you want
                        to pour oil in the flame, to extinguish that red-hot glow by mobilizing new
                        military contingents. And that, naturally, forces the other side to respond
                        in kind. What could it lead to, all the more that you consider that the U.S.
                        has the right to attack Cuba whenever it wishes? But <pb n="159"
                            xml:id="pg_159" facs="0181"/>nowadays is not the Middle Ages, though
                        even at the time it was considered brigandage, and measures were taken
                        against such actions. And in our time such actions are absolutely
                        unthinkable. That is what made us to come out with the <gloss
                            target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> statement and later at the session of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly to qualify your act,
                        to remind of the norms of international law and to say about West
                        Berlin.</p>
                    <p>If there were no statement by you on Cuba, we, naturally, as Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> and Mr.<persName
                            corresp="#p_USL1">Udall</persName> were told, would not say anything on
                        West Berlin. Your statement forced us to do so.</p>
                    <p>We regret that this dangerous line is being continued in the United States
                        now. What is going on, for example, in the U.S. Congress? How can one, for
                        example, fail to notice the decision of the House of Representatives to stop
                        giving U.S. aid to any country that trades with Cuba or whose ships are used
                        for trading with Cuba. Isn’t that an act of an unpermissible arbitrariness
                        against freedom of international trade, an act of crude interference into
                        domestic affairs of other countries?</p>
                    <p>Very serious consequences may have the resolution adopted by the U.S. Senate
                        on the Cuban question. The contents of that resolution gives ground to draw
                        a conclusion that the U.S. is evidently ready to assume responsibility for
                        unleashing thermonuclear war. We consider that if what is written in that
                        resolution were actually carried out it would mean the beginning of war
                        because no country can agree with such interpretation of rights, with such
                        arbitrariness. Then there would be no U.N., everything would collapse and
                        roll into abyss as it happened once when the League of Nations collapsed.
                        Who wrecked it then? Japan and Hitler, who quit the League of Nations to
                        untie their hands and start war. And they did start it. Could it be that the
                        US wants to embark on such road?</p>
                    <p>We would greatly regret if it were so. We still do not lose hope that we will
                        be able to normalize our relations. But this can be achieved only when the
                        United States and its allies will strictly adhere to the generally
                        recognized norms of international law and will not interfere into the
                        domestic affairs of other states, will not threaten other countries. This is
                        the main thing. And this is the coexistence of which we spoke more than
                        once. You spoke of it too. But what kind of coexistence is this if the
                        United States would attack countries whose government or socio-political
                        system are not to its liking? In our time the world has split into two
                        camps—capitalist and socialist: you have neighbours whom, as you say, you do
                        not like while we have neighbours whom we do not like, but they are your
                        friends and allies. How can one, especially under these circumstances,
                        consider it to be one’s right to attack another country merely because its
                        government and internal order are not to your liking? If we conduct such a
                        policy, where this will lead to—to world war.</p>
                    <p>The most reasonable and the only right policy in our time if we want to
                        ensure peace and to live in peace is the policy of coexistence. And
                        coexistence <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0182"/>is first of all
                        recognizing for every people the right to choose its socio-political system
                        and noninterference by states into internal affairs of others. This also
                        directly follows from the U.N. Charter—the Charter which was adopted by our
                        countries who, moreover, are the founding members of the U.N. To interfere
                        into the internal affairs of other states means to undermine the very
                        foundation on which the whole structure of the U.N. is based. One should not
                        wreck the international building which has been created for the task of
                        ensuring peace and peaceful coexistence.</p>
                    <p>On the state of Soviet-American relations I would also like to express some
                        other considerations.</p>
                    <p>I spoke, for instance, to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                            >Thompson</persName> of the buzzing of our ships by American planes. On
                        what grounds this buzzing of the ships sailing in international waters is
                        carried on? Moreover, U.S. Navy ships demand that our ship report to them
                        where they go and what cargo they carry. One U.S. Navy ship even attempted
                        to stop our vessel. I told then Mr.<persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                            >Thompson</persName> to convey to you, that we protest against this.
                        Soviet ships which follow on the course given to them by the Government have
                        instructions not to yield to any pirate demands in international waters and
                        to proceed on their course even if they are threatened with opening fire. I
                        said then and I repeat—let them try to stop and sink our ships—this will be
                        the beginning of war because we will answer in kind. We have enough of
                        submarines which can defend the honor of the motherland. Our state possesses
                        other means too. You also have similar means. Why then should such
                        provocations be staged, why should we threaten each other?</p>
                    <p>I was pleased to receive from you, Mr. President, your assurance that you had
                        given strict instructions not to allow buzzing of our ships. But whether you
                        know it or not the assurance you gave me is not being kept. Your planes even
                        now go on buzzing our ships. I can tell you: in August there were 140 cases
                        of such buzzing.</p>
                    <p>It has just become known that the Puerto-Rican but actually American
                        authorities detained a British ship and arrested the Soviet cargo aboard
                        that ship—sugar that we have bought in Cuba. If such arbitrariness is not
                        stopped, you yourself realize what it can lead to.</p>
                    <p>Another unpleasant incident took place in connection with which we had to
                        officially and publicly protest—an intrusion into our air space of a U-2
                        reconnaissance plane in the area of Sakhalia. You explained that it happened
                        by incident. We took this explanation with understanding. Now it is clear
                        that it did not happen by incident because a U-2 plane also appeared over
                        China. Whom does it belong to? They say—to <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName>. But what is <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName>?<persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> is an affiliate of the U.S.<persName
                            corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> could not purchase the
                        planes because he himself <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0183"/>is on the
                        payroll of the U.S. Therefore those were also the actions of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>Evidently, the same line appears in this case showing that the U.S. has taken
                        a dangerous course. This makes us apprehensive and we are now compelled to
                        take appropriate measures. We did not carry out mobilization and we do not
                        think of one but we have been compelled to order our armed forces to be in
                        peak combat readiness. You forced us to do that by your mobilization and by
                        other measures that you have taken recently.</p>
                    <p>It may be that all this is being done in connection with pre-election
                        situation in your country. But this is very dangerous. This already goes
                        beyond the limits of the situation within one country because such actions
                        make the international situation red-hot, create a dangerous situation which
                        cannot but cause deep anxiety on the part of the peoples of all countries
                        for the destinies of peace.</p>
                    <p>It is not pleasant for me, Mr. President, to tell you about it. It would be
                        better, of course, to talk about more pleasant things. But nothing can be
                        done—my position obliges me to give due appraisal of those actions which are
                        now being taken by the United States. We cannot close our eyes and pretend
                        that we do not notice it or do not understand it.</p>
                    <p>Therefore I would ask you to correctly understand our anxiety and not to do
                        anything that could further aggravate the atmosphere and even expose the
                        world. We on our part again say to you that we will do nothing with regard
                        to West Berlin until the elections in the U.S. After the elections,
                        apparently in the second half of November, it would be necessary in our
                        opinion to continue the dialogue. Of great importance for finding the ways
                        to solve both this problem and other pressing international problems are
                        personal contacts of statesmen on the highest level. I think that if we,
                        persons entrusted with great confidence and bearing enormous responsibility,
                        constantly feel this responsibility, we will have to come to the realization
                        of the necessity of reaching an agreement on West Berlin to eliminate this
                        dangerous hot-bed which spoils our relations all the time.<note n="4"

                    <p>I am giving careful consideration to your communication of September
                            28th,<note n="1" xml:id="d59fn1"><ref target="#d56">Document
                            56</ref>.</note> and I am glad that we can continue to use this channel
                        as a means of communicating privately and frankly.</p>
                    <p>I shall want to comment separately on other aspects of your letter, but
                        because of the imminent discussions in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        I want you to have my views promptly on the subject of nuclear testing. I
                        believe that we are nearer to agreement on this issue than on others, and I
                        believe that we should keep at it to see if we cannot promptly reach the
                        understanding which the world wants and needs.</p>
                    <p>With respect to this topic, I am encouraged by the areas in which we are in
                        accord and by your statement that the Soviet Union is prepared to make “new
                        efforts” in order to conclude an early agreement. Certainly it would seem we
                        are agreed in our approach to three types of tests—in the atmosphere, in
                        outer space and under water.</p>
                    <p>With respect to underground tests, I am inclined to agree with you that the
                        recent Pugwash conference of scientists brought forth some interesting
                        suggestions, particularly those of British scientists Bullard and Penney. I
                        must comment that we interpret those suggestions in somewhat different light
                        than your letter indicates you do. Nonetheless the suggestions certainly are
                        worthy of intensive development. The development of automatic unmanned
                        seismic mechanisms might very well, if properly worked out, facilitate
                        agreement on the means of actually detecting underground explosions—although
                        my scientists indicate that it would require much more than the two or three
                        such stations you mentioned as being located directly in the areas most
                        frequently subjected to earthquakes. Of course, these mechanical devices
                        would still have to be supplemented by a modest number of on-site
                        inspections—for scientists agree that the data gathered by these machines
                        would still leave doubt as to the cause of the explosion in a number of
                        cases. Surely, considering the great value for international relations and
                        the general security and tranquility of the world which the comprehensive
                        agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests would entail, we can agree on
                        the number of such inspections which would be necessary to identify the
                        nature or cause of these explosions. Once that is done, with the number of
                        unmanned stations worked out scientifically, and the method for
                        international coordination <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0186"
                        />established, we can conclude a treaty which will enable all peoples of the
                        world to rest easier.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, you suggest that the agreement we can more promptly reach on
                        the cessation of tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water be
                        accompanied by a five year moratorium on underground explosions. But surely
                        it will not take five years to reach agreement—if agreement is ever to be
                        reached—on banning underground tests, particularly in view of our mutual
                        interest in the role of automatic seismic stations for detecting explosions.
                        I would not feel justified in submitting to the Senate, moreover, a treaty
                        on tests in other environments which would be discarded if agreement was not
                        reached on testing under ground. It is nuclear explosions in the atmosphere,
                        in outer space and under water which increase the percentage of fall-out and
                        are the cause of grave concern to all peoples of the world. Such a treaty,
                        in short, would be in itself a great step forward, both for humanitarian and
                        political reasons.</p>
                    <p>So I continue to think that we are within striking distance of a treaty
                        banning nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water. I
                        believe we should try to work out such an agreement in time to meet the
                        target day of January 1, 1963, and I think also that in the meanwhile we
                        should be working intensively to make progress as rapidly as possible on the
                        remaining problem of testing under ground. I believe that our negotiators
                        should return to their labors in an intense effort to reach agreement on the
                        questions that still divide us, and I hope very much that they will be able
                        to make real and rapid progress in the meetings now scheduled to resume on
                        November 12th.</p>

                        the developments to which I refer, I want you to know immediately and
                        accurately the position of my Government in this matter.</p>
                    <p>In our discussions and exchanges on Berlin and other international questions,
                        the one thing that has most concerned me has been the possibility that your
                        Government would not correctly understand the will and determination of the
                        United States in any given situation, since I have not assumed that you or
                        any other sane man would, in this nuclear age, deliberately plunge the world
                        into war which it is crystal clear no country could win and which could only
                        result in catastrophic consequences to the whole world, including the
                        aggressor.</p>
                    <p>At our meeting in Vienna and subsequently, I expressed our readiness and
                        desire to find, through peaceful negotiation, a solution to any and all
                        problems that divide us. At the same time, I made clear that in view of the
                        objectives of the ideology to which you adhere, the United States could not
                        tolerate any action on your part which in a major way disturbed the existing
                        over-all balance of power in the world. I stated that an attempt to force
                        abandonment of our responsibilities and commitments in Berlin would
                        constitute such an action and that the United States would resist with all
                        the power at its command.</p>
                    <p>It was in order to avoid any incorrect assessment on the part of your
                        Government with respect to Cuba that I publicly stated that if certain
                        developments in Cuba took place, the United States would do whatever must be
                        done to protect its own security and that of its allies.</p>
                    <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0188"/>
                    <p>Moreover, the Congress adopted a resolution expressing its support of this
                        declared policy.<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">For text of this resolution,
                            October 3, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current
                                Documents</hi>, 1962, pp. 389-390.</note> Despite this, the rapid
                        development of long-range missile bases and other offensive weapons systems
                        in Cuba has proceeded. I must tell you that the United States is determined
                        that this threat to the security of this hemisphere be removed. At the same
                        time, I wish to point out that the action we are taking is the minimum
                        necessary to remove the threat to the security of the nations of this
                        hemisphere. The fact of this minimum response should not be taken as a
                        basis, however, for any misjudgment on your part.</p>
                    <p>I hope that your Government will refrain from any action which would widen or
                        deepen this already grave crisis and that we can agree to resume the path of
                        peaceful negotiations.</p>

                    <p>I have just received your letter, and have also acquainted myself with text
                        of your speech of October 22 regarding Cuba.<note n="2" xml:id="d61fn2"><ref

                    <p>I should say frankly that measures outlined in your statement represent a
                        serious threat to peace and security of peoples. United States has <pb
                            n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0189"/>openly taken path of gross
                        violation of Charter of United Nations, path of violation of international
                        norms of freedom of navigation on high seas, path of aggressive actions both
                        against Cuba and against Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Statement of Government of United States America cannot be eval-uated in any
                        other way than as naked interference in domestic affairs of Cuban Republic,
                        Soviet Union, and other states. Charter of United Nations and international
                        norms do not give right to any state whatsoever to establish in
                        international waters control of vessels bound for shores of Cuban
                        Republic.</p>
                    <p>It is self-understood that we also cannot recognize right of United States to
                        establish control over armaments essential to Republic of Cuba for
                        strengthening of its defensive capacity.</p>
                    <p>We confirm that armaments now on Cuba, regardless of classification to which
                        they belong, are destined exclusively for defensive purposes, in order to
                        secure Cuban Republic from attack of aggressor.</p>
                    <p>I hope that Government of United States will show prudence and renounce
                        actions pursued by you, which could lead to catastrophic consequences for

                        was the action of your Government in secretly furnishing offensive weapons
                        to Cuba. We will be discussing this matter in the Security Council. In the
                        meantime, I am concerned that we both show prudence and do nothing to allow
                        events to make the situation more difficult to control than it already
                        is.</p>
                    <p>I hope that you will issue immediately the necessary instructions to your
                        ships to observe the terms of the quarantine, the basis of which was
                        established by the vote of the Organization of American States this
                        afternoon, and which will go into effect at 1400 hours Greenwich time

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have received your letter of
                        October 23, <note n="1" xml:id="d63fn1">See <ref target="#d62">Document
                                62</ref>.</note> have studied it, and am answering you.</p>
                    <p>Just imagine, Mr. President, that we had presented you with the conditions of
                        an ultimatum which you have presented us by your action. How would you have
                        reacted to this? I think that you would have been indignant at such a step
                        on our part. And this would have been understandable to us.</p>
                    <p>In presenting us with these conditions, you, Mr. President, have flung a
                        challenge at us. Who asked you to do this? By what right did you do this?
                        Our ties with the Republic of Cuba, like our relations with other states,
                        regardless of what kind of states they may be, concern only the two
                        countries between which these relations exist. And if we now speak of the
                        quarantine to which your letter refers, a quarantine may be established,
                        according to accepted international practice, only by agreement of states
                        between themselves, and not by some third party. Quarantines exist, for
                        example, on agricultural goods and products. But in this case the question
                        is in no way one of quarantine, but rather of far more serious things, and
                        you yourself understand this.</p>
                    <p>You, Mr. President, are not declaring a quarantine, but rather are setting
                        forth an ultimatum and threatening that if we do not give in to your demands
                        you will use force. Consider what you are saying! And you want to persuade
                        me to agree to this! What would it mean to agree to these demands? It would
                        mean guiding oneself in one’s relations with other countries not by reason,
                        but by submitting to arbitrariness. You are no longer appealing to reason,
                        but wish to intimidate us.</p>
                    <p>No, Mr. President, I cannot agree to this, and I think that in your own heart
                        you recognize that I am correct. I am convinced that in my place you would
                        act the same way.</p>
                    <p>Reference to the decision of the Organization of American States cannot in
                        any way substantiate the demands now advanced by the United States. This
                        Organization has absolutely no authority or basis for adopting decisions
                        such as the one you speak of in your letter. Therefore, we do not recognize
                        these decisions. International law exists and universally recognized norms
                        of conduct exist. We firmly adhere to the principles <pb n="170"
                            xml:id="pg_170" facs="0192"/>of international law and observe strictly
                        the norms which regulate navigation on the high seas, in international
                        waters. We observe these norms and enjoy the rights recognized by all
                        states.</p>
                    <p>You wish to compel us to renounce the rights that every sovereign state
                        enjoys, you are trying to legislate in questions of international law, and
                        you are violating the universally accepted norms of that law. And you are
                        doing all this not only out of hatred for the Cuban people and its
                        government, but also because of considerations of the election campaign in
                        the United States. What morality, what law can justify such an approach by
                        the American Government to international affairs? No such morality or law
                        can be found, because the actions of the United States with regard to Cuba
                        constitute outright banditry or, if you like, the folly of degenerate
                        imperialism. Unfortunately, such folly can bring grave suffering to the
                        peoples of all countries, and to no lesser degree to the American people
                        themselves, since the United States has completely lost its former isolation
                        with the advent of modern types of armament.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, Mr. President, if you coolly weigh the situation which has
                        developed, not giving way to passions, you will understand that the Soviet
                        Union cannot fail to reject the arbitrary demands of the United States. When
                        you confront us with such conditions, try to put yourself in our place and
                        consider how the United States would react to these conditions. I do not
                        doubt that if someone attempted to dictate similar conditions to you—the
                        United States—you would reject such an attempt. And we also say—no.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government considers that the violation of the freedom to use
                        international waters and international air space is an act of aggression
                        which pushes mankind toward the abyss of a world nuclear-missile war.
                        Therefore, the Soviet Government cannot instruct the captains of Soviet
                        vessels bound for Cuba to observe the orders of American naval forces
                        blockading that Island. Our instructions to Soviet mariners are to observe
                        strictly the universally accepted norms of navigation in international
                        waters and not to retreat one step from them. And if the American side
                        violates these rules, it must realize what responsibility will rest upon it
                        in that case. Naturally we will not simply be bystanders with regard to
                        piratical acts by American ships on the high seas. We will then be forced on
                        our part to take the measures we consider necessary and adequate in order to
                        protect our rights. We have everything necessary to do so.</p>

                    <p>October 25, 1962</p>
                    <p>"Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I have received your letter of October 24, <note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2"><ref
                                target="#d63">Document 63</ref>.</note> and I regret very much that
                        you still do not appear to understand what it is that has moved us in this
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>The sequence of events is clear. In August there were reports of important
                        shipments of military equipment and technicians from the Soviet Union to
                        Cuba. In early September I indicated very plainly that the United States
                        would regard any shipment of offensive weapons as presenting the gravest
                        issues. After that time, this Government received the most explicit
                        assurances from your Government and its representatives, both publicly and
                        privately, that no offensive weapons were being sent to Cuba. If you will
                        review the statement issued by Tass in September, you will see how clearly
                        this assurance was given.</p>
                    <p>In reliance on these solemn assurances I urged restraint upon those in this
                        country who were urging action in this matter at that time. And then I
                        learned beyond doubt what you have not denied—namely, that all these public
                        assurances were false and that your military people had set out recently to
                        establish a set of missile bases in Cuba. I ask you to recognize clearly,
                        Mr. Chairman, that it was not I who issued the first challenge in this case,
                        and that in the light of this record these activities in Cuba required the
                        responses I have announced.</p>
                    <p>I repeat my regret that these events should cause a deterioration in our
                        relations. I hope that your Government will take the necessary action to
                        permit a restoration of the earlier situation.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I have received your letter of October 25.<note n="1" xml:id="d65fn1">See
                                <ref target="#d64">Document 64</ref>.</note> From your letter, I got
                        the feeling that you have some understanding of the situation which has
                        developed and (some) sense of responsibility. I value this.</p>
                    <p>Now we have already publicly exchanged our evaluations of the events around
                        Cuba and each of us has set forth his explanation and his understanding of
                        these events. Consequently, I would judge that, apparently, a continuation
                        of an exchange of opinions at such a distance, even in the form of secret
                        letters, will hardly add anything to that which one side has already said to
                        the other.</p>
                    <p>I think you will understand me correctly if you are really concerned about
                        the welfare of the world. Everyone needs peace: both capitalists, if they
                        have not lost their reason, and, still more, Communists, people who know how
                        to value not only their own lives but, more than anything, the lives of the
                        peoples. We, Communists, are against all wars between states in general and
                        have been defending the cause of peace since we came into the world. We have
                        always regarded war as a calamity, and not as a game nor as a means for the
                        attainment of definite goals, nor, all the more, as a goal in itself. Our
                        goals are clear, and the means to attain them is labor. War is our enemy and
                        a calamity for all the peoples.</p>
                    <p>It is thus that we, Soviet people, and, together with US, other peoples as
                        well, understand the questions of war and peace. I can, in any case, firmly
                        say this for the peoples of the Socialist countries, as well as for all
                        progressive people who want peace, happiness, and friendship among
                        peoples.</p>
                    <p>I see, Mr. President, that you too are not devoid of a sense of anxiety for
                        the fate of the world <note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">Garble in the source text.
                            It was subsequently corrected to read “not without an”.</note>
                        understanding, and of what war entails. What <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173"
                            facs="0195"/>would a war give you? You are threatening us with war. But
                        you well know that the very least which you would receive in reply would be
                        that you would experience the same consequences as those which you sent us.
                        And that must be clear to us, people invested with authority, trust, and
                        responsibility. We must not succumb to intoxication and petty passions,
                        regardless of whether elections are impending in this or that country, or
                        not impending. These are all transient things, but if indeed war should
                        break out, then it would not be in our power to stop it, for such is the
                        logic of war. I have participated in two wars and know that war ends when it
                        has rolled through cities and villages, everywhere sowing death and
                        destruction.</p>
                    <p>In the name of the Soviet Government and the Soviet people, I assure you that
                        your conclusions regarding offensive weapons on Cuba are groundless. It is
                        apparent from what you have written me that our conceptions are different on
                        this score, or rather, we have different estimates of these or those
                        military means. Indeed, in reality, the same forms of weapons can have
                        different interpretations.</p>
                    <p>You are a military man and, I hope, will understand me. Let us take for
                        example a simple cannon. What sort of means is this: offensive or defensive?
                        A cannon is a defensive means if it is set up to defend boundaries or a
                        fortified area. But if one concentrates artillery, and adds to it the
                        necessary number of troops, then the same cannons do become an offensive
                        means, because they prepare and clear the way for infantry to attack. The
                        same happens with missile-nuclear weapons as well, with any type of this
                        weapon.</p>
                    <p>You are mistaken if you think that any of our means on Cuba are offensive.
                        However, let us not quarrel now. It is apparent that I will not be able to
                        convince you of this. But I say to you: You, Mr. President, are a military
                        man and should understand: Can one attack, if one has on one’s territory
                        even an enormous quantity of missiles of various effective radiuses and
                        various power, but using only these means. These missiles are a means of
                        extermination and destruction. But one cannot attack with these missiles,
                        even nuclear missiles of a power of 100 megatons because only people,
                        troops, can attack. Without people, any means however powerful cannot be
                        offensive.</p>
                    <p>How can one, consequently, give such a completely incorrect interpretation as
                        you are now giving, to the effect that some sort of means on Cuba are
                        offensive. All the means located there, and I assure you of this, have a
                        defensive character, are on Cuba solely for the purposes of defense, and we
                        have sent them to Cuba at the request of the Cuban Government. You, however,
                        say that these are offensive means.</p>
                    <p>But, Mr. President, do you really seriously think that Cuba can attack the
                        United States and that even we together with Cuba can attack you from the
                        territory of Cuba? Can you really think that way? How is it <pb n="174"
                            xml:id="pg_174" facs="0196"/>possible? We do not understand this. Has
                        something so new appeared in military strategy that one can think that it is
                        possible to attack thus. I say precisely attack, and not destroy, since
                        barbarians, people who have lost their sense, destroy.</p>
                    <p>I believe that you have no basis to think this way. You can regard us with
                        distrust, but, in any case, you can be calm in this regard, that we are of
                        sound mind and understand perfectly well that if we attack you, you will
                        respond the same way. But you too will receive the same that you hurl
                        against us. And I think that you also understand this. My conversation with
                        you in Vienna gives me the right to talk to you this way.</p>
                    <p>This indicates that we are normal people, that we correctly understand and
                        correctly evaluate the situation. Consequently, how can we permit the
                        incorrect actions which you ascribe to us? Only lunatics or suicides, who
                        themselves want to perish and to destroy the whole world before they die,
                        could do this. We, however, want to live and do not at all want to destroy
                        your country. We want something quite different: To compete with your
                        country on a peaceful basis. We quarrel with you, we have differences on
                        ideological questions. But our view of the world consists in this, that
                        ideological questions, as well as economic problems, should be solved not by
                        military means, they must be solved on the basis of peaceful competition,
                        i.e., as this is understood in capitalist society, on the basis of
                        competition. We have proceeded and are proceeding from the fact that the
                        peaceful co-existence of the two different social-political systems, now
                        existing in the world, is necessary, that it is necessary to assure a stable
                        peace. That is the sort of principle we hold.</p>
                    <p>You have now proclaimed piratical measures, which were employed in the Middle
                        Ages, when ships proceeding in international waters were attacked, and you
                        have called this “a quarantine” around Cuba. Our vessels, apparently, will
                        soon enter the zone which your Navy is patrolling. I assure you that these
                        vessels, now bound for Cuba, are carrying the most innocent peaceful
                        cargoes. Do you really think that we only occupy ourselves with the carriage
                        of so-called offensive weapons, atomic and hydrogen bombs? Although perhaps
                        your military people imagine that these (cargoes) are some sort of special
                        type of weapon, I assure you that they are the most ordinary peaceful
                        products.</p>
                    <p>Consequently, Mr. President, let us show good sense. I assure you that on
                        those ships, which are bound for Cuba, there are no weapons at all. The
                        weapons which were necessary for the defense of Cuba are already there. I do
                        not want to say that there were not any shipments of weapons at all. No,
                        there were such shipments. But now Cuba has already received the necessary
                        means of defense.</p>
                    <p>I don’t know whether you can understand me and believe me. But I should like
                        to have you believe in yourself and to agree that one cannot give way to
                        passions; it is necessary to control them. And in what direction <pb n="175"
                            xml:id="pg_175" facs="0197"/>are events now developing? If you stop the
                        vessels, then, as you yourself know, that would be piracy. If we started to
                        do that with regard to your ships, then you would also be as indignant as we
                        and the whole world now are. One cannot give another interpretation to such
                        actions, because one cannot legalize lawlessness. If this were permitted,
                        then there would be no peace, there would also be no peaceful coexistence.
                        We should then be forced to put into effect the necessary measures of a
                        defensive character to protect our interests in accordance with
                        international law. Why should this be done? To what would all this lead?</p>
                    <p>Let us normalize relations. We have received an appeal from the Acting
                        Secretary General of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,U Thant, with his
                        proposals. I have already answered him. His proposals come to this, that our
                        side should not transport armaments of any kind to Cuba during a certain
                        period of time, while negotiations are being conducted—and we are ready to
                        enter such negotiations—and the other side should not undertake any sort of
                        piratical actions against vessels engaged in navigation on the high seas. I
                        consider these proposals reasonable. This would be a way out of the
                        situation which has been created, which would give the peoples the
                        possibility of breathing calmly. You have asked what happened, what evoked
                        the delivery of weapons to Cuba? You have spoken about this to our Minister
                        of Foreign Affairs. I will tell you frankly, Mr. President, what evoked
                        it.</p>
                    <p>We were very grieved by the fact—I spoke about it in Vienna—that a landing
                        took place, that an attack on Cuba was committed, as a result of which many
                        Cubans perished. You yourself told me then that this had been a mistake. I
                        respected that explanation. You repeated it to me several times, pointing
                        out that not everybody occupying a high position would acknowledge his
                        mistakes as you had done. I value such frankness. For my part, I told you
                        that we too possess no less courage; we also acknowledged those mistakes
                        which had been committed during the history of our state, and not only
                        acknowledged, but sharply condemned them.</p>
                    <p>If you are really concerned about the peace and welfare of your people, and
                        this is your responsibility as President, then I, as the Chairman of the
                        Council of Ministers, am concerned for my people. Moreover, the preservation
                        of world peace should be our joint concern, since if, under contemporary
                        conditions, war should break out, it would be a war not only between the
                        reciprocal claims, but a world wide cruel and destructive war.</p>
                    <p>Why have we proceeded to assist Cuba with military and economic aid? The
                        answer is: We have proceeded to do so only for reasons of humanitarianism.
                        At one time, our people itself had a revolution, when Russia was still a
                        backward country. We were attacked then. We were the target of attack by
                        many countries. The <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> participated in that
                        adventure. <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0198"/>This has been recorded
                        by participants in the aggression against our country. A whole book has been
                        written about this by General Graves, who, at that time, commanded the US
                        Expeditionary Corps. Graves called it “The American Adventure in
                        Siberia.”</p>
                    <p>We know how difficult it is to accomplish a revolution and how difficult it
                        is to reconstruct a country on new foundations. We sincerely sympathize with
                        Cuba and the Cuban people, but we are not interfering in questions of
                        domestic structure, we are not interfering in their affairs. The Soviet
                        Union desires to help the Cubans build their life as they themselves wish
                        and that others should not hinder them.</p>
                    <p>You once said that the United States was not preparing an invasion. But you
                        also declared that you sympathized with the Cuban counter-revolutionary
                        emigrants, that you support them and would help them to realize their plans
                        against the present Government of Cuba. It is also not a secret to anyone
                        that the threat of armed attack, aggression, has constantly hung, and
                        continues to hang over Cuba. It was only this which impelled us to respond
                        to the request of the Cuban Government to furnish it aid for the
                        strengthening of the defensive capacity of this country.</p>
                    <p>If assurances were given by the President and the Government of the United
                        States that the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> itself would not
                        participate in an attack on Cuba and would restrain others from actions of
                        this sort, if you would recall your fleet, this would immediately change
                        everything. I am not speaking for <persName corresp="#p_CRF1">Fidel
                            Castro</persName>, but I think that he and the Government of Cuba,
                        evidently, would declare demobilization and would appeal to the people to
                        get down to peaceful labor. Then, too, the question of armaments would
                        disappear, since, if there is no threat, then armaments are a burden for
                        every people. Then too, the question of the destruction, not only of the
                        armaments which you call offensive, but of all other armaments as well,
                        would look different.</p>
                    <p>I spoke in the name of the Soviet Government in the United Nations and
                        introduced a proposal for the disbandment of all armies and for the
                        destruction of all armaments. How then can I now count on those
                        armaments?</p>
                    <p>Armaments bring only disasters. When one accumulates them, this damages the
                        economy, and if one puts them to use, then they destroy people on both
                        sides. Consequently, only a madman can believe that armaments are the
                        principal means in the life of society. No, they are an enforced loss of
                        human energy, and what is more are for the destruction of man himself. If
                        people do not show wisdom, then in the final analysis they will come to a
                        clash, like blind moles, and then reciprocal extermination will begin.</p>
                    <p>Let us therefore show statesmanlike wisdom. I propose: We, for our part, will
                        declare that our ships, bound for Cuba, will not carry any kind <pb n="177"
                            xml:id="pg_177" facs="0199"/>of armaments. You would declare that the
                        United States will not invade Cuba with its forces and will not support any
                        sort of forces which might intend to carry out an invasion of Cuba. Then the
                        necessity for the presence of our military specialists in Cuba would
                        disappear.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, I appeal to you to weigh well what the aggressive, piratical
                        actions, which you have declared the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>
                        intends to carry out in international waters, would lead to. You yourself
                        know that any sensible man simply cannot agree with this, cannot recognize
                        your right to such actions.</p>
                    <p>If you did this as the first step towards the unleashing of war, well then,
                        it is evident that nothing else is left to us but to accept this challenge
                        of yours. If, however, you have not lost your self-control and sensibly
                        conceive what this might lead to, then, Mr. President, we and you ought not
                        now to pull on the ends of the rope in which you have tied the knot of war,
                        because the more the two of us pull, the tighter that knot will be tied. And
                        a moment may come when that knot will be tied so tight that even he who tied
                        it will not have the strength to untie it, and then it will be necessary to
                        cut that knot, and what that would mean is not for me to explain to you,
                        because you yourself understand perfectly of what terrible forces our
                        countries dispose.</p>
                    <p>Consequently, if there is no intention to tighten that knot and thereby to
                        doom the world to the catastrophe of thermonuclear war, then let us not only
                        relax the forces pulling on the ends of the rope, let us take measures to
                        untie that knot. We are ready for this.</p>
                    <p>We welcome all forces which stand on positions of peace. Consequently, I
                        expressed gratitude to Mr. Bertrand Russell, too, who manifests alarm and
                        concern for the fate of the world, and I readily responded to the appeal of
                        the Acting Secretary General of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,U
                        Thant.</p>
                    <p>There, Mr. President, are my thoughts, which, if you agreed with them, could
                        put an end to that tense situation which is disturbing all peoples.</p>
                    <p>These thoughts are dictated by a sincere desire to relieve the situation, to
                        remove the threat of war.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>, I have studied with great
                        satisfaction your reply to Mr. Thant concerning measures that should be
                        taken to avoid contact between our vessels and thereby avoid irreparable and
                        fatal consequences.<note n="1" xml:id="d66fn1">Regarding this message, see
                            vol. XI, <ref target="#d59">Document 59</ref>.</note> This reasonable
                        step on your part strengthens my belief that you are showing concern for the
                        preservation of peace, which I note with satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>I have already said that our people, our Government, and I personally, as
                        Chairman of the Council of Ministers, are concerned solely with having our
                        country develop and occupy a worthy place among all peoples of the world in
                        economic competition, in the development of culture and the arts, and in
                        raising the living standard of the people. This is the most noble and
                        necessary field for competition, and both the victor and the vanquished will
                        derive only benefit from it, because it means peace and an increase in the
                        means by which man lives and finds enjoyment.</p>
                    <p>In your statement you expressed the opinion that the main aim was not simply
                        to come to an agreement and take measures to prevent contact between our
                        vessels and consequently a deepening of the crisis which could, as a result
                        of such contacts spark a military conflict, after which all negotiations
                        would be superfluous because other forces and other laws would then come
                        into play—the laws of war. I agree with you that this is only the first
                        step. The main thing that must be done is to normalize and stabilize the
                        state of peace among states and among peoples.</p>
                    <p>I understand your concern for the security of the United States, Mr.
                        President, because this is the primary duty of a President. But we too are
                        disturbed about these same questions; I bear these same obligations as
                        Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R. You have been alarmed
                        by the fact that we have aided Cuba with weapons, in order to strengthen its
                        defense capability—precisely defense capability—because whatever weapons it
                        may possess, Cuba cannot be equated with you since the difference in
                        magnitude is so great, particularly in view of modern means of destruction.
                        Our aim has been and is to help Cuba, and no one can dispute the humanity of
                        our motives, which are oriented toward <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179"
                            facs="0201"/>enabling Cuba to live peacefully and develop in the way its
                        people desire.</p>
                    <p>You wish to ensure the security of your country, and this is understandable.
                        But Cuba, too, wants the same thing; all countries want to maintain their
                        security. But how are we, the Soviet Union, our Government, to assess your
                        actions which are expressed in the fact that you have surrounded the Soviet
                        Union with military bases; surrounded our allies with military bases; placed
                        military bases literally around our country; and stationed your missile
                        armaments there? This is no secret. Responsible American personages openly
                        declare that it is so. Your missiles are located in Britain, are located in
                        Italy, and are aimed against us. Your missiles are located in Turkey.</p>
                    <p>You are disturbed over Cuba. You say that this disturbs you because it is 90
                        miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America. But Turkey
                        adjoins us; our sentries patrol back and forth and see each other. Do you
                        consider, then, that you have the right to demand security for your own
                        country and the removal of the weapons you call offensive, but do not accord
                        the same right to us? You have placed destructive missile weapons, which you
                        call offensive, in Turkey, literally next to us. How then can recognition of
                        our equal military capacities be reconciled with such unequal relations
                        between our great states? This is irreconcilable.</p>
                    <p>It is good, Mr. President, that you have agreed to have our represent-atives
                        meet and begin talks, apparently through the mediation of U Thant, Acting
                        Secretary General of the United Nations. Consequently, he to some degree has
                        assumed the role of a mediator and we consider that he will be able to cope
                        with this responsible mission, provided, of course, that each party drawn
                        into this controversy displays good will.</p>
                    <p>I think it would be possible to end the controversy quickly and normalize the
                        situation, and then the people could breathe more easily, considering that
                        statesmen charged with responsibility are of sober mind and have an
                        awareness of their responsibility combined with the ability to solve complex
                        questions and not bring things to a military catastrophe.</p>
                    <p>I therefore make this proposal: We are willing to remove from Cuba the means
                        which you regard as offensive. We are willing to carry this out and to make
                        this pledge in the United Nations. Your representatives will make a
                        declaration to the effect that the United States, for its part, considering
                        the uneasiness and anxiety of the Soviet State, will remove its analogous
                        means from Turkey. Let us reach agreement as to the period of time needed by
                        you and by us to bring this about. And, after that, persons entrusted by the
                        United Nations Security Council could inspect on the spot the fulfillment of
                        the pledges made. Of course, the permission of the Governments of Cuba and
                        Turkey is necessary for the entry into those countries of these
                        representatives and for the inspection of the fulfillment <pb n="180"
                            xml:id="pg_180" facs="0202"/>of the pledge made by each side. Of course
                        it would be best if these representatives enjoyed the confidence of the
                        Security Council as well as yours and mine—both the United States and the
                        Soviet Union—and also that of Turkey and Cuba. I do not think it would be
                        difficult to select people who would enjoy the trust and respect of all
                        parties concerned.</p>
                    <p>We, in making this pledge, in order to give satisfaction and hope of the
                        peoples of Cuba and Turkey and to strengthen their confidences in their
                        security, will make a statement within the framework of the Security Council
                        to the effect that the Soviet Government gives a solemn promise to respect
                        the inviolability of the borders and sovereignty of Turkey, not to interfere
                        in its internal affairs, not to invade Turkey, not to make available our
                        territory as a bridgehead for such an invasion, and that it would also
                        restrain those who contemplate committing aggression against Turkey, either
                        from the territory of the Soviet Union or from the territory of Turkey’s
                        other neighboring states.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government will make a similar statement within the
                        framework of the Security Council regarding Cuba. It will declare that the
                        United States will respect the inviolability of Cuba’s borders and its
                        sovereignty, will pledge not to interfere in its internal affairs, not to
                        invade Cuba itself or make its territory available as a bridgehead for such
                        an invasion, and will also restrain those who might contemplate committing
                        aggression against Cuba, either from the territory of the United States or
                        from the territory of Cuba’s other neighboring states.</p>
                    <p>Of course, for this we would have to come to an agreement with you and
                        specify a certain time limit. Let us agree to some period of time, but
                        without unnecessary delay—say within two or three weeks, not longer than a
                        month.</p>
                    <p>The means situated in Cuba, of which you speak and which disturb you, as you
                        have stated, are in the hands of Soviet officers. Therefore, any accidental
                        use of them to the detriment of the United States is excluded. These means
                        are situated in Cuba at the request of the Cuban Government and are only for
                        defense purposes. Therefore, if there is no invasion of Cuba, or attack on
                        the Soviet Union or any of our other allies, then of course these means are
                        not and will not be a threat to anyone. For they are not for purposes of
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>If you are agreeable to my proposal, Mr. President, then we would send our
                        representatives to New York, to the United Nations, and would give them
                        comprehensive instructions in order that an agreement may be reached more
                        quickly. If you also select your people and give them the corresponding
                        instructions, then this question can be quickly resolved.</p>
                    <p>Why would I like to do this? Because the whole world is now apprehensive and
                        expects sensible actions of us. The greatest joy for all peoples would be
                        the announcement of our agreement and of the eradication of the controversy
                        that has arisen. I attach great importance to this agreement <pb n="181"
                            xml:id="pg_181" facs="0203"/>in so far as it could serve as a good
                        beginning and could in particular make it easier to reach agreement on
                        banning nuclear weapons tests. The question of the tests could be solved in
                        parallel fashion, without connecting one with the other, because these are
                        different issues. However, it is important that agreement be reached on both
                        these issues so as to present humanity with a fine gift, and also to gladden
                        it with the news that agreement has been reached on the cessation of nuclear
                        tests and that consequently the atmosphere will no longer be poisoned. Our
                        position and yours on this issue are very close together.</p>
                    <p>All of this could possibly serve as a good impetus toward the finding of
                        mutually acceptable agreements on other controversial issues on which you
                        and I have been exchanging views. These issues have so far not been
                        resolved, but they are awaiting urgent solution, which would clear up the
                        international atmosphere. We are prepared for this.</p>
                    <p>These are my proposals, Mr. President.</p>

                            >Khrushchev</persName> should be delivered as soon as possible to
                        highest available Soviet official. Text has been handed Soviet Embassy in

                    <p>"Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I have read your letter of October 26th <note n="1" xml:id="d67fn1">See <ref
                                target="#d65">Document 65</ref>.</note> with great care and welcomed
                        the statement of your desire to seek a prompt solution to the problem.<pb
                            n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0204"/>The first thing that needs to be
                        done, however, is for work to cease on offensive missile bases in Cuba and
                        for all weapons systems in Cuba capable of offensive use to be rendered
                        inoperable, under effective United Nations arrangements.</p>
                    <p>Assuming this is done promptly, I have given my representatives in New York
                        instructions that will permit them to work out this weekend—in cooperation
                        with the Acting Secretary General and your representative—an arrangement for
                        a permanent solution to the Cuban problem along the lines suggested in your
                        letter of October 26th. As I read your letter, the key elements of your
                        proposals—which seem generally acceptable as I understand them—are as
                        follows: <list>
                            <label>1)</label>
                            <item>You would agree to remove these weapons systems from Cuba under
                                appropriate United Nations observation and supervision; and
                                undertake, with suitable safeguards, to halt the further
                                introduction of such weapons systems into Cuba.</item>
                            <label>2)</label>
                            <item>We, on our part, would agree—upon the establishment of adequate
                                arrangements through the United Nations to ensure the carrying out
                                and continuation of these commitments—(a) to remove promptly the
                                quarantine measures now in effect and (b) to give assurances against
                                an invasion of Cuba. I am confident that other nations of the
                                Western Hemisphere would be prepared to do likewise.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>If you will give your representative similar instructions, there is no reason
                        why we should not be able to complete these arrangements and announce them
                        to the world within a couple of days. The effect of such a settlement on
                        easing world tensions would enable us to work toward a more general
                        arrangement regarding ’other armaments’, as proposed in your second letter
                        which you made public.<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2"><ref target="#d66"
                                >Document 66</ref>.</note> I would like to say again that the United
                        States is very much interested in reducing tensions and halting the arms
                        race; and if your letter signifies that you are prepared to discuss a
                        detente affecting <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw Pact,
                        we are quite prepared to consider with our allies any useful proposals.</p>
                    <p>But the first ingredient, let me emphasize, is the cessation of work on
                        missile sites in Cuba and measures to render such weapons inoperable, under
                        effective international guarantees. The continuation of this threat, or a
                        prolonging of this discussion concerning Cuba by linking these problems to
                        the broader questions of European and world security, would surely lead to
                        an intensification of the Cuban crisis and a grave risk to the peace of the
                        world. For this reason I hope we can quickly agree along the lines in this
                        letter and in your letter of October 26th.</p>

                        October 27.<note n="1" xml:id="d68fn1">See <ref target="#d67">Document
                                67</ref>.</note> I express my satisfaction and thank you for the
                        sense of proportion you have displayed and for realization of the
                        responsibility which now devolves on you for the preservation of the peace
                        of the world.</p>
                    <p>I regard with great understanding your concern and the concern of the United
                        States people in connection with the fact that the weapons you describe as
                        offensive are formidable weapons indeed. Both you and we understand what
                        kind of weapons these are.</p>
                    <p>In order to eliminate as rapidly as possible the conflict which endangers the
                        cause of peace, to give an assurance to all people who crave peace, and to
                        reassure the American people, who, I am certain, also want peace, as do the
                        people of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Government, in addition to earlier
                        instructions on the discontinuation of further work on weapons construction
                        sites, has given a new order to dismantle the arms which you described as
                        offensive, and to crate and return them to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, I should like to repeat what I had already written to you in
                        my earlier messages—that the Soviet Government has given economic assistance
                        to the Republic of Cuba, as well as arms, because Cuba and the Cuban people
                        were constantly under the continuous threat of an invasion of Cuba.</p>
                    <p>A piratic vessel had shelled Havana. They say that this shelling was done by
                        irresponsible Cuban emigres. Perhaps so, however, the question is from where
                        did they shoot. It is a fact that these Cubans have no territory, they are
                        fugitives from their country, and they have no means to conduct military
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>This means that someone put into their hands these weapons for shelling
                        Havana and for piracy in the Caribbean in Cuban territorial waters. It is
                        impossible in our time not to notice a piratic ship, considering the
                        concentration in the Caribbean of American ships from which everything can
                        be seen and observed.</p>
                    <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0206"/>
                    <p>In these conditions, pirate ships freely roam around and shell Cuba and make
                        piratic attacks on peaceful cargo ships. It is known that they even shelled
                        a British cargo ship. In a word, Cuba was under the continuous threat of
                        aggressive forces, which did not conceal their intention to invade its
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>The Cuban people want to build their life in their own interests without
                        external interference. This is their right, and they cannot be blamed for
                        wanting to be masters of their own country and disposing of the fruits of
                        their own labor.</p>
                    <p>The threat of invasion of Cuba and all other schemes for creating tension
                        over Cuba are designed to strike the Cuban people with a sense of
                        insecurity, intimidate them, and prevent them from peacefully building their
                        new life.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, I should like to say clearly once more that we could not
                        remain indifferent to this. The Soviet Government decided to render
                        assistance to Cuba with the means of defense against aggression—only with
                        means for defense purposes. We have supplied the defense means which you
                        describe as offensive means. We have supplied them to prevent an attack on
                        Cuba—to prevent rash acts.</p>
                    <p>I regard with respect and trust the statement you made in your message of
                        October 27, 1962, that there would be no attack, no invasion of Cuba, and
                        not only on the part of the United States, but also on the part of other
                        nations of the Western Hemisphere, as you said in your same message. Then
                        the motives which induced us to render assistance of such a kind to Cuba
                        disappear.</p>
                    <p>It is for this reason that we instructed our officers—these means as I had
                        already informed you earlier are in the hands of the Soviet officers—to take
                        appropriate measures to discontinue construction of the aforementioned
                        facilities, to dismantle them, and to return them to the Soviet Union. As I
                        had informed you in the letter of October 27, <note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2"
                                ><ref target="#d66">Document 66</ref>.</note> we are prepared to
                        reach agreement to enable United Nations Representatives to verify the
                        dismantling of these means.</p>
                    <p>Thus in view of the assurance you have given and our instructions on
                        dismantling, there is every condition for eliminating the present
                        conflict.</p>
                    <p>I note with satisfaction that you have responded to the desire I expressed
                        with regard to elimination of the aforementioned dangerous situation, as
                        well as with regard to providing conditions for a more thoughtful appraisal
                        of the internal situation, fraught as it is with great dangers in our age of
                        thermonuclear weapons, rocketry, spaceships, global rockets, and other
                        deadly weapons. All people are interested in insuring peace.</p>
                    <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0207"/>
                    <p>Therefore, vested with trust and great responsibility, we must not allow the
                        situation to become aggravated and must stamp out the centers where a
                        dangerous situation fraught with grave consequences to the cause of peace
                        has arisen. If we, together with you, and with the assistance of other
                        people of good will, succeed in eliminating this tense atmosphere, we should
                        also make certain that no other dangerous conflicts which could lead to a
                        world nuclear catastrophe would arise.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, I should like to say something about a detente between <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw Treaty countries that you
                        have mentioned. We have spoken about this long since and are prepared to
                        continue to exchange views on this question with you and to find a
                        reasonable solution.</p>
                    <p>We should like to continue the exchange of views on the prohibition of atomic
                        and thermonuclear weapons, general disarmament, and other problems relating
                        to the relaxation of international tension.</p>
                    <p>Although I trust your statement, Mr. President, there are irresponsible
                        people who would like to invade Cuba now and thus touch off a war. If we do
                        take practical steps and proclaim the dismantling and evacuation of the
                        means in question from Cuba, in so doing we, at the same time, want the
                        Cuban people to be certain that we are with them and are not absolving
                        ourselves of responsibility for rendering assistance to the Cuban
                        people.</p>
                    <p>We are confident that the people of all countries, like you, Mr. President,
                        will understand me correctly. We are not threatening. We want nothing but
                        peace. Our country is now on the upsurge.</p>
                    <p>Our people are enjoying the fruits of their peaceful labor. They have
                        achieved tremendous successes since the October Revolution, and created the
                        greatest material, spiritual, and cultural values. Our people are enjoying
                        these values; they want to continue developing their achievements and insure
                        their further development on the way of peace and social progress by their
                        persistent labor.</p>
                    <p>I should like to remind you, Mr. President, that military reconnaissance
                        planes have violated the borders of the Soviet Union. In connection with
                        this there have been conflicts between us and notes exchanged. In 1960 we
                        shot down your U-2 plane, whose reconnaissance flight over the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wrecked the summit meeting in Paris. At
                        that time, you took a correct position and denounced that criminal act of
                        the former U.S. Administration.</p>
                    <p>But during your term of office as President another violation of our border
                        has occurred, by an American U-2 plane in the Sakhalin area. We wrote you
                        about the violation on 30 August. At that time you replied that that
                        violation had occurred as a result of poor weather, and gave assurances that
                        this would not be repeated. We trusted your assurance, because the weather
                        was indeed poor in that area at that time.</p>
                    <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0208"/>
                    <p>But had not your planes been ordered to fly about our territory, even poor
                        weather could not have brought an American plane into our airspace. Hence,
                        the conclusion that this is being done with the knowledge of the Pentagon,
                        which tramples on international norms and violates the borders of other
                        states.</p>
                    <p>A still more dangerous case occurred on 28 October, when one of your
                        reconnaissance planes intruded over Soviet borders in the Chukotka Peninsula
                        area in the north and flew over our territory. The question is, Mr.
                        President: How should we regard this. What is this: A provocation? One of
                        your planes violates our frontier during this anxious time we are both
                        experiencing, when everything has been put into combat readiness. Is it not
                        a fact that an intruding American plane could be easily taken for a nuclear
                        bomber, which might push us to a fateful step? And all the more so since the
                        U.S. Government and Pentagon long ago declared that you are maintaining a
                        continuous nuclear bomber patrol.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, you can imagine the responsibility you are assuming especially
                        now, when we are living through such anxious times.</p>
                    <p>I should like to express the following wish; it concerns the Cuban people.
                        You do not have diplomatic relations. But through my officers in Cuba, I
                        have reports that American planes are making flights over Cuba.</p>
                    <p>We are interested that there should be no war in the world, and that the
                        Cuban people should live in peace. And besides, Mr. President, it is no
                        secret that we have our people in Cuba. Under such a treaty with the Cuban
                        Government we have sent there officers, instructors, mostly plain people:
                        specialists, agronomists, zoo technicians, irrigators, land reclamation
                        specialists, plain workers, tractor drivers, and others. We are concerned
                        about them.</p>
                    <p>I should like you to consider, Mr. President, that violation of Cuban
                        airspace by American planes could also lead to dangerous consequences. And
                        if you do not want this to happen, it would [be] better if no cause is given
                        for a dangerous situation to arise.</p>
                    <p>We must be careful now and refrain from any steps which would not be useful
                        to the defense of the states involved in the conflict, which could only
                        cause irritation and even serve as a provocation for a fateful step.
                        Therefore, we must display sanity, reason, and refrain from such steps.</p>
                    <p>We value peace perhaps even more than other peoples because we went through a
                        terrible war with Hitler. But our people will not falter in the face of any
                        test. Our people trust their Government, and we assure our people and world
                        public opinion that the Soviet Government will not allow itself to be
                        provoked. But if the provocateurs unleash a war, they will not evade
                        responsibility and the grave consequences a war would bring upon them. But
                        we are confident that reason will triumph <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187"
                            facs="0209"/>that war will not be unleashed and peace and the security
                        of the peoples will be insured.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the current negotiations between Acting Secretary General
                        U Thant and representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the
                        Republic of Cuba, the Soviet Government has sent First Deputy Foreign

                    <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I am replying at once to your broadcast message of October twenty-eight <note
                            n="1" xml:id="d69fn1">See <ref target="#d68">Document 68</ref>.</note>
                        even though the official text has not yet reached me because of the great
                        importance I attach to moving forward promptly to the settlement of the
                        Cuban crisis. I think that you and I, with our heavy responsibilities for
                        the maintenance of peace, were aware that developments were approaching a
                        point where events could have become unmanageable. So I welcome this message
                        and consider it an important contribution to peace.</p>
                    <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0210"/>
                    <p>The distinguished efforts of Acting Secretary General U Thant have greatly
                        facilitated both our tasks. I consider my letter to you of October
                        twenty-seventh <note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">See <ref target="#d67">Document
                                67</ref>.</note> and your reply of today as firm undertakings on the
                        part of both our governments which should be promptly carried out. I hope
                        that the necessary measures can at once be taken through the United Nations
                        as your message says, so that the United States in turn can remove the
                        quarantine measures now in effect. I have already made arrangements to
                        report all these matters to the Organization of American States, whose
                        members share a deep interest in a genuine peace in the Caribbean area.</p>
                    <p>You referred in your letter to a violation of your frontier by an American
                        aircraft in the area of the Chukotsk Peninsula. I have learned that this
                        plane, without arms or photographic equipment, was engaged in an air
                        sampling mission in connection with your nuclear tests. Its course was
                        direct from Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska to the North Pole and return.
                        In turning south, the pilot made a serious navigational error which carried
                        him over Soviet territory. He immediately made an emergency call on open
                        radio for navigational assistance and was guided back to his home base by
                        the most direct route. I regret this incident and will see to it that every
                        precaution is taken to prevent recurrence.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chairman, both of our countries have great unfinished tasks and I know
                        that your people as well as those of the United States can ask for nothing
                        better than to pursue them free from the fear of war. Modern science and
                        technology have given us the possibility of making labor fruitful beyond
                        anything that could have been dreamed of a few decades ago.</p>
                    <p>I agree with you that we must devote urgent attention to the problem of
                        disarmament, as it relates to the whole world and also to critical areas.
                        Perhaps now, as we step back from danger, we can together make real progress
                        in this vital field. I think we should give priority to questions relating
                        to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, on earth and in outer space, and to
                        the great effort for a nuclear test ban. But we should also work hard to see
                        if wider measures of disarmament can be agreed and put into operation at an
                        early date. The United States Government will be prepared to discuss these
                        questions urgently, and in a constructive spirit, at Geneva or
                        elsewhere.</p>

                        which took place on October 27. In this conversation <persName

                        difficult for you at the present time to publicly discuss the question of
                        eliminating the US missile bases in Turkey because of the fact that the
                        stationing of those bases in Turkey was formalized through a <gloss

                    <p>Readiness to agree on this issue that I raised in my message to you of

                            corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName> said that removal of those
                        bases from Turkey would take 4 to 5 months. Furthermore, a wish was

                        continue through <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName> and
                        the Soviet Ambassador, and that these exchanges should be considered

                    <p>I feel I must state to you that I do understand the delicacy involved for you
                        in an open consideration of the issue of eliminating the US missile bases in

                        are right about not wishing to publicly discuss it. I agree that our
                        discussion of this subject be pursued confidentially through <persName

                        Washington. You may have noticed that in my message to you on October 28,
                        which was to be published immediately, I did not raise this
                        question—precisely because I was mindful of your wish conveyed through
                            <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName>. But all the
                        proposals that I presented in that message took into account the fact that
                        you had agreed to resolve, [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]<note n="2"

                    <p>I hope, Mr. President, that agreement on this matter, too, shall be a no
                        small step advancing the cause of relaxation of international tensions and
                        the tensions between our two powers. And that in turn can provide a good
                        impetus to resolving other issues concerning both the security of Europe and
                        the international situation as a whole.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, the crisis that we have gone through may repeat again. This
                        means that we need to address the issues which contain too much explosive
                        material. Not right away, of course. Apparently, it will take some time for
                        the passions to cool down. But we cannot delay the solution to these issues,
                        for continuation of this situation is frought [sic] with many uncertainties
                        and dangers.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>, I want to convey to you
                        confidentially some considerations which, if you agree with them, could
                        serve, in my opinion, our common cause, that is, prompt elimination of the
                        remnants of the dangerous crisis which you and we have in the main
                        liquidated. This would help to finalize the settlement more quickly so that
                        life would resume its normal pace.</p>
                    <p>First of all, I would like to express a wish that you already now remove the
                        quarantine without waiting for the procedure for the inspection of ships on
                        which an agreement has been reached to be put into effect. It would be very
                        reasonable on your part. You yourself realize that the quarantine will in
                        fact accomplish nothing since those ships that are now heading for Cuba
                        naturally, after we have agreed on the removal of our missiles from Cuba, do
                        not carry not only any offensive weapons, but as I have already stated it
                        publicly and informed you confidentially, any <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191"
                            facs="0213"/>weapons at all. Immediate lift of the quarantine would be a
                        good gesture. It would be appreciated both by us and world public opinion as
                        a major step to speed up liquidation of the aftereffects of the crisis. For
                        all practical purposes the quarantine is of no use to you, but being a
                        manifestation of the crisis, it continues to poison relations among states,
                        relations between you and us and Cuba and produces a depressing effect on
                        world public which would like to see a complete relaxation. You would lose
                        nothing but you would score a gain as far as public opinion is
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, immediate lift of the quarantine would give us an
                        opportunity to use our ships that are approaching Cuba to take out the
                        weapons which are being dismantled now and, I think, have been already
                        dismantled. After the ships are unloaded the dismantled weapons could be
                        loaded on them and shipped to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, after the elimination of the crisis it is impossible to continue
                        the blockade and discrimination in trade and communications. All this must
                        be done away with. But you, as we know, undertook measures and put pressure
                        on your allies and other countries so that even flights of civilian
                        passenger planes be not permitted. Do you really think that IL-28 carries
                        any means of destruction? This is laughable.</p>
                    <p>All this is being done not to ensure security, but as pinpricks and cannot
                        but cause irritation and worsening of our relations. Why should it be done?
                        Who needs it? It serves only the aggressive forces to strain nerves and thus
                        to reach their goal which is to push the world into the abyss of a
                        thermonuclear war.</p>
                    <p>Therefore I believe that you, Mr. President, will understand me correctly and
                        will draw appropriate conclusions aimed at clearing the way for bettering
                        the relations between our states.</p>
                    <p>Next question. I do not know what you will think about it but if you were
                        prepared already now to proclaim the liquidation of your base in Guantanamo,
                        this would be an act which would give world public opinion real satisfaction
                        and would contribute to the easing of tension. I think that you yourself
                        realize what significance the base in Guantanamo may have now after your
                        statement that you do not pursue the aim of invading Cuba. Then the question
                        arises: at whom this base is aimed, what purposes does it serve, from whom
                        can it guard the approaches to America? I do not see forces that can
                        threaten America from that direction. Therefore the base in Guantanamo is
                        only a burden for your budget, and what is the main thing, it is a great
                        burden of a moral nature for political leaders in the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>. And everybody realizes that the functions
                        of the base in Guantanamo—and this is in fact the case—are aggressive, not
                        defensive.</p>
                    <p>You know our position with regard to the bases. We are against military bases
                        in general and that’s why we liquidated those our bases that we had in
                        Finland and China and we think that we acted rightly. That <pb n="192"
                            xml:id="pg_192" facs="0214"/>was an act that manifested our good
                        intentions in ensuring peaceful coexistence. By that we did not diminish our
                        defensive capability but raised our moral prestige among the peoples of all
                        the world. The more true it is now when there are perfect means of war, the
                        range and destructive power of which are so great that no bases could in any
                        degree replace them.</p>
                    <p>This would be a good preparation to an agreement between you and us on the
                        liquidation of all military bases in general since military bases have lost
                        now their importance. Those are not my words. I think, you yourself said and
                        even stated it publicly that you want to reduce the number of your military
                        bases. Of this spoke Bowles and others, and they spoke correctly.</p>
                    <p>Such your step would be highly appreciated by world public.</p>
                    <p>I would like also to tell you my following consideration.</p>
                    <p>My colleagues and I consider that both sides have displayed restraint and
                        wisdom in liquidating the military conflict which might have resulted in a
                        world thermonuclear war. I take the liberty to think that you evidently held
                        to a restraining position with regard to those forces which suffered from
                        militaristic itching. And we take a notice of that. I don’t know, perhaps I
                        am wrong, but in this letter I am making the conclusion on the basis that in
                        your country the situation is such that the decisive word rests with the
                        President and if he took an extreme stand there would be no one to restrain
                        him and war would be unleashed. But as this did not happen and we found a
                        reasonable compromise having made mutual concessions to each other and on
                        this basis eliminated the crisis which could explode in the catastrophe of a
                        thermonuclear war, then, evidently, your role here was restraining. We so
                        believe, and we note and appreciate it.</p>
                    <p>Our systems are different and my role was simpler than yours because there
                        were no people around me who wanted to unleash war. My efforts aimed at
                        eliminating the conflict were supported by both our military men and my
                        colleagues in the leadership of the party and government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, we have now conditions ripe for finalizing the agreement on
                        signing a treaty on cessation of tests of thermonuclear weapons. We fully
                        agree with regard to three types of tests or, so to say, tests in three
                        environments. This is banning of tests in atmosphere, in outer space and
                        under water. In this respect we are of the same opinion and we are ready to
                        sign an agreement.</p>
                    <p>But there are still some differences with regard to underground explosions.
                        Therefore it would be good if you gave instructions to find a compromise in
                        the decision on the underground test ban, but without inspection. We shall
                        not accept inspection, this I say to you unequivocally and frankly. Of
                        course, if one aims at delaying or torpedoing an agreement <pb n="193"
                            xml:id="pg_193" facs="0215"/>then there is sense in insisting on the
                        inspection of underground explosions.</p>
                    <p>We do not carry on underground tests, we did it but once and we are not going
                        to do it anymore. Maybe such a necessity will arise sometime in future, but
                        in any case I do not envisage it.</p>
                    <p>It would be very useful to agree on ending tests after such strain when
                        people lived through great anxiety. It would be a great reward for the
                        nervous strain suffered by the peoples of all countries. I think that your
                        people felt as much anxiety as all other peoples expecting that
                        thermonuclear war would break out any moment. And we were very close to such
                        war indeed. That is why it would be good to give satisfaction to the public
                        opinion. This would contribute to easing the tension.</p>
                    <p>We appreciate it very much that you took the initiative and in such a moment
                        of crisis stated your readiness to conduct negotiations with the purpose of
                        signing a non-aggression treaty between the two military blocs. We responded
                        and supported it. We are prepared to come to an agreement on this question
                        confidentially or through diplomatic channels and then make it public and
                        start negotiations. This also would contribute to lessening tension. The
                        world public would learn with satisfaction that in the moment of crisis not
                        only declarative statements were made but certain commitments with
                        signatures affixed were taken as well.</p>
                    <p>But the best thing to do would be—I do not know how you will look upon it—to
                        disband all military blocs. We are not coming up with this now though we
                        spoke of this before; however we believe now too that this would be most
                        reasonable. But if you and your allies are not ready yet for that we are not
                        pressing. However I must say that in the interests of the same elimination
                        of tension this would be greatly useful.</p>
                    <p>We have eliminated a serious crisis. But in order to forsee and forestall
                        appearance of a new crisis in future which might be impossible to cope with
                        everything in our relations capable of generating a new crisis should be
                        erased now. It would seem that now when we possess thermonuclear weapons,
                        rocket weapons, submarine fleet and other means the situation obliges all
                        states, every state to adhere to such norms of conduct which would not
                        generate conflicts, to say nothing of wars. From our point of view, this is
                        quite obtainable. This would be a big step forward at a time when we in
                        effect have not yet disarmed. I think that this would be not a loss but a
                        gain for the supporters of peaceful coexistence, a mutual benefit which the
                        peoples of the U.S. and other countries participating in military blocs
                        would enjoy. It can also be said with confidence that this would be highly
                        appreciated by all peoples and would give great reassurance and satisfaction
                        to people interested in securing peace. More efforts should be made already
                        now to solve the problem of disarmament. <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194"
                            facs="0216"/>To do it with regard not to one stage but to a real
                        solution of the whole problem.</p>
                    <p>In our proposals on general and complete disarmament which we have made we
                        have taken into consideration your wishes as well. Our recent proposals on

                    <p>And of course, Mr. President, I am again reminding you of the necessity to
                        solve the German question because next crisis, possibly of no lesser danger,
                        can be caused by the German question. And the main thing is that that crisis
                        will be foolish as all crises are.</p>
                    <p>There was war, two German states emerged, or actually three states, which are
                        in existence since the end of World War II. Specific relations among them
                        have already developed. But these relations—economic and political—exist
                        because the German Democratic Republic regulates traffic through its
                        territory on the basis of some substitutes for treaties though in reality,
                        daily life, in practice such treaties are already operative.</p>
                    <p>Besides, we and you, our Foreign Minister and your Secretary of State, have
                        agreed on all questions. And the only question which remains unsolved is
                        that the presence of troops in West Berlin and in effect not even of the
                        troops but under what flag those troops will be and of what states,
                        naturally within certain period of time.</p>
                    <p>Could not we both understand it? And who needs that the present unsolved
                        situation continue? Not you and not your people. This is not in our or your
                        interests, and not in the interests of our or your allies. This is only—and
                        I repeat again—in the interests of revanchist forces who do not want to
                        recognize the borders and conditions emerged as a result of the defeat of
                        the Hitlerite Germany. Only they benefit from that. Nobody else.</p>
                    <p>Who expresses such policy now—<persName>Adenauer</persName> or somebody
                        else—that is of no particular importance to me or to you. But if one takes a
                        realistic view, if you, Mr. President, analyze the situation then you in
                        your heart will undoubtedly agree with me. What you say publicly is another
                        matter. But that comes not from how you personally understand the situation
                        but, so to say, from political expedience, from desire “not to offend” your
                        ally. However it would be better to be guided by a desire not to offend the
                        public opinion and to give satisfaction to it, to give satisfaction to all
                        peoples, the American people included—to eliminate the hotbed of
                        international tension in the center of Europe. And we would be able to
                        eliminate it. If you and we come to an agreement on this question—and we do
                        want it—this would be a great joy for all peoples because this would mean
                        consolidation of peace.</p>
                    <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0217"/>
                    <p>There would remain many unsettled matters in the world but the main thing
                        after that—and I would like to tell you about it—is the question of China.
                        It is anomalous that China is not having her seat in the U.N. Similar
                        anomalies already existed in history and were overwhelmed by life. When the
                        Revolution broke out and won in America and Russian Emperor showed
                        stubbornness and did not recognize America for 26 years. But America did not
                        cease to exist because of that. So, that was a foolish policy. The United
                        States answered with the same lack of cleverness. But that happened,
                        however, in different times. Therefore the U.S. acted unreasonably for
                        roughly half that time: the Russian Emperor—for 26 years, you—for 16 years.
                        But then the U.S. realized that it was unwise, and your great President
                        Roosevelt took the courage and responsibility and displayed wisdom.</p>
                    <p>You would greatly raise your prestige, personal and that of your country, in
                        the eyes of the peoples if you take an attitude facilitating China taking
                        its lawful seat in the U.N. This is possible only if it is understood that
                        there cannot be two Chinas. No state which respects itself can agree to a
                        part of its territory, a part of its population being cut off, it applies
                        even more strongly to a great power. This is an internal question of China
                        and let the Chinese decide it among themselves. When China participated in
                        the creation of the U.N. and when it was made a permanent member of the
                        Security Council, then it was one China. And that one China exists now. If
                        China occupies again its lawful seat in the U.N., if you understand the
                        necessity of it—and I think that you do understand it—then it would be good,
                        it would be a great contribution to the cause of peace.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to come to an agreement on disarmament without China. There
                        are countries with population of half a million and even less which are
                        members of the U.N. and have voice in this international organization.
                        Iceland, for instance has the population of 180 thousand people. China has
                        650 million people and does not have such voice. We have respect for the
                        people of Iceland and their will as well as for all peoples. But from the
                        point of view of ensuring peace—even if there seems to be a contradiction
                        here—the contribution of a given people and that of another people, the real
                        contribution to the cause of ensuring peace may be different.</p>
                    <p>Therefore it would be proper to solve the question of the restoration of
                        China’s rights in the U.N.; the peoples are waiting for it. And this will
                        happen, it is only a matter of time. Therefore in order not to prolong this
                        time, if you understood now the necessity for such a step, then, it would in
                        effect be possible to solve this problem at the present session of General
                        Assembly. What satisfaction it would give to the world public opinion, you
                        would see from the expression of feelings of all peoples because it would be
                        a real step, indeed, towards stabilization and strengthening of peace all
                        over the world.</p>
                    <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0218"/>
                    <p>We, the Soviet people and the peoples of Asian and Europe countries, saw war.
                        War often rolled through our territory. America participated in the two wars
                        but it suffered very small losses in those wars. While huge profits were
                        accumulated as result of the wars. Of course, it was monopolists who
                        benefited but workers, working people got something out of it, too. War did
                        not touch the soil of the United States. The American people did not
                        experience destruction, sufferings, they only received notifications about
                        deaths of their kin. Now during this crisis war was knocking at the gates of
                        America.</p>
                    <p>These, in effect, are my considerations after the crisis situation. I want to
                        tell you that in this crisis, as our saying goes, there is no evil without
                        good. Evil has brought some good. The good is that now people have felt more
                        tangibly the breathing of the burning flames of thermonuclear war and have a
                        more clear realization of the threat looming over them if arms race is not
                        stopped. And I would say that what has just happened will serve especially
                        good the American people.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, I believe that you as a military man, and your military people
                        understand that we were not preparing for war when we delivered means of
                        defense to Cuba. Those means were not meant against the U.S., but were the
                        means to ensure the security of Cuba. Do you really think that we are so
                        narrow-minded in our understanding of military matters that in preparing for
                        war against the U.S. we picked up Cuba as a bridgehead for such a war? And
                        the means there—a certain number of missiles. This is foolish. For Cuba is
                        no good as a bridgehead for a big war and it cannot be used for those
                        purposes and, of course, nobody ever contemplated that. Those were the means
                        for deterring aggressor, to use the language of the late Dulles.</p>
                    <p>It is our opinion that the crisis has been eliminated on the compromise basis
                        through reciprocal concessions. We are satisfied with it. We also appreciate
                        your cooperation in the elimination of the crisis and your understanding of
                        the necessity for reciprocal concessions and compromise so that the conflict
                        be prevented from going beyond the limits that might really break into a
                        thermonuclear war. All the peoples of the world, the peoples of the United
                        States and the Soviet Union as well as the peoples of all countries, are
                        interested in eliminating this conflict. In particular, I think, it will be
                        highly appreciated by the people of Cuba who have now been assured that
                        their borders will be respected and there will be no threat of invasion of
                        their land on the part of stronger states. In other words, the Cuban people
                        will have the long-awaited opportunity to enjoy the benefits of their labor
                        and they will have the guarantee of their independence on the basis of the
                        U.N. Charter which provides for non-interference into internal affairs of
                        other states and respect for sovereignty and integrity of state.</p>
                    <p>These are the considerations, Mr. President, which I wanted to express to
                        you. I understand that I listed a great number of questions. <pb n="197"
                            xml:id="pg_197" facs="0219"/>Therefore, if we started after breakfast we
                        would not have finished solving them before dinner. It would require more
                        time but they have to be solved. They face the world. And the more we delay
                        the solution of these questions, the more of unknown will appear which can
                        prove to be fatal in a future crisis. Therefore, the sooner we clear away
                        the roadblock, the windfallen wood, which has piled up in the international
                        relations, and make clear the roads to correct mutual understanding the
                        better it would be.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, you lived through this crisis yourself. For us too, it
                        presented the Rubicon: whether to agree to a compromise, whether to make
                        concessions. Indeed, from the point of view of the legal standards your
                        claims had no grounds whatsoever. Therefore there was a great trial and
                        there were hesitations. We still believed, however, that you might have
                        difficulties too since how could it be that you could not know that the
                        unjustified demands of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> exposed the
                        world to the hazards of catastrophe. However, we decided to make a
                        compromise proposal which would suit both you and us. We received your
                        assurances that you would not invade Cuba and would not permit others to do
                        it and on this condition we withdrew the weapons which you called offensive.
                        As a result, there has been practically achieved the purpose which had been
                        intended to be achieved through the shipments of means of defense. Now this
                        question is solved on these compromise and reciprocal concessions.</p>
                    <p>And we consider it to be reasonable. Having eliminated this crisis we gave
                        each other mutual satisfaction: you promised not to attack and not to permit
                        attack against Cuba on the part of others, and we moved forward to make the
                            <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> feel confident that we do not
                        contemplate anything bad against it and that there is no threat against the
                            <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> on our part. You certainly possess
                        means of destruction. But you know that we also have these means and they
                        are of a different nature than those that were in Cuba. Those were trifles
                        there. Our means were brought to the state of combat readiness, they were of
                        a more serious nature and they were pointed at the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                            >USA</gloss> and your allies.</p>
                    <p>To our mutual satisfaction we maybe even sacrificed self-esteem. Apparently,
                        there will be such scribblers who will engage in hair-splitting over our
                        agreement, will be digging as to who made greater concessions to whom. As
                        for me, I would say that we both made a concession to reason and found a
                        reasonable solution which enabled us to ensure peace for all including those
                        who will be trying to dig up something.</p>
                    <p>Such is our understanding of this whole question.</p>
                    <p>I would like to sum up the above said and express in conclusion the following
                        considerations on the questions touched upon in this letter.</p>
                    <p>I think it would be possible to pick up from the questions listed by me those
                        which are more ripe and which should, perhaps, be prepared for taking
                        decisions on them. Then it would be possible to meet, maybe, <pb n="198"
                            xml:id="pg_198" facs="0220"/>at the U.N. or may be at a specially
                        arranged meeting. I repeat, I have in mind a meeting in case questions are
                        prepared for taking decisions on them so that the appropriate agreements
                        could be signed during the meeting. It would be a good gift for the peoples
                        of the whole world.</p>
                    <p>We have a different understanding of the mentioned questions. Therefore I
                        would like to know your considerations as to whether you believe that some
                        or other of the questions raised by me are ripe for decision. If you do not
                        consider them ripe, then there should be no meeting because a meeting in
                        such conditions would not only fail to justify hopes of the peoples, but
                        would distress them.</p>

                        arrangements can be worked out quickly by the United Nations which would
                        permit its removal. We were happy to agree to your suggestion that the
                        International Committee of the Red Cross undertake responsibility for
                        inspection. You are, of course, aware that Premier <persName
                            corresp="#p_CRF1">Castro</persName> has announced his opposition to
                        measures of verification on the territory of Cuba. If he maintains this
                        position this would raise very serious problems. So far as incoming
                        shipments are concerned, I understand that efforts are being made to have
                        the International Red Cross carry out the necessary measures at sea and I
                        hope that these will be successful. In the <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199"
                            facs="0221"/>meantime, perhaps the existence of the quarantine can be of
                        assistance to Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> in his
                        negotiations with Premier <persName corresp="#p_CRF1">Castro</persName>. I
                        should also like to point out that in an effort to facilitate matters, I
                        instructed our delegation in New York to inform your representative there,
                            Mr.<persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName>, that for the next
                        few days any Soviet ships in the quarantine area would be passed without
                        inspection and only the hailing procedure which was carried out in the case
                        of your vessel, the <hi rend="italic">Bucharest</hi>, would be applied.</p>
                    <p>I am hopeful we can dispose of this pressing matter quickly so that we can go
                        on in a better atmosphere to the broader questions. We both must make our
                        best efforts to this end.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>, I have just received
                        information from Mr.<persName corresp="#p_KVV2">V. Kuznetsov</persName>, our
                        representative at the negotiations in New York for liquidation of the tense

                            Telegrams, 1953-1963)</note> I have studied the list and, I must
                        confess, the approach of the American side to this matter has seriously
                        worried me. In such a move, I will say frankly, I see a wish to complicate
                        the situation, because it is impossible indeed to place into the category of
                        “offensive” weapons such types of weapons which have always been referred to
                        as defensive weapons even by a man uneducated militarily—by a common
                        soldier, not to say of an officer.</p>
                    <p>It is hard for us to understand what aim is being pursued by the introduction
                        of that list, by setting forth such a demand—in any case it must be some
                        other aim, but not a desire for a speediest clearing of the <pb n="200"
                            xml:id="pg_200" facs="0222"/>atmosphere. And it is being done at a
                        moment when we have already agreed with you on the main questions and when
                        we on our part have already fulfilled what we agreed upon—have dismantled
                        rocket weapons, are loading them now on ships and these weapons will be soon
                        shipped from Cuba. That is why I feel greatly concerned with the advancing
                        of such demand by the American side, concerned with its possible
                        consequences, if necessary reasonableness is not displayed.</p>
                    <p>The demand which has been set forth is evidently pursuing, as I have already
                        said, some other aims and that—I would wish, Mr. President, that you
                        understand me correctly—can lead not to the betterment of our relations but,
                        on the contrary, to their new aggravation. We should understand the position
                        each side is in and take it into consideration but not overburden, not
                        complicate our relations, especially at such an important moment when
                        measures are being taken to eliminate the acute tension and bring these
                        relations to a normal state.</p>
                    <p>That is why I would ask you, Mr. President, to meet our anxiety with
                        understanding, to take measures on your side in order not to complicate the
                        situation and to give your representatives a directive to eliminate the
                        existing tension on the basis upon which both of us have agreed by having
                        exchanged public messages. You spoke to the effect that missiles which you
                        called offensive should be removed from Cuba. We agreed to that. You in your
                        turn gave assurances that the so-called “quarantine” would be promptly
                        removed and that no invasion of Cuba would be made, not only by the U.S. but
                        by other countries of the Western hemisphere either.</p>
                    <p>Let us then bring the achieved understanding to a completion, so that we
                        could consider that each side has fulfilled its pledges and the question has
                        been settled. If, however, additional demands are made, then that means only
                        one thing—the danger that the difficulties on the way to eliminating tension
                        created around Cuba will not be removed. But that may raise then new
                        consequences.</p>
                    <p>I think that you will understand me correctly. For you and I will evidently
                        have to deal not only with elimination of the remnants of the present
                        tension—there lies ahead for you and me a great, serious talk on other
                        questions. Why then start now complicating the situation by minor things.
                        Maybe there exist some considerations, but they are beyond our
                        comprehension. As for us, we view the introduction of additional demands as
                        a wish to bring our relations back again into a heated state in which they
                        were but several days ago.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Chairman</hi>: I am surprised that in your
                        letter, which I received yesterday, <note n="1" xml:id="d74fn1"><ref
                                target="#d73">Document 73</ref>.</note> you suggest that in giving
                        your representative in New York a list of the weapons we consider offensive
                        there was any desire on our part to complicate the situation. Our intention
                        was just the opposite: to stick to a well-known list, and not to introduce
                        any new factors. But there is really only one major item on the list, beyond
                        the missiles and their equipment, and that is the light bombers with their
                        equipment. This item is indeed of great importance to us.</p>
                    <p>The solution of the Cuban affair was established by my letter to you of
                        October twenty-seventh and your reply of October twenty-eighth.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d74fn2"><ref target="#d67">Documents 67</ref> and <ref
                                target="#d68">68</ref>.</note> You will recall that in my letter of
                        October twenty-seventh, I referred to “all weapons systems in Cuba capable
                        of offensive use.” You will also recall that in my broadcast address of
                        October twenty-second, <note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">See <ref target="#d60fn1"
                                >footnote 1, Document 60</ref>.</note> in addition to medium-range
                        ballistic missiles, I mentioned specifically “jet bombers capable of
                        carrying nuclear weapons,” as “an explicit threat to the peace and security
                        of all the Americas.” Finally, my proclamation of October twenty-third
                        entitled “Interdiction of the Delivery of Offensive Weapons to Cuba”<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d74fn4">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of
                                the Presidents of the United States:<persName corresp="#p_KJF2">John

                        specifically listed bomber aircraft. These facts were all known at the time
                        of our exchange of letters on Cuba, and so it seems clear to me that our
                        exchange of letters covers the IL-28s, since your undertaking was to remove
                        the weapons we described as offensive.</p>
                    <p>Your letter says—and I agree—that we should not complicate the situation by
                        minor things. But I assure you that this matter of IL-28s is not a minor
                        matter for us at all. It is true, of course, that these bombers are not the
                        most modern of weapons, but they are distinctly capable of offensive use
                        against the United States and other Western Hemispheric countries, and I am
                        sure your own military men would inform you that the continued existence of
                        such bombers in Cuba would require substantial measures of military defense
                        in response by the United States. Thus, in simple logic these are weapons
                        capable of offensive use. But there is more in it than that, Mr. Chairman.
                        These bombers could carry nuclear weapons for long distances, and they are
                        clearly not needed, any more <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0224"/>than
                        missiles, for purely defensive purposes on the island of Cuba. Thus in the
                        present context their continued presence would sustain the grave tension
                        that has been created, and their removal, in my view, is necessary to a good
                        start on ending the recent crisis.</p>
                    <p>I am not clear as to what items you object to on the list which Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> handed to
                            Mr.<persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName>. I can assure you I
                        have no desire to cause you difficulties by any wide interpretation of the
                        definitions of weapons which we consider offensive and I am instructing my
                        representative in New York to confer promptly with Mr.<persName
                            corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> and to be as forthcoming as
                        possible in order to meet any legitimate complaints you may have in order to
                        reach a quick solution which would enable our agreement to be carried to
                        completion. I entirely agree with your statement that we should wind up the
                        immediate crisis promptly, and I assure you that on our side we are
                        insisting only on what is immediately essential for progress in this matter.
                        In order to make our position clear, I think I should go on to give you a
                        full sense of the very strong feelings we have about this whole affair here
                        in the United States.</p>
                    <p>These recent events have given a profound shock to relations between our two
                        countries. It may be said, as Mr.<persName corresp="#p_KVV2"
                            >Kuznetsov</persName> said the other day to Mr.<persName
                            corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>, that the Soviet Union was under no
                        obligation to inform us of any activities it was carrying on in a third
                        country. I cannot accept this view; not only did this action threaten the
                        whole safety of this hemisphere, but it was, in a broader sense, a dangerous
                        attempt to change the world-wide status quo. Secret action of this kind
                        seems to me both hazardous and unjustified. But however one may judge that
                        argument, what actually happened in this case was not simply that the action
                        of your side was secret. Your Government repeatedly gave us assurances of
                        what it was not doing; these assurances were announced as coming from the
                        highest levels, and they proved inaccurate.</p>
                    <p>I do not refer here only to the <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> article
                        of September, but also to communications which were addressed to the highest
                        levels of our Government through channels which heretofore had been used for
                        confidential messages from the highest levels of your Government. Through
                        these channels we were specifically informed that no missiles would be
                        placed in Cuba which would have a range capable of reaching the United
                        States. In reliance upon these assurances I attempted, as you know, to
                        restrain those who were giving warnings in this country about the trend of
                        events in Cuba. Thus undeniable photographic evidence that offensive weapons
                        were being installed was a deep and dangerous shock, first to this
                        Government and then to our whole people.</p>
                    <p>In the aftermath of this shock, to which we replied with a measured but
                        necessary response, I believe it is vital that we should re-establish some
                        degree of confidence in communication between the two of us. If the leaders
                        of the two great nuclear powers cannot judge with some accuracy <pb n="203"
                            xml:id="pg_203" facs="0225"/>the intentions of each other, we shall find
                        ourselves in a period of gravely increasing danger—not only for our two
                        countries but for the whole world.</p>
                    <p>I therefore hope that you will promptly recognize that when we speak of the
                        need to remove missiles and bombers, with their immediate supporting
                        equipment, we are not trying to complicate the situation but simply stating
                        what was clearly included in our understanding of October twenty-seventh and
                        twenty-eighth. I shall continue to abide fully by the undertakings in my
                        letter of October twenty-seventh, and specifically, under the conditions
                        stated in that letter I will hold to my undertaking “to give assurances
                        against an invasion of Cuba.” This undertaking has already come under attack
                        here and is likely to become increasingly an object of criticism by a great
                        many of my countrymen. And the very minimum that is necessary in regard to
                        these assurances is, as we agreed, the verified removal of the missile and
                        bomber systems, together with real safeguards against their
                        reintroduction.</p>
                    <p>I should emphasize to you directly, Mr. Chairman, that in this respect there
                        is another problem immediately ahead of us which could become very serious
                        indeed, and that is the problem of continuing verification in Cuba. Your
                        representatives have spoken as if this were entirely a problem for the
                            <persName corresp="#p_CRF1">Castro</persName> regime to settle, but the
                        continuing verification of the absence of offensive weapons in Cuba is an
                        essential safeguard for the United States and the other countries of this
                        hemisphere, and is an explicit condition for the undertakings which we in
                        our turn have agreed to. The need for this verification is, I regret to say,
                        convincingly demonstrated by what happened in Cuba in the months of
                        September and October.</p>
                    <p>For the present we are having to rely on our own methods of surveillance, and
                        this surveillance will surely have to be continued unless, as we much
                        prefer, a better and durable method can be found. We believe that it is a
                        serious responsibility of your Government to insure that weapons which you
                        have provided to Cuba are not employed to interfere with this surveillance
                        which is so important to us all in obtaining reliable information on which
                        improvements in the situation can be based. It was of great importance, for
                        example, for me last week to be able to announce with confidence that
                        dismantling of missiles had begun.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I would like to say a word about longer range matters. I think we
                        must both recognize that it will be very difficult for any of us in this
                        hemisphere to look forward to any real improvement in our relations with
                        Cuba if it continues to be a military outpost of the Soviet Union. We have
                        limited our action at present to the problem of offensive weapons, but I do
                        think it may be important for you to consider whether a real normalization
                        of the Cuba problem can be envisaged while there remains in Cuba large
                        numbers of Soviet military technicians, and major weapons <pb n="204"
                            xml:id="pg_204" facs="0226"/>systems and communications complexes under
                        Soviet control, all with the recurrent possibility that offensive weapons
                        might be secretly and rapidly reintroduced. That is why I think there is
                        much wisdom in the conclusion expressed in your letter of October 26th, that
                        when our undertakings against invasion are effective the need for your
                        military specialists in Cuba will disappear. That is the real path to
                        progress in the Cuban problem. And in this connection in particular, I hope
                        you will understand that we must attach the greatest importance to the
                        personal assurances you have given that submarine bases will not be
                        established in Cuba.</p>
                    <p>I believe that Cuba can never have normal relations with the other nations of
                        this hemisphere unless it ceases to appear to be a foreign military base and
                        adopts a peaceful course of non-interference in the affairs of its sister
                        nations. These wider considerations may belong to a later phase of the
                        problem, but I hope that you will give them careful thought.</p>
                    <p>In the immediate situation, however, I repeat that it is the withdrawal of
                        the missiles and bombers, with their supporting equipment, under adequate
                        verification, and with a proper system for continued safeguards in the
                        future, that is essential. This is the first necessary step away from the
                        crisis to open the door through which we can move to restore confidence and
                        give attention to other problems which ought to be resolved in the interest
                        of peace.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>, I would like to express my
                        satisfaction that the mutual obligations taken in accordance with the
                        exchange of messages <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0227"/>between us are
                        being carried out both by your side and our side. One can say that certain
                        favourable results are already seen at this time. We appreciate your
                        understanding of the situation and your cooperation in carrying out the
                        obligations taken by our side. We, on our part, will as always honor our
                        obligations. And I would like to inform you that our obligations with regard
                        to dismantling and removal of both missiles and warheads have already been
                        fulfilled.</p>
                    <p>We appreciate that we have come to an agreement with you regarding the
                        mutually acceptable means for your side to ascertain that we really carry
                        out our obligations. What has already been achieved in the course of
                        negotiations between our representatives—<persName corresp="#p_KVV2"
                            >Kuznetsov</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName>—and the cooperation
                        reached in the process of these negotiations is a good thing. The same
                        should be said about the cooperation between captains of our ships, which
                        were taking our missiles from Cuba, and corresponding U.S. ships. This is
                        very good, this has created an impression that your side also wishes to
                        cooperate in eliminating the remnants of the tension which only yesterday
                        was very dangerous both for our two peoples and for the peoples of the whole
                        world.</p>
                    <p>Thus, if we proceed from our understanding which was expressed in your
                        message of October 27 and in our reply of October 28, <note n="1"
                            xml:id="d75fn1"><ref target="#d67">Documents 67</ref> and <ref
                                target="#d68">68</ref>.</note> then we, the Soviet side, have
                        carried out our obligations and thereby have created possibility for
                        complete elimination of tension in the Caribbean. Consequently, now it is
                        your turn, it is for your side to carry out precisely your obligations. We
                        have in mind that apart from the long term obligations that the United
                        States itself will not attack Cuba and will restrain other countries of the
                        Western Hemisphere from doing that, the most important thing which is
                        required today is to give moral satisfaction to world public opinion and
                        tranquillity to peoples. And what is required from your side to that end is
                        to lift the so-called quarantine and of course to stop violating the
                        territorial waters and air space of Cuba. If this continues confidence in
                        your obligations will thus be undermined which can only grieve world public
                        and throw us back to the positions to which we must not return after the
                        liquidation of such a dangerous situation. To say nothing of the fact that
                        it would hamper us in the future.</p>
                    <p>At present, we must—and we are convinced in that—look forward and draw
                        necessary conclusions from what has happened up till now and from the good
                        which followed due to the efforts of both sides. Therefore, we believe that
                        conditions are emerging now for reaching an agreement on the prohibition of
                        nuclear weapons, cessation of all types of nuclear weapon tests and on all
                        other questions which are ripe and require solution. You have already ended
                        your tests and we shall probably also end our tests in November or at least
                        before the end of this year.</p>
                    <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0228"/>
                    <p>Now it is also necessary to think of some real measures with regard to the
                        question of ensuring more stable security in the world. In this connection
                        we attach great importance to your statement that the US is ready to support
                        idea of a non-aggression pact between <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        and the Warsaw treaty countries. But the basic question, of course, remains
                        that of disarmament, of destroying the whole war machine of states. To give
                        more assurance on the first stage it might be expedient to return to the
                        proposals forwarded by us some time ago on the establishment of observation
                        posts on mutual basis at airfields, in major seaports, at railway junctions,
                        on highways. This would exclude a possibility of a surprise attack if any
                        side does not behave honestly, if it wants to concentrate military equipment
                        and its troops for an attack. Precisely this is pursued by the suggestion
                        made recently by Mr. Thant.</p>
                    <p>It goes without saying that the question of a German peace treaty still
                        remains and we can not escape from solving it. Moreover what we and you have
                        lived through makes a speediest solution of this question still more
                        imperative.</p>
                    <p>I do not name other unresolved questions, we have plenty of them, I name only
                        the main problems, on the solution of which the destinies of the world
                        largely depend.</p>
                    <p>Now about the matter that, as you state, worries you today—about the IL-28
                        planes which you call an offensive weapon. We have already given you our
                        clarification on this point and I think you can not but agree with us.
                        However, if you do not agree—and this is your right—ask your intelligence
                        after all and let it give you an answer based not on guesswork but on facts.
                        If it really knows anything it must tell you the truth and namely that it is
                        long since the IL-28’s have been taken out of production and out of use in
                        our armed forces. And if some planes still remain now—and a certain number
                        of them have been brought by us to Cuba—that was done as a result of your
                        action last year when you increased the budget and called up reservists. We
                        on our part had to take measures in response at that time, having postponed
                        taking those planes out of use as well.</p>
                    <p>Had there been no such action on your part we would not have IL-28’s in
                        existence because they would have been used for scrap. Such is this
                        “formidable offensive” weapon. If your intelligence is objective it must
                        give a correct appraisal of these 12-year old planes and report to you that
                        they are incapable of offensive actions. We brought them to Cuba only
                        because they can be used as a mobile means of coastal defense under the
                        cover of anti-aircraft fire from their own territory. They can not however
                        fly beyond the limits of that cover since they will be immediately destroyed
                        either by modern anti-aircraft means or by simple conventional artillery;
                        not to speak of interceptors before which they are <pb n="207"
                            xml:id="pg_207" facs="0229"/>entirely defenseless. But all this must be
                        known not only to the intelligence but to all engaged in military
                        matters.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless we regard your concern with understanding though on our part we
                        share the desire of the Government of Cuba to possess defensive weapons
                        which would permit to defend the territorial integrity of its country.</p>
                    <p>Therefore if you met this with understanding and if we agreed with you on
                        solving other questions in implementing the mutually assumed obligations
                        then the question of IL-28 bombers would be solved without difficulties.</p>
                    <p>In what way should this cooperation, in our understanding, find its
                        expression and what would facilitate the solution of this question?</p>
                    <p>We state to you that these bombers are piloted solely by our fliers.
                        Consequently you should not have any fears that they can be used to do harm
                        to the United States or other neighbouring countries in Western Hemisphere.
                        And since you and your allies in Western Hemisphere have taken an obligation
                        not to invade Cuba then it would seem this weapon should not pose any threat
                        for you. Moreover, we are aware of what military means are in your
                        possession. If the enemy were threatening us with such weapon we would
                        ignore that threat completely for it would cause us no anxiety
                        whatsoever.</p>
                    <p>But because you express apprehension that this weapon can be some sort of
                        threat to the US or other countries of Western Hemisphere which do not
                        possess adequate defensive means we state to you as a guarantee that those
                        planes are piloted by our fliers and therefore there should be no misgivings
                        that they could be used to the detriment of any state.</p>
                    <p>As you ascertained yourself we have removed the missiles, we also removed
                        everything else related to missiles, all the equipment necessary for their
                        use and recalled the personnel manning those missiles. Now that the missiles
                        are removed the question of IL-28’s is an incomprehensible argument because
                        that weapon as I have already said is of no value as a combat weapon at
                        present, to say nothing of the future. Let us come to an agreement on this
                        question as well, let us do away with tension, let us fulfil the mutual
                        pledges made in our messages. We will not insist on permanently keeping
                        those planes on Cuba. We have our difficulties in this question. Therefore
                        we give a gentleman’s word that we will remove the IL-28 planes with all the
                        personnel and equipment related to those planes, although not now but later.
                        We would like to do that some time later when we determine that the
                        conditions are ripe to remove them. We will advise you of that.</p>
                    <p>I think that an agreement on such basis will enable us to complete the
                        elimination of all the tension that existed and will create conditions for
                        life to resume its normal course, that is the blockade would be immediately
                            <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0230"/>removed; the pledges of the
                        sides would be registered in the appropriate documents in the United Nations
                        Organization; non-invasion of Cuba and strict observance of her sovereignty
                        guaranteed; the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> posts established in the
                        countries of the Caribbean so that neither one nor the other side would
                        indeed undertake any unexpected actions to the detriment of another
                        state.</p>
                    <p>This would be the best solution which can be anticipated especially having in
                        mind the tension that we lived through and the abyss we came to. And I
                        believe, Mr. President, that you yourself understand that we were very close
                        to that abyss. But you and we soberly and wisely appraised the situation and
                        maintained self-control. Let us now give a complete satisfaction to the
                        public.</p>
                    <p>What happened should now prompt us to make new great efforts so that no
                        repetition of such events should be allowed because if we succeeded in
                        finding a way out of a dangerous situation this time, next time we might not
                        safely untie the tightly made knot. And the knot that we are now untying has
                        been tied rather tightly, almost to the limit.</p>
                    <p>We displayed an understanding with regard to the positions of each other and
                        came out of a critical situation through mutual concessions to the
                        satisfaction of all peoples of the world. Let us now give joy to all peoples
                        of the world and show that this conflict really became a matter of
                        yesterday, let us normalize the situation. And it would be good if on your
                        part efforts were made to make the normalization a complete, real
                        normalization and it is necessary to do this in the interests of all peoples
                        and this is within our power.</p>

                                        shall be withdrawn within a certain period of time.
                                        Following this agreement the US will immediately, even

                    <p>I have read with great satisfaction the reply of the President of the United
                        States <note n="1" xml:id="d77fn1">Apparent reference to <ref target="#d74"
                                >Document 74</ref>.</note> and I agree with the considerations
                        expressed by the <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0232"/>President. It is
                        of particular pleasure to me that we seem to have the same desire to
                        liquidate as soon as possible the state of tension and normalize the
                        situation so that to untie our hands for normal work and for solving those
                        questions that are awaiting their solution. And this depends in the main on
                        agreement between us—the two greatest powers in the world with whom special
                        responsibility for ensuring peace lies to a greater degree than with other
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>The question of the withdrawal of the IL-28’s within mentioned 30 days does
                        not constitute any complicated question. Yet this period will probably not
                        be sufficient. As I already said in my oral message <note n="2"
                            xml:id="d77fn2"><ref target="#d75">Document 75</ref>.</note> I can
                        assure the President that those planes will be removed from Cuba with all
                        the equipment and flying personnel. It can be done in 2-3 months. But for
                        me, for our country it would be a great relief if the state of tension that
                        evolved in the Caribbean were liquidated as soon as possible. I have in mind
                        what I have already said, namely: to lift immediately the quarantine that is
                        blockade; to stop the flights of the US planes over Cuba; to write down the
                        mutual commitments ensuing from the messages of the President and mine of
                        October 27 and 28 <note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3"><ref target="#d67">Documents
                                67</ref> and <ref target="#d68">68</ref>.</note> to which end your
                        representatives and ours have to prepare with the participation of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Acting Secretary General U Thant an
                        appropriate document. This is the main thing now.</p>
                    <p>You understand that when we say that it is necessary to announce now the
                        withdrawal of the IL-28’s at the time when your planes are flying over Cuba
                        it creates for us no small difficulties. I have no doubt that you will
                        understand—and the Cuban Government understands this—that such actions
                        constitute violation of sovereignty of the Cuban state. Therefore it would
                        be a reasonable step to create in this respect also conditions for the
                        normalization of the situation and this in a great degree would make it
                        easier to meet your wish of expediting the withdrawal of the IL-28 planes
                        from Cuba.</p>
                    <p>If we attain all that now and if this were announced, then more favourable
                        conditions would be created for our country to solve the question of
                        timetable for the withdrawal of IL-28 planes.</p>
                    <p>Now our main difficulties lie precisely in the fact that, as it is well known
                        to everybody and it is being rightfully pointed out to us, we have removed
                        from Cuba missiles and warheads, that is, we have fulfilled our commitments
                        while the US is not carrying out its commitments—the quarantine continues,
                        the US planes continue to fly over Cuba and there is no agreement that would
                        register the pledges of the US. And all this finds ears that are listening
                        and listening attentively. It is difficult for us to give explanations to
                        such unjustifiable state of affairs. Therefore to <pb n="211"
                            xml:id="pg_211" facs="0233"/>carry out the final procedure after the
                        missiles and warheads have been removed, already now the quarantine must be
                        lifted, the flights of the American planes over Cuba must be stopped and
                        mutual commitments of the sides must be written down in an appropriate
                        document with the participation of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                        >UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>It is hard to say for me what specific agreement is possible on the question
                        of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observation posts. But we as well as
                        the Government of Cuba have already expressed a desire to come to terms on
                        this question. If the question of the observation posts is of interest to
                        the US—and I think it must be of interest—then I consider it wise to come to
                        an agreement on this. I think that the Government of Cuba will not object to
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> posts, of course on the condition of
                        respect for the sovereignty of Cuba, on the condition of treating her as
                        equal which must mean that on the territory of other countries of the
                        Caribbean and in a corresponding region of the US there will be also set up
                        similar <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> posts, that is on the condition
                        that reciprocity will be observed in this question.</p>
                    <p>You understand, Mr. President, that no country can assume unilateral
                        commitments, and it would be wise to make them mutual.</p>
                    <p>I have already said that perhaps it will be necessary for us in the
                        negotiations on disarmament between our countries at the first stage to
                        return to our proposals providing for the establishment of posts at
                        airfields, in major sea-ports, at railway junctions, on highways in order to
                        give guarantees to all the countries of the world that no country will be
                        able to secretly concentrate troops and get prepared for an attack against
                        or invasion of another country. It is wise, it appeals to us.</p>
                    <p>If you would give your representatives—<persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1"
                            >McCloy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName>
                        and others—appropriate instructions on the question of <gloss

                        regions of the US—and our representatives have such instructions—and if they
                        would come to an agreement then all this could be made public. Then there
                        would be removed the difficulties connected with making a public
                        announcement on the withdrawal of IL-28 planes and we would name then
                        specific dates. These dates will be probably much closer than those which I
                        name and maybe even closer than those which were named by you.</p>
                    <p>That is why we should make a final step in this direction. Then we would
                        really cut the knot which was tied tightly enough and having cut it we would
                        create normal relations between our countries to which our people aspire and
                        which your people, we are sure of that, also want.</p>
                    <p>I will allow myself to express some other considerations and I believe you
                        will not take offence and will not consider that I intrude too much into the
                        sphere of your internal affairs. Voting in the elections to the Senate, the
                        House of Representatives and in gubernatorial elections which just took
                        place has resulted in the defeat of your former rival who was clearly
                        preparing for the next presidential elections. It is significant <pb n="212"
                            xml:id="pg_212" facs="0234"/>that as a result of the elections precisely
                        those candidates were defeated who, if I may use such an expression, were
                        making most frenzied bellicose speeches.</p>
                    <p>This indicates that the American people already begin to feel that if the
                        arms race continues further, if a reasonable solution is not found and an
                        understanding is not achieved between our countries then our peoples will
                        feel still more strongly the threat of the dreadful catastrophe of a
                        thermonuclear war.</p>
                    <p>Let us then not keep people of peace all over the world in suspense, let us
                        give them joyous satisfaction. Having cut the knot in the Caribbean we would
                        thereby immediately create better conditions and would reinforce
                        peoples’hope for coping with other questions which are now awaiting their
                        solution. Peoples expect wisdom from us, first of all from our two states.
                        Of course our two states can not do everything, but all that depends on us
                        in the sense of reaching an understanding will be of decisive importance.
                        Needless to prove that other states would be also satisfied. And he who was
                        especially displeased will have to agree after this understanding is reached
                        that there is no other way, that the way to peace is the wisest and the only
                        way of meeting the aspirations of all states, all peoples.</p>

                    <p>I am glad to learn of your assurance of agreement that the IL-28s should be
                            withdrawn.<note n="1" xml:id="d78fn1">See <ref target="#d77">Document

                        timing.</p>
                    <p>Let me review the undertakings in my letter of October twenty-seventh and
                        your letter of October twenty-eighth.<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2"><ref
                                target="#d67">Documents 67</ref> and <ref target="#d68"
                            >68</ref>.</note> You agreed to remove the <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213"
                            facs="0235"/>weapons systems we described as offensive and with suitable
                        safeguards to halt the further introduction of such weapons into Cuba. On
                        our side, we undertook to agree to remove the quarantine measures in effect
                        and to give assurances against an invasion of Cuba. There were two
                        conditions attached to our undertaking. The first was that the weapons
                        systems would be removed “under appropriate United Nations observation and
                        supervision,” and, second, that there would be established “adequate
                        arrangements through the United Nations to ensure the carrying out and
                        continuation of these commitments.”</p>
                    <p>I cannot agree with your statement that you have fulfilled your commitments
                        and that we have not fulfilled ours. Let us recall what, in fact, has
                        occurred. You have removed a certain number of missiles from Cuba—not under
                        United Nations supervision—but you did cooperate in arrangements which
                        enabled us to be reasonably sure that forty-two missiles were in fact taken
                        out of Cuba. There has been no United Nations verification that other
                        missiles were not left behind and, in fact, there have been many reports of
                        their being concealed in caves and elsewhere, and we have no way of
                        satisfying those who are concerned about these reports. The IL-28’s are
                        still in Cuba and are of deep concern to the people of our entire
                        Hemisphere. Thus, three major parts of the undertakings on your side—the
                        removal of the IL-28’s, the arrangements for verification, and safeguards
                        against introduction—have not yet been carried out.</p>
                    <p>We suppose that part of the trouble here may be in Cuba. The Secretary
                        General of the United Nations was not allowed to make arrangements for the
                        experts he took with him to Cuba to verify removal of the offensive weapons;
                        the Cuban Government did not agree to International Red Cross inspection at
                        ports; they have refused the Secretary General’s suggestion that the Latin
                        American Ambassadors in Havana undertake this verification; they have
                        rejected a further suggestion of the Secretary General concerning the use of
                        various non-aligned Chiefs of Mission in Havana for this purpose. It is
                        difficult for me to understand why the Cubans are so resistant to the series
                        of reasonable proposals that have been made to them by U Thant unless, for
                        reasons of their own, they are determined to see the crisis prolonged and
                        worsened. We both have means of influencing the Cuban government and I do
                        not believe that we can allow that government to frustrate the clear
                        understandings our two governments have reached in the interests of
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>In these circumstances we have so far been patient and careful, as we have
                        been, indeed, at every stage. As you know from your own reports, we have
                        always applied the quarantine with care and with regard for the position of
                        others, and in recent days we have relied on the oral assurances of the
                        masters of your ships and other ships. Moreover I myself held back orders
                        for more forceful action right to the limit of possibility <pb n="214"
                            xml:id="pg_214" facs="0236"/>during the week of October 27th and 28th.
                        But we cannot make progress from here—or avoid a return of danger to this
                        situation—if your side now should fall into the mistake of claiming that it
                        has met all its commitments, and refusing to help with the real business of
                        carrying out our purpose of untying the Cuban knot.</p>
                    <p>What, in these circumstances, should be done? We are entitled to insist on
                        removal of the IL-28’s and on safeguards against reintroduction of offensive
                        weapons before we lift the quarantine or give assurances of any sort. But we
                        are interested in making rapid progress, step-by-step, and that is why we
                        have proposed an arrangement more favorable from your standpoint: that as
                        soon as you give the order for the removal of the IL-28’s and their men and
                        equipment, to be completed within thirty days, (and I am glad you say the
                        length of time is not the real problem) we will announce the lifting of the
                        quarantine. That is more than we agreed to on October twenty-seventh and
                        twenty-eighth, but we wish to end this crisis promptly.</p>
                    <p>Beyond that, we are quite willing to instruct our negotiators in New York to
                        work closely with yours in order to reach agreement on other matters
                        affecting this problem. We believe, again, that these matters should follow
                        the removal of offensive weapons systems, but just as we have been able to
                        discuss other matters while a number of missiles were leaving, we believe
                        the urgently needed talks can and should go forward while the bombers are
                        leaving. We do not insist that everything wait its exact turn—but only that
                        the essential first steps be clearly going forward.</p>
                    <p>But what is most urgent, after we can agree that offensive weapons are
                        leaving, and after the quarantine is lifted, is to make some real progress
                        on continuing observations and verification. It will be essential to have
                        such arrangements—and this again is clear in the letters of October 27 and
                        28—before our assurances can be more formally stated. Our undertaking on
                        this point remains firm and clear, and we want nothing better than to be
                        able to give our assurances, just as we said we would, when the necessary
                        conditions exist.</p>
                    <p>In the absence of any arrangements under the United Nations or otherwise for
                        international verification or safeguards, we have of course been obliged to
                        rely upon our own resources for surveillance of the situation in Cuba,
                        although this course is unsatisfactory. Just today we learned of new threats
                        by <persName corresp="#p_CRF1">Castro</persName> against this necessary
                        surveillance. I should make it very clear that if there is any interference
                        with this surveillance, we shall have to take the necessary action in reply,
                        and it is for just this reason that it is so urgent to obtain better
                        safeguards.</p>
                    <p>We note with interest that in your last message the arrangement of
                        observation and verification is enlarged from Cuba to include certain other
                        areas. This is a substantial change from the terms of our exchange <pb
                            n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0237"/>of messages, and as we see it any
                        such wider arrangements would necessarily require careful discussion. For
                        example, if we move outside Cuba to observe what is happening in other
                        countries which have been involved in the recent tensions, there might have
                        to be observation posts at the appropriate ports in the Soviet Union from
                        which weapons could be shipped to Cuba, as well as in appropriate places in
                        the United States. This is a matter which deserves close study and it may
                        offer a chance of real progress in the long run, but for the immediate
                        future it seems to us better to work within the framework of our
                        understanding of October 27 and 28.</p>
                    <p>We also think that Brazilian proposal for a verified Denuclearized Zone in
                        Latin America <note n="3" xml:id="d78fn3">Draft U.N. Resolution A/C.1/L.312.
                            A revised version of it, U.N. doc. A/C.1/L.312/Rev.2, was submitted to
                            the First Committee of the United Nations by Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, and
                            Ecuador on November 15. For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on
                                Disarmament, 1962</hi>, vol. II, pp. 1056-1057.</note> could, with
                        the cooperation of Cuba and if acceptable to the other Latin American
                        countries, in the long run offer an acceptable means for a broader approach.
                        However, the immediate problem is, I repeat, the carrying out of our
                        understanding with regard to verification that offensive weapons have in
                        fact been removed from Cuba and the establishing of safeguards against their
                        reintroduction pending the coming into effect of longer-term arrangements.
                        Even apart from our understanding, given the history of this matter, I am
                        sure, Mr. Chairman, that you can understand that this is a real necessity if
                        we are to move to the settlement of other matters.</p>
                    <p>But the first step is to get the bombers started out, and the quarantine
                        lifted—for both are sources of tension. Meanwhile discussion can continue on
                        other aspects of the problem.</p>

                            xml:id="pg_216" facs="0238"/>statement that the United States is also
                        interested in the achievement of a rapid progress in untying the Cuban knot.
                        This is our great desire too. It is good that you have confirmed once again
                        that the U.S. commitment to give assurance of non-invasion of Cuba, which
                        was agreed upon in the exchange of messages on October 27 and 28 <note n="2"
                            xml:id="d79fn2"><ref target="#d67">Documents 67</ref> and <ref
                                target="#d68">68</ref>.</note> remains firm and clear. I fully share
                        also the thought expressed by you about the necessity to act with caution,
                        to take into consideration the position of others. Now when we speak of
                        eliminating the remnants of the crisis this is as important as at any of its
                        past stages.</p>
                    <p>I always believed and believe now that both of us are guided by the
                        realization of the immense responsibility for the peaceful settlement of the
                        crisis over Cuba being completed. The basis for such settlement already
                        exists: the sides have achieved an agreement and have taken upon themselves
                        certain obligations. It is precisely where we proceed from.</p>
                    <p>What have we agreed upon? In brief our agreement has come to the
                        following.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union removes from Cuba rocket weapons which you called offensive
                        and gives a possibility to ascertain this. The United States of America
                        promptly removes the quarantine and gives assurances that there will be no
                        invasion of Cuba, not only by the US but also by other countries of the
                        Western Hemisphere. This is the essence of our agreement.</p>
                    <p>Later on you raised the question of removal of IL-28 planes from Cuba. I
                        think you could not but feel the precariousness of that request. Now, of
                        course, there may appear those who would wish to rummage in the wordings and
                        to interpret them in different ways. But you and we do know well what kind
                        of weapons they were that set the forest on fire, they were missiles. It was
                        not accidental, indeed, that in our and your messages of October 27 and 28
                        there was not a single mention of bomber planes and specifically of IL-28’s.
                        At the same time those messages have direct reference to rocket weapons.</p>
                    <p>By the way, you yourself refer not to direct obligations of the sides but to
                        the understanding implied by the American side in the expression “offensive
                        weapons” mentioned in the messages and in this connection you recall your TV
                        address of October 22 and your proclamation of October 23.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d79fn3">Regarding the President’s October 22 address, see

                        agree, Mr. President, that messages that fix the subject of agreement and
                        unilateral statements of the U.S. Government are two different things
                        indeed.</p>
                    <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0239"/>
                    <p>I informed you that the IL-28 planes are twelve years old and by their combat
                        characteristics they at present cannot be classified as offensive types of
                        weapons. In spite of all this, we regarded your request with understanding.
                        We took into consideration that you made certain statements and therefore
                        the question of removal of IL-28 planes assumed for you as President a
                        certain significance and probably created certain difficulties. We grant it.
                        Since you might really have your difficulties in this question we moved in
                        your direction having informed you of our consent to remove these planes
                        from Cuba. What is the situation now if to summarize it in short and to
                        speak of the main?</p>
                    <p>We have dismantled and removed from Cuba all the medium range ballistic
                        missiles to the last with nuclear warheads for them. All the nuclear weapons
                        have been taken away from Cuba. The Soviet personnel who were servicing the
                        rocket installations have also been withdrawn. We have stated it to your
                        representatives at the negotiations in New York too.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. Government was afforded the possibility to ascertain the fact that
                        all 42 missiles that were in Cuba have really been removed.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, we expressed our readiness to remove also the IL-28 planes from
                        Cuba. I inform you that we intend to remove them within a month term and may
                        be even sooner since the term for the removal of these planes is not a
                        matter of principle for us. We are prepared to remove simultaneously with
                        the IL-28 planes all the Soviet personnel connected with the servicing of
                        these planes.</p>
                    <p>What can be said in connection with the commitments of the American side?
                        Proper consideration through the U.N. of the commitment not to invade
                        Cuba—and it is the main commitment of your side—so far is being delayed. The
                        quarantine has not been lifted as yet. Permit me to express the hope that
                        with receipt of this communication of mine you will issue instructions to
                        the effect that the quarantine be lifted immediately with the withdrawal of
                        your naval and other military units from the Caribbean area.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, your planes still continue to fly over the Cuban territory. It
                        does not normalize the situation but aggravates it. And all this is taking
                        place at the time when we have removed the missiles from Cuba, have given
                        you the possibility to ascertain it through appropriate observation and when
                        we declare our intention to remove the IL-28 planes from Cuba.</p>
                    <p>I will not conceal that lately I have to hear more and more often that we are
                        too trustful with regard to the statements of the U.S. readiness to carry
                        out its part of the agreement on Cuba and that the American side will under
                        various pretexts evade the fulfilment of the obligations which it assumed. I
                        do not want to believe this and I proceed from something different: the
                        President has given his word and he will keep it as well as <pb n="218"
                            xml:id="pg_218" facs="0240"/>we keep our word. But in such an acute and
                        delicate question which we face there cannot but exist the limits beyond
                        which the trust begins losing its value if it is not being strengthened with
                        practical steps towards each other. All this should be mutually taken into
                        consideration to sooner crown with success our efforts in settling the
                        conflict.</p>
                    <p>I understand, of course, that some time is needed to formalize through the
                        U.N. the agreement on the settlement of the conflict in the Caribbean area,
                        including commitments of non-invasion of Cuba. But this time should be
                        measured by days, not by weeks and, of course, not by months.</p>
                    <p>Of all the commitments based on the agreement achieved between us in the
                        course of the exchange of messages you declare of your readiness to remove
                        the quarantine immediately as soon as we agree on the term for the removal
                        of IL-28’s, without waiting for their removal.</p>
                    <p>Moving in your direction and taking the decision on the removal of IL-28
                        planes from Cuba, we presume that we have grounds to count on similar
                        understanding on your part also in the questions of the flights of American
                        planes over Cuba and in promptest formalizing through the U.N. of the U.S.
                        commitments.</p>
                    <p>As for the discontinuance of flights of American planes over Cuba you
                        yourself can see better how this should be done. In my opinion, actual
                        discontinuance of such flights over Cuba would already be a major step
                        forward and would bring about a great easing in the situation, the more so
                        that our missiles have been removed and your side has ascertained this.</p>
                    <p>They say that so far as it is a matter of formalizing the commitments through
                        the U.N. it is difficult for the American side to accept the form of a
                        protocol we are suggesting in which the commitments of the sides are to be
                        fixed. We do not attach decisive significance to a form. Other forms are not
                        excluded either. For instance, a declaration (or declarations) which would
                        be confirmed by the U.N. It is the contents of the document which is
                        important and also that the commitments of the sides be formalized through
                        the U.N. without delay.</p>
                    <p>I heard that Americans have a rule: in any business each side should approach
                        with the same standard the fulfilment of both its own obligations and the
                        obligations of its counterpart and not use “double standard”—one for itself
                        and another for the others. This is a good rule and if it is observed this
                        promises a prompt settlement of the Cuban conflict. Let us follow this good
                        American rule.</p>
                    <p>Now about the conditions which you set forth with regard to carrying out the
                        verification and measures of further observation.</p>
                    <p>Yes, we really agreed to the effect that U.N. representatives could ascertain
                        the removal from Cuba of rocket weapons which you called offensive. But we
                        stipulated however that this question can be solved only <pb n="219"
                            xml:id="pg_219" facs="0241"/>with the consent of the Government of Cuba.
                        We could not take an obligation for the Government of Cuba and your
                        reference, Mr. President, that we allegedly took such an obligation, of
                        course, does not reflect the real situation. I believe that you see for
                        yourself the weakness of such a reference.</p>
                    <p>But what is the main thing in connection with the question of verification
                        with regard to the missiles removed by us that is evaded in your
                        communication? The main thing is that under agreement with you we gave you
                        the possibility to carry out verification of the removal of our rockets in
                        the open sea. We did that and that was an act of goodwill on our part. You
                        will agree that we took this step in the circumstances when no promise had
                        been made by us with regard to this matter in our messages. We did something
                        more in comparison with what had been said by us in the message with regard
                        to verification.</p>
                    <p>It is clear that the said verification of the removal of the missiles
                        conducted in accordance with the arrangement between us substitutes the
                        verification of which you spoke in your message and I would say, in a more
                        effective form at that, because the American side was observing the missiles
                        we were shipping out, so to say, at the final stage of their removal. While
                        even verification of the dismantling would mean observing only the first
                        stage of their removal from Cuba.</p>
                    <p>As a result the American side, as it itself so declared, had every
                        opportunity to count the missiles put on our ships, to photograph them and
                        to ascertain their removal.</p>
                    <p>Thus a way out was found and not a bad one, and the question of the
                        verification must, of course, belong to the past. Now no one can doubt that
                        we have carried out our commitment with regard to the dismantling and
                        shipping of the missiles from Cuba which were a subject in our
                        correspondence. The fact of the removal of those missiles has been
                        officially confirmed also by the U.S. Department of Defense.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d79fn4">For text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy:
                                Current Documents, 1962</hi>, p. 458.</note></p>
                    <p>As for the rumours alleging that the missiles may have been left in Cuba
                        somewhere in the caves, one can say that we do not live in the cave-man age
                        to attach great significance to the rumours of this sort. If someone is
                        spreading rumours of this kind he is doing that deliberately to create
                        difficulties in the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>As far as the question of the American side ascertaining our removing the
                        IL-28 planes from Cuba is concerned, we do not see any problem here. In this
                        respect you and we have the paved way and let us take that way. We have no
                        objections against applying also to this case the procedure agreed upon
                        between us for observation of the removal of the missiles though, speaking
                        frankly, one could do without it. But if you want <pb n="220"
                            xml:id="pg_220" facs="0242"/>your naval vessels and helicopters to spend
                        several hundred tons of fuel sailing and somersaulting around our ships
                        carrying the IL-28 planes, let us then consider that such possibility
                        exists.</p>
                    <p>I will tell you frankly that it was part of our plans, and we believe that we
                        will do it at a proper time, to ship out of Cuba those groups of our
                        military personnel which although were not directly involved in servicing
                        the rocket weapons now removed, still had something to do with guarding
                        those installations. We will do this upon the arrival of our ships. But I
                        must say that the strength of those groups in Cuba is not significant.</p>
                    <p>You raise the question as to what to do next, how to ensure that those types
                        of weapons on the removal of which we have agreed are not brought back to
                        Cuba. I believe that with respect to non-introduction of such weapons in the
                        future you and I do not have any differences. We are prepared to give firm
                        assurances with regard to this matter.</p>
                    <p>However, you speak not only about this. You now want some permanent
                        supervision to be established, in Cuba or over Cuba. But where was it taken
                        from that we gave our consent to permanent supervision? The question has
                        never been put that way in the exchange of messages. And generally, how one
                        can take as a normal thing an establishment, and without any reciprocity at
                        that, of some permanent supervision over a sovereign state?</p>
                    <p>If we are to show serious concern that no unexpected steps are taken on
                        either side to the detriment of each other, then as I already said, the
                        proposal of the U.N. Acting Secretary General U Thant on the so-called
                        “presence of the U.N.,” i.e. on establishing U.N. posts in the countries of
                        the Caribbean area would meet this task. This proposal of U Thant was also
                        supported as is known by the Government of the Republic of Cuba. We believe
                        it to be a reasonable basis on which it is possible to come to an agreement.
                        And it would be good if that idea was accepted by you and put into life.</p>
                    <p>To tell the truth, I am somewhat surprised that in connection with the idea
                        of “presence of the U.N.” in the Caribbean area you are talking for some
                        reason about setting up observation posts at the ports of the Soviet Union.
                        May be you have in mind the proposal which we submitted during the
                        negotiations on the problem of disarmament and on the problem of prevention
                        of surprise attack in 1955 and 1958. But those proposals had nothing to do
                        and cannot have anything to do with the question of Cuba since that question
                        simply did not exist at the time. Incidentally, I have already told you that
                        in our opinion it would be useful to get back to considering the proposals
                        to set up on a mutual basis the observation posts at airfields, major
                        sea-ports, railway junctions and auto routes. We have given our
                        representatives at the negotiation on disarmament in Geneva the necessary
                        instructions. I repeat—we would like to come to an <pb n="221"
                            xml:id="pg_221" facs="0243"/>agreement on this question and if you give
                        such instructions to your representatives at the negotiations on disarmament
                        we will only greet that.</p>
                    <p>Such is our viewpoint on the three questions raised by you: on the removal of
                        the IL-28 planes, on organizing the verification and on non-introduction to
                        Cuba of such weapons which in accordance with the agreement are removed from
                        Cuba.</p>
                    <p>How should we deal with the matter now so that we and you could soon bring
                        joy to humanity with the news that the crisis over Cuba is completely
                        liquidated?</p>
                    <p>The Government of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> in view of the
                        agreement reached on the IL-28 planes should immediately remove the
                        quarantine which corresponds to your own statement as well.</p>
                    <p>It is necessary to stick to generally recognized international norms and
                        rules fixed in the U.N. Charter—not to violate the territorial waters and
                        air space of sovereign states and stop the flights of American aircraft over
                        Cuba. I will tell you frankly, Mr. President, that I met with some relief
                        the report that during the last one-two days the flights of American planes
                        over Cuba did not take place. It is good if it promises maintaining of such
                        wise decision in the future as well.</p>
                    <p>Let both of us agree, Mr. President, also that our representatives in New
                        York be given at once the instructions to immediately proceed with working
                        out an agreed document (or documents) that would formalize through the U.N.
                        the commitments of the sides.</p>
                    <p>As we see the matter this will require only a few days if, of course, all the
                        sides want to have speediest liquidation of the aftermath of a tense and
                        dangerous situation evolved in the Caribbean area, the situation that really
                        brought humanity to the brink of thermonuclear war.</p>

                        this answer of mine gives you not bad material for your statement at your

                        agreement was reached between us and it is not in the interests of our
                        countries, not in the interests of peace to delay the fulfilment of the
                        agreement that has been reached and the final settlement of the Cuban
                        crisis. Such is our conviction.</p>

                                >Document 79</ref>.</note> which arrived in good time yesterday. As

                        the IL-28 bombers will be removed within a month.</p>
                    <p>I am now instructing our negotiators in New York to move ahead promptly with
                        proposals for a solution of the remaining elements in the Cuban problem. I
                        do not wish to confuse the discussion by trying to state our present
                        position in detail in this message, but I do want you to know that I
                        continue to believe that it is important to settle this matter promptly and
                        on reasonable terms, so that we may move on to other issues. I regret that
                        you have been unable to persuade Mr.<persName corresp="#p_CRF1"

                        our own means of information. But, as I said yesterday, <note n="2"

                            81</ref>.</note> I express great satisfaction. I fully trust the
                        statement made in that message too that the United States confirms its
                        commitment not to invade Cuba which you also confirmed in your statement at
                        the news conference.</p>
                    <p>In my confidential messages to you I have already laid down our understanding
                        of the questions and of those steps which are needed to normalize the
                        situation in the Caribbean area after the great and dangerous tension we and
                        you have lived through.</p>
                    <p>No less important questions are facing us now, that must be solved to avoid
                        recurrence of the situation which has just been eliminated through our
                        mutual efforts.</p>
                    <p>You say that I was not able to convince Prime-Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_CRF1">Fidel Castro</persName> about something. In general
                        you are partly right. But it should be taken into consideration that Cuba is
                        a young republic, the Cuban leaders being very able and devoted to their
                        people are however young, expansive people—Spaniards in a word, to use it
                        far from pejorative sense. But one should understand the position they are
                        in as the leaders of Cuba. The Republic of Cuba is a small country having
                        for its neighbour a big and powerful state—the United States of America, a
                        state which has been unfriendly to her since the first day the Cuban
                        revolution was born. Moreover, one should not forget either that there was
                        an invasion of Cuba.</p>
                    <p>That is what has to be taken into consideration in order to correctly assess
                        and understand the situation and, if you wish, the state of mind of the
                        leaders of Cuba. I even think that Prime-Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_CRF1">Fidel Castro</persName> may have looked upon some
                        questions with a great sense of understanding but he probably also
                        correlated his steps with the feelings of the Cuban people who are taken by
                        a great patriotic upsurge and desire to defend their independence. The Cuban
                        people and their desire are worthy of respect.</p>
                    <p>Of course, you and we have a different appraisal of the Cuban revolution and
                        of the events which developed around Cuba and of the position of the Cuban
                        leaders. But this is another matter. The different appraisal must not after
                        all prevent us from finding agreed solutions in the interest of peace. That
                        is what the peaceful coexistence is. One should <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225"
                            facs="0247"/>treat both sides with understanding and take into account
                        the actual state of things—in this case the situation in Cuba which has
                        chosen the way for its development in accordance with the will of its
                        people.</p>
                    <p>We have been doing with understanding and patience everything that was needed
                        and that was within our power to ensure the achievement of agreement on the
                        elimination of the remnants of the crisis. A great work has been done in
                        Cuba on our instructions by our representative, my first deputy A.I.
                        Mikoyan. Incidentally, he will come back soon because we have given him
                        appropriate instructions to this effect.</p>
                    <p>I understood your message in a sense that you yourself regard with
                        understanding the difficulties that still remain. I would wish that we
                        having accomplished the main thing, having given relief to the world public
                        and having given orders to the armed forces contributing to the
                        normalization of the situation—and we gave such order at once as soon as we
                        learned that analagous steps were taken on your side—that we would take
                        speedy measures to complete the settlement of the questions that would crown
                        all our efforts.</p>
                    <p>It would be necessary that appropriate instructions be also given to your
                        representative, Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>, for whom
                        we and I personally, after my meeting with him in Pitsunde last year, have
                        respect, despite the fact that he, as I told him half seriously and
                        half-jokingly, is a representative of Wall Street. True, he tried to
                        convince me that Wall Street was not so terrible a thing as I imagined. He
                        even promised when I happen to be in New York to take me to Wall Street to
                        try to convince me that this is so. I do not lose hope that one fine day
                            Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> will fulfil his
                        promise, that is, will take me to Wall Street. But generally, as you
                        understand, [that] is just a digression.</p>
                    <p>As for us, in connection with the completion of the questions which have not
                        been completed yet, we on our part have already given instructions to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> regarding proposals to
                        that effect which, as far as I know, have already been forwarded to the
                        attention of your representatives in New York. We consider these proposals
                        to be constructive, and we were guided by a desire to facilitate the
                        completion of our agreement.</p>
                    <p>Now I would like to express the following wish: it would be extremely useful
                        if while working on the proposals no steps are made on your part that would
                        be pin-pricks for the other participants in the negotiations and that would
                        create hooks capable of causing scratches to national pride and prestige of
                        these other participants. The main thing has been achieved indeed and at the
                        final stage it would be necessary to create good, reliable relations so
                        that, relying on common sense, on reason and on the understanding of all the
                        responsibility that lies upon you and us, to reach a final solution on a
                        firm reasonable basis and thus to create conditions for a good, stable
                        situation in the Caribbean area.</p>
                    <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0248"/>
                    <p>In this message of mine I do not raise any questions of substance since the
                        questions that must be completed are known to you. Let us then make a joint
                        effort to complete the remaining questions as well. This may serve as a good
                        omen for both our sides in working out an approach for the solution of other
                        not less important questions that we face. After all the question that you
                        and we are struggling with is, though important, but a particular one.
                        Meanwhile there are questions the solution of which is extremely important
                        for destinies of peace and they must be solved in order to really stabilize
                        the situation and secure lasting peace on earth.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>, It would seem that you and we
                        have come now to a final stage in the elimination of tension around Cuba.
                        Our relations are already entering now their normal course since all those
                        means placed by us on the Cuban territory which you considered offensive are
                        withdrawn and you ascertained that to which effect a statement was already
                        made by your side.</p>
                    <p>That is good. We appreciate that you just as we approached not dogmatically
                        the solution of the question of eliminating the tension which evolved and
                        this enabled us under existing conditions to find also a more flexible form
                        of verification of the withdrawal of the above mentioned means.
                        Understanding and flexibility displayed by you in this matter are highly
                        appreciated by us though our criticism of American imperialism remains in
                        force because that conflict was indeed created by the policy of the United
                        States with regard to Cuba.</p>
                    <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0249"/>
                    <p>More resolute steps should be taken now to move towards finalizing the
                        elimination of this tension, i.e. you on your part should clearly confirm at
                        the U.N. as you did at your press conference and in your messages to me the
                        pledge of non-invasion of Cuba by the United States and your allies having
                        removed reservations which are being introduced now into the U.S. draft
                        declaration in the Security Council and our representatives in New York
                        should come to terms with regard to an agreed wording in the declarations of
                        both powers of the commitments undertaken by them.</p>
                    <p>I believe that you already had an opportunity to familiarize yourself with
                        the text proposed by us <note n="1" xml:id="d83fn1">Transmitted in telegram
                            2179 from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, December 6; see <ref
                                target="frus1961-63v11#d234">vol. XI, Document 234</ref>.</note> of
                        a brief declaration of the Soviet Government in which the Soviet s'Union
                        main commitments resulting from the exchange of messages between us are
                        formulated. We proceed from the assumption that an analogous brief
                        declaration should be made by the U.S. Government and that the main U.S.
                        commitments resulting from the exchange of messages will also be fixed in
                        it. Have a look, Mr. President, at this proposal submitted by us through
                        your representatives in New York.</p>
                    <p>But notwithstanding what the agreement on the concrete texts of our
                        declarations at this concluding stage will be, anyway the basic goal has
                        been achieved and tension removed. I will tell you frankly that we have
                        removed our means from Cuba relying on your assurance that the United States
                        and its allies will not invade Cuba. Those means really had the purpose of
                        defending the sovereignty of Cuba and therefore after your assurance they
                        lost their purpose. We hope and we would like to believe—I spoke of that
                        publicly too, as you know—that you will adhere to the commitments which you
                        have taken, as strictly as we do with regard to our commitments. We, Mr.
                        President, have already fulfilled our commitments concerning the removal of
                        our missiles and IL-28 planes from Cuba and we did it even ahead of time. It
                        is obvious that fulfilment by you of your commitments cannot be as clearly
                        demonstrated as it was done by us since your commitments are of a long-term
                        nature. But it is important to fulfil them and to do everything so that no
                        doubts are sown from the very start that they will not be fulfilled. I
                        already told you at one time that our friends, especially those of them who
                        regard us with certain lack of understanding, are trying to convince us that
                        imperialism cannot be trusted, that is that you cannot be trusted, as a
                        representative of such capitalist state as the United States of America.</p>
                    <p>It goes without saying that you and I have different understanding of these
                        questions. I shall not go into details as to what my understanding is
                        because in this regard you and I cannot have common opinion since we <pb
                            n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0250"/>are people representing different
                        political poles. But there are things that require common understanding on
                        both sides and such common understanding is possible and even necessary.
                        This is what I would like to tell you about.</p>
                    <p>Within a short period of time we and you have lived through a rather acute
                        crisis. The acuteness of it was that we and you were already prepared to
                        fight and this would lead to a thermonuclear war. Yes, to a thermonuclear
                        world war with all its dreadful consequences. We took it into account and,
                        being convinced that mankind would never forgive the statesmen who would not
                        exhaust all possibilities to prevent catastrophe, agreed to a compromise
                        although we understood—and we state it now—that your claims had no grounds
                        whatsoever, had no legal basis and represented a manifestation of sheer
                        arbitrariness in international affairs. We agreed to a compromise because
                        our main purpose was to extend a helping hand to the Cuban people in order
                        to exclude the possibility of invasion of Cuba so that Cuba could exist and
                        develop as a free sovereign state. This is our main purpose today, it
                        remains to be our main purpose for tomorrow and we did not and do not pursue
                        any other purposes.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, Mr. President, everything—the stability in this area and not only
                        in this area but in the entire world—depends on how you will now fulfil the
                        commitments taken by you. Furthermore, it will be now a sort of litmus
                        paper, an indicator whether it is possible to trust if similar difficulties
                        arise in other geographical areas. I think you will agree that if our
                        arrangement for settling the Cuban crisis fails it will undermine a
                        possibility for manoeuvre which you and we would resort to for elimination
                        of danger, a possibility for compromise in the future if similar
                        difficulties arise in other areas of the world, and they really can arise.
                        We attach great significance to all this, and subsequent development will
                        depend on you as President and on the U.S. Government.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the guarantees for non-invasion of Cuba given by you will be
                        maintained and not only in the period of your stay in the White House, that,
                        to use an expression, goes without saying. We believe that you will be able
                        to receive a mandate at the next election too, that is that you will be the
                        U.S. President for six years, which would appeal to us. At our times, six
                        years in world politics is a long period of time and during that period we
                        could create good conditions for peaceful coexistence on earth and this
                        would be highly appreciated by the peoples of our countries as well as by
                        all other peoples.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, Mr. President, I would like to express a wish that you follow the
                        right way, as we do, in appraising the situation. Now it is of special
                        importance to provide for the possibility of an exchange of opinion through
                        confidential channels which you and I have set up and which we use. But the
                        confidential nature of our personal relations will depend on <pb n="229"
                            xml:id="pg_229" facs="0251"/>whether you fulfil—as we did—the
                        commitments taken by you and give instructions to your representatives in
                        New York to formalize these commitments in appropriate documents. This is
                        needed in order that all the peoples be sure that tension in the Caribbean
                        is a matter of yesterday and that now normal conditions have been really
                        created in the world. And for this it is necessary to fix the assumed
                        commitments in the documents of both sides and register them with the United
                        Nations.</p>
                    <p>You, Mr. President, do not want to agree with the five conditions put forward
                        by Prime Minister of the Republic of Cuba <persName corresp="#p_CRF1">Fidel
                            Castro</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">In Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_CRF1">Castro</persName>'s October 28 letter to
                            U Thant; for text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy:
                                Current Documents, 1962</hi>, pp. 447-448.</note> But, indeed, these
                        five principles correspond fully to the provisions of the United Nations
                        Charter which is a legal basis for the relations among states, a sort of
                        foundation for securing peace and peaceful coexistence. I will tell you
                        frankly that such position of yours is surprising. Maybe you have some
                        difficulties. But, Mr. President, we who occupy such responsible position in
                        the world and who are endowed with high trust have to overcome those
                        difficulties. The peoples will appreciate that because for them it means
                        insuring lasting peace on earth.</p>
                    <p>I would like to express to you my disapproval of certain things. We read now
                        various articles by your columnists and correspondents and we are concerned
                        that in those articles they are widely commenting on the confidential
                        exchange of opinion and it is being done by the people who as it would seem
                        have no relation to confidential channels set up between us. Judging by the
                        contents of these articles it is clear that their authors are well informed
                        and we get an impression that this is not a result of an accidental leak of
                        the confidential information but a result of benevolence for those people
                        into whose hands gets the information they make public. This evidently is
                        done for the purpose of informing the public in a one-sided way.</p>
                    <p>Frankly speaking, if we use the confidential communications this way, it will
                        be far from facilitating confidence in those channels. You yourself realize
                        that if your side begins to act in the way that our exchange of opinion by
                        way of confidential channels will leak through fingers these channels will
                        cease to be of use and may even cause harm. But this is up to you. If you
                        consider that those channels have outlived themselves and are of no use any
                        longer, then we also will draw appropriate conclusions in this respect. I
                        tell you this straightforwardly and I would like to know your opinion on
                        this matter. I have been denouncing American imperialism. But on the other
                        hand I consider it useful for us to continue to maintain the possibility of
                        confidential exchange of opinion because a minimum of personal trust is
                        necessary for leading statesmen <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0252"/>of
                        both countries and this corresponds to the interests of our countries and
                        peoples, to the interest of peace all over the world.</p>
                    <p>Let us, Mr. President, eliminate promptly the consequences of the Cuban
                        crisis and get down to solving other questions, and we have them in number.
                        As far as nuclear test ban is concerned this is a minor question on the
                        whole. I am going to address to you a confidential letter <note n="3"
                            xml:id="d83fn3"><ref target="#d85">Document 85</ref>.</note> and
                        proposals on this question and I hope that we will overcome difficulties
                        existing in this question. The problem of disarmament is a different matter;
                        it is a major and difficult question now.</p>
                    <p>But, of course, the main question is the German question and it is an easy
                        and at the same time difficult one. I say that it is an easy and at the same
                        time difficult question. But this is really so. It is easy because our
                        proposals for concluding a peace treaty do not demand any concessions from
                        either side, neither do they demand any losses from either side. These
                        proposals only fix the situation which has developed as a result of World
                        War II.</p>
                    <p>After the talks that our Minister of Foreign Affairs <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA1">A. Gromyko</persName> had with your Secretary of State
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">D. Rusk</persName>, only one question in
                        effect remained unresolved—that of troops in West Berlin: troops of what
                        countries, for what term and under what flag will be stationed there.</p>
                    <p>I would like you to understand me correctly on this question. Let us solve
                        it. We will not escape the necessity to solve this question anyway. To tell
                        the truth, this question is not worth an eggshell if a realistic approach is
                        employed in appraising the situation in Germany where two sovereign German
                        states have developed and if a course followed is aimed at an agreement on
                        West Berlin and not at leaving it to remain a dangerous hot-bed of collision
                        between states. Should really you and we—two great states—submit, willingly
                        or unwillingly, our policy, the interests of our states to the old-aged man
                        who both morally and physically is with one foot in grave? Should we really
                        become toys in his hands? By concluding peace treaty we would lose nothing
                        but we would gain a possibility to strengthen friendly relations between our
                        states, would untie the knot in Europe which is fraught with danger for the
                        whole world only because most extreme aggressive militarist forces in West
                        Germany are interested in this.</p>
                    <p>Please, excuse me for my straightforwardness and frankness but I believe as
                        before that a frank and straightforward exchange of opinion is needed to
                        avoid the worst.</p>
                    <p>Please, convey to your wife and your family wishes of good health from
                        myself, my wife and my entire family.<note n="4" xml:id="d83fn4">Printed

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Chairman</hi>: I was glad to have your message
                        of December 11th <note n="1" xml:id="d84fn1"><ref target="#d83">Document
                                83</ref>.</note> and to know that you believe, as we do, that we
                        have come to the final stage of the Cuban affair between us, the settlement
                        of which will have significance for our future relations and for our ability
                        to overcome other difficulties. I wish to thank you for your expression of
                        appreciation of the understanding and flexibility we have tried to
                        display.</p>
                    <p>I have followed with close attention the negotiations on the final settlement
                        of the Cuban question between your representative, Mr.<persName
                            corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName>, and our representatives,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> and
                            Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>, in New York. In these
                        negotiations we have tried to understand your position and I am glad to note
                        that Mr. Kusnetsov has also shown effort to understand our problems. It is
                        clearly in the interest of both sides that we reach agreement on how finally
                        to dispose of the Cuban crisis. To this end, Ambassador
                            <persName>Stevenson</persName> and Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1"
                            >McCloy</persName> presented on Wednesday a new draft of a joint
                        statement which by now has certainly reached you.<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2"

                            December 11; see <ref target="frus1961-63v11#d243">vol. XI, Document
                                243</ref>.</note> I wish to assure you that it is our purpose to end
                        this affair as simply and clearly as possible.</p>
                    <p>You refer to the importance of my statements on an invasion of Cuba and of
                        our intention to fulfill them, so that no doubts are sown from the very
                        start. I have already stated my position publicly in my press conference on
                        November 20th, and I am glad that this statement appears to have your
                        understanding; we have never wanted to be driven by the acts of others into
                        war in Cuba. The other side of the coin, however, is that we do need to have
                        adequate assurances that all offensive weapons are removed from Cuba and are
                        not reintroduced, and that Cuba itself commits no aggressive acts against
                        any of the nations of the Western Hemisphere. As I understand you, you feel
                        confident that Cuba will not in fact engage in such aggressive acts, and of
                        course I already have your own assurance about the offensive weapons. So I
                        myself should suppose that you could accept our position—but it is probably
                        better to leave final discussion of these matters to our representatives in
                        New York. I quite agree with you that the larger part of the crisis has now
                        been ended and we should not permit others to stand in the way of promptly
                        settling the rest without further acrimony.</p>
                    <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0254"/>
                    <p>With regard to your reference to the confidential channels set up between us,
                        I can assure you that I value them. I have not concealed from you that it
                        was a serious disappointment to me that dangerously misleading information
                        should have come through these channels before the recent crisis. You may
                        also wish to know that by an accident or misunderstanding one of your
                        diplomats appears to have used a represent-ative of a private television
                        network as a channel to us. This is always unwise in our country, where the
                        members of the press often insist on printing at some later time what they
                        may learn privately.</p>
                    <p>Because our systems are so different, you may not be fully familiar with the
                        practice of the American press. The competition for news in this country is
                        fierce. A number of the competitors are not great admirers of my
                        Administration, and perhaps an even larger number are not wholly friendly to
                        yours. Here in Washington we have 1200 reporters accredited to the White
                        House alone, and thousands more in other assignments. Not one of them is
                        accountable to this government for what he reports. It would be a great
                        mistake to think that what appears in newspapers and magazines necessarily
                        has anything to do with the policy and purpose of this government. I am glad
                        to say that I have some friends among newspapermen, but no spokesmen.</p>
                    <p>But let me emphasize again that we do indeed value these confidential
                        channels. I entirely share your view that some trust is necessary for
                        leading statesmen of our two countries; I believe that it is important to
                        build the area of trust wherever possible. I shall of course continue to
                        hold and to express my convictions about the relative merits of our systems
                        of government, and I will not be surprised if you do the same.</p>
                    <p>In particular, we have been very glad to have opportunities for private
                        exchanges with and through Mr.<persName corresp="#p_BGN1"
                            >Bolshakov</persName>, and I am sorry to learn that he is returning to
                        Moscow. It is our impression that he has made a real effort to improve
                        communications and understanding between our two governments, and we shall
                        miss him very much.</p>
                    <p>I appreciate your writing me so frankly, and in return I have tried to be as
                        straightforward, for I agree with you that only through such frank exchanges
                        can we better understand our respective points of view. Partly for this
                        reason I refrained in my last press conference from commenting on certain
                        aspects of your speech before the Supreme Soviet with which you realize, of
                        course, we could not agree.</p>
                    <p>We also are hopeful that once the Cuban crisis is behind us, we shall be able
                        to tackle the other problems confronting us and to find the path to their
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>I cannot refrain from commenting briefly on your reference to the German
                        question, though I do not think that it would be useful in this message to
                        expound our full position once again. But your suggestion that the interests
                        of our two countries are toys in the hands of Chancellor <pb n="233"
                            xml:id="pg_233" facs="0255"/><persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                            >Adenauer</persName> seems to me to miss entirely the true nature of the
                        problem which confronts us in Central Europe. For here the vital interests
                        of many states are involved—on your side as well as ours. If this is
                        recognized, then I am confident that a way can be found which will
                        accommodate these interests and which will lead to a peaceful settlement. I
                        cannot quite agree with you that Mr.<persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                            >Rusk</persName> and Mr.<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        have settled everything on Berlin but one issue. They are skillful and
                        experienced diplomats, but I do not think we should give them too much
                        credit yet. Still it is quite true, as you say, that the main issue which
                        seems to separate us on Berlin is that of the presence of allied troops in
                        West Berlin. I am confident that if you could begin from an understanding of
                        our position on this vital point, our chances of making progress would be
                        greatly improved.</p>
                    <p>I look forward to receiving your confidential letter and proposals on the
                        test ban question, and I think there is every reason to keep working on this
                        problem. I hope that in your message on this subject you will tell me what
                        you think about the position of the people in Peking on this question. It
                        seems to me very important for both of us that in our efforts to secure an
                        end to nuclear testing we should not overlook this area of the world.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your expressions of good wishes to me and my family, and let me
                        in turn send you and your wife and family our personal good wishes for the
                        coming year.<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3">Printed from an unsigned

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>, In our recent correspondence
                        related to the events in the Caribbean area we have touched on the question
                        of cessation of nuclear weapon tests. Today I would like to come back again
                        to that problem and to set forth my views concerning possible ways of its
                        speediest solution which would be mutually acceptable to both our sides.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me, Mr. President, that time has come now to put an end once and
                        for all to nuclear tests, to draw a line through such tests. The moment for
                        this is very, very appropriate. Left behind is a period of utmost acuteness
                        and tension in the Caribbean. Now we have untied our hands to engage closely
                        in other urgent international matters and, in particular, in such a problem
                        which has been ripe for so long as cessation of nuclear tests. A certain
                        relaxation of international tension which has emerged now should, in my
                        view, facilitate this.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union does not need war. I think that war does not promise bright
                        prospects for the United States either. If in the past after every war
                        America used to increase its economic potential and to accumulate more and
                        more wealth, now war with the use of modern rocket—nuclear weapons will
                        stride across seas and oceans within minutes. Thermonuclear catastrophe will
                        bring enormous losses and sufferings to the American people as well as to
                        other peoples on earth. To prevent this we must, on the basis of complete
                        equality and with just regard for each other's interests, develop between
                        ourselves peaceful relations and solve all issues through negotiations and
                        mutual concessions.</p>
                    <p>One of such questions with which the governments of our countries have been
                        dealing for many years is the question of concluding a treaty banning all
                        tests of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Both of us stand on the same position with regard to the fact that national
                        means of detection are sufficient to control banning experimental nuclear
                        explosions in outer space, in the atmosphere and under water. So far,
                        however, we have not succeeded in finding a mutually acceptable solution to
                        the problem of cessation of underground tests. The main obstacle to an
                        agreement is the demand by the American side of international control and
                        inspection on the territories of nuclear powers over cessation <pb n="235"
                            xml:id="pg_235" facs="0257"/>of underground nuclear tests. I would like
                        to believe that you yourself understand the rightness of our arguments that
                        now national means are sufficient to control also this kind of tests and be
                        sure that agreement is observed by any side. But so far you do not want to
                        recognize openly this actual state of things and to accept it as a basis for
                        concluding without delay an agreement on cessation of tests.</p>
                    <p>Striving to find a mutually acceptable basis for agreement the Soviet Union
                        has made lately an important step toward the West and agreed to installing
                        automatic seismic stations. This idea, as is known, was put forward not by
                        us. It was introduced by British scientists during the recent meeting in
                        London of the participants of Pugwash movement. Moreover, it is well known
                        to us, that when this idea was proposed, it was not alien to your scientists
                        who were in London at that time.</p>
                    <p>We proposed to install such stations both near the borders of nuclear powers
                        and directly on their territories. We stated our agreement that three such
                        stations be installed on the territory of the Soviet Union in the zones most
                        frequently subjected to earthquakes. There are three such zones in the
                        Soviet Union where these stations can be installed: Central Asian, Altaian
                        and Far Eastern.</p>
                    <p>In the opinion of Soviet scientists the most suitable places for locating
                        automatic seismic stations in the Soviet Union are area of the city of
                        Kokcnetav for Central Asian zone of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, area of the city of Bodaibo for Altaian zone and area of
                        the city of Yakutsk for Far Eastern zone. However, should, as a result of
                        exchange of opinion between our representatives, other places be suggested
                        for locating automatic seismic stations in these seismic zones, we will be
                        ready to discuss this question and find mutually acceptable solution.</p>
                    <p>Beside the above said zones there are two more seismic zones in the Soviet
                        Union—Caucasian and Carpathian. However these zones are so densely populated
                        that conducting nuclear tests there is practically excluded.</p>
                    <p>Of course, delivery to and from international center of appropriate sealed
                        equipment for its periodic replacement at automatic seismic stations in the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could well be made by Soviet
                        personnel and on Soviet planes. However if for such delivery of equipment to
                        and from automatic seismic stations participation of foreign personnel were
                        needed we would agree to this also, having taken, if necessary,
                        precautionary measures against use of such trips for reconnaissance. Thus
                        our proposal on automatic seismic stations includes elements of
                        international control. This is a major act of good will on the part of the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>I will tell you straightforwardly that before making this proposal I have
                        consulted thoroughly the specialists and after such consultation my
                        colleagues in the Government and I came to a conclusion that so far as the
                        Soviet Union is concerned the above said considerations on the measures <pb
                            n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0258"/>on our part are well founded and,
                        it seems to us, they should not cause objections on the part of the American
                        side.</p>
                    <p>You, Mr. President, and your representatives point out that without at least
                        a minimum number of on-site inspections you will not manage to persuade the
                        U.S. Senate to ratify an agreement on the cessation of tests. This
                        circumstance, as we understand, ties you and does not allow you to sign a
                        treaty which would enable all of us to abandon for good the grounds where
                        nuclear weapons are tested. Well, if this is the only difficulty on the way
                        to agreement, then for the noble and humane goal of ceasing nuclear weapon
                        tests we are ready to meet you halfway in this question.</p>
                    <p>We noted that on this October 30, in conversation with First Deputy Foreign
                        Minister of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss><persName
                            corresp="#p_KVV2">V.V. Kuznetsov</persName> in New York, your
                        representative Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean</persName> stated
                        that, in the opinion of the U.S. Government, it would be sufficient to carry
                        on 2-4 on-site inspections each year on the territory of the Soviet Union.
                        According to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean</persName>'s
                        statement, the United States would also be prepared to work out measures
                        which would rule out any possibility of carrying on espionage under the
                        cover of these inspection trips including such measures as the use of Soviet
                        planes piloted by Soviet crews for transportation of inspectors to the
                        sites, screening of windows in the planes, prohibition to carry
                        photo-cameras, etc.</p>
                    <p>We took all this into account and, in order to overcome the deadlock and to
                        arrive at least at a mutually acceptable agreement, we would agree, in those
                        cases when it would be considered necessary, to 2-3 inspections a year on
                        the territory of each of the nuclear powers in the seismic areas where some
                        suspicious earth's tremors might occur. It goes without saying that the
                        basis of control over an agreement on underground nuclear test ban would be
                        the national means of detection in combination with automatic seismic
                        stations. On-site inspections could be carried on with the precautions
                        mentioned by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean</persName> against
                        any misuse of control for purposes of espionage.</p>
                    <p>We believe that now the road to agreement is straight and clear. Beginning
                        from January 1 of the new year of 1963 the world can be relieved of the roar
                        of nuclear explosions. The peoples are waiting for this—this is what the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly has called for. With
                        the elimination of the Cuban crisis we relieved mankind of the direct menace
                        of combat use of lethal nuclear weapons that impended over the world. Can't
                        we solve a far simpler question—that of cessation of experimental explosions
                        of nuclear weapons in the peaceful conditions? I think that we can and must
                        do it. Here lies now our duty before the peoples of not only our countries
                        but of all other countries. Having solved promptly also this question—and
                        there are all the preconditions for that—we shall be able to facilitate
                        working out an agreement on disarmament and with even more confidence <pb
                            n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0259"/>proceed with solving other urgent
                        international problems, which we and you unfortunately are not short of.</p>

                    <p>By direction of the President, I made the following statement to Ambassador

                                that the Polaris missiles which he has agreed to make available for
                                a small British submarine force to be assigned to <gloss

                                1969 or 1970. The President's chief concern in making these missiles
                                available was to prevent, or at least delay, the development of
                                national nuclear capabilities. Failure on his part to provide a
                                substitute for Skybolt missile would have meant a serious rift in
                                British/American relations and would undoubtedly have resulted in
                                British efforts to create their own missile, not tied into <gloss

                                developed a separate German effort to do the same.</p>
                            <p>“The President believes his action in this matter has kept open the

                                and has gained time for our further efforts in the field of
                                disarmament. It is clear that real progress in disarmament would
                                take priority over any such arrangements which were made in the

                        ban, I therefore sincerely hope that the suggestions that you have made in
                        your letter will prove to be helpful in starting us down the road to an
                        agreement. I am encouraged that you are prepared to accept the principle of
                        on-site inspections. These seem to me to be essential not just because of
                        the concern of our Congress but because they seem to us to go to the heart
                        of a reliable agreement ending nuclear testing.</p>
                    <p>If we are to have peace between systems with far-reaching ideological
                        differences, we must find ways for reducing or removing the recurring waves
                        of fear and suspicion which feed on ignorance, misunderstanding or what
                        appear to one side or the other as broken agreements. To me, the element of
                        assurance is vital to the broader development of peaceful relationships.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the question of on-site inspections I would certainly agree
                        that we could accept any reasonable provision which you had in mind to
                        protect against your concern that the on-site inspectors might engage in
                        “espionage” en route to the area of inspection. In a statement at the United
                        Nations, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName>
                        suggested that the United States would accept any reasonable security
                        provision while the inspectors were being taken to the site, so long as they
                        had reasonable provision for satisfying themselves that they were actually
                        at the intended location and had the freedom necessary to inspect the
                        limited designated area.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the number of on-site inspections there appears to have been
                        some misunderstanding. Your impression seems to be that Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD3">Dean</persName> told Deputy Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> that the United States might be
                        prepared to accept an annual number of on-site inspections between two and
                        four. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean</persName> advises me that
                        the only <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0261"/>number which he mentioned
                        in his discussions with Deputy Minister <persName corresp="#p_KVV2"
                            >Kuznetsov</persName> was a number between eight and ten. This
                        represented a substantial decrease in the request of the United States as we
                        had previously been insisting upon a number between twelve and twenty. I had
                        hoped that the Soviet Union would match this motion on the part of the
                        United States by an equivalent motion in the figure of two or three on-site
                        inspections which it had some time ago indicated it might allow.</p>
                    <p>I am aware that this matter of on-site inspections has given you considerable
                        difficulty although I am not sure that I fully understand why this should be
                        so. To me, an effective nuclear test ban treaty is of such importance that I
                        would not permit such international arrangements to become mixed up with our
                        or any other national desire to seek other types of information about the
                        Soviet Union. I believe quite sincerely that arrangements could be worked
                        out which would convince you and your colleagues that this is the case.</p>
                    <p>But in this connection, your implication that on-site inspections should be
                        limited to seismic areas also gives us some difficulty. It is true that in
                        the ordinary course we would have concern about events taking place in the
                        seismic areas. However, an unidentified seismic event coming from an area in
                        which there are not usually earthquakes would be a highly suspicious event.
                        The United States would feel that in such a circumstance the U.S.S.R. would
                        be entitled to an on-site inspection of such an event occurring in our area
                        and feels that the United States should have the same rights within its
                        annual quota of inspections.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps your comment would be that a seismic event in another area designated
                        for inspection might coincide with a highly sensitive defense installation.
                        I recognize this as a real problem but believe that some arrangement can be
                        worked out which would prevent this unlikely contingency from erecting an
                        insuperable obstacle.</p>
                    <p>Your suggestion as to the three locations in the Soviet Union in which there
                        might be unmanned seismic stations is helpful but it does not seem to me to
                        go far enough. These stations are all outside the areas of highest
                        seismicity and therefore do not record all of the phenomena within those
                        areas. These stations would be helpful in increasing the detection
                        capability of the system but I doubt that they would have the same value in
                        reducing the number of suspicious seismic events by identifying some as
                        earthquakes. For this purpose unmanned seismic stations should be in the
                        areas of highest seismicity, not outside them. To achieve this result there
                        would be need for a number of stations in the vicinity of the Kamchatka area
                        and a number in the Tashkent area. It might be possible, of course, to
                        reduce somewhat the number actually in the Soviet Union by arranging
                        stations in Hokkaido, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. If the stations on Soviet
                        territory were sited in locations free from local disturbances and could be
                        monitored periodically by competent <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0262"
                        />United States or international observers who took in portable seismometers
                        and placed them on the pedestals it would be very helpful in reducing the
                        problem of identification.</p>
                    <p>You have referred to the discussion of the “black box” proposal at the Tenth
                        Pugwash Conference in London in September of this year <note n="2"
                            xml:id="d87fn2">See <ref target="#d56fn2">footnote 2, Document
                            56</ref>.</note> as a United Kingdom proposal to which the United States
                        has agreed. I do not believe that this was the situation. This proposal was
                        reported to me as a Soviet proposal which was discussed with some United
                        States scientists. Of the United States scientists who signed the statement
                        none represented the United States Government or had discussed the matter
                        with responsible officials. All were speaking as individuals and none were
                        seismologists. Their agreement does not signify anything other than that
                        this was an area which justified further study. The United States Government
                        has given it that study and the results have been the conclusions which I
                        have indicated above.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding these problems, I am encouraged by your letter. I do not
                        believe that any of the problems which I have raised are insoluble but they
                        ought to be solved. I wonder how you think we might best proceed with these
                        discussions which may require some technical development. It occurs to me
                        that you might wish to have your representative meet with Mr.<persName
                            corresp="#p_FWC2">William C. Foster</persName>, the Director of our Arms

                        been held we will then be in a position to evaluate where we stand and
                        continue our work together for an effective agreement ending all nuclear
                            tests.<note n="3" xml:id="d87fn3">Printed from an unsigned

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>, I am grateful to you for your
                        wish to clarify the considerations by which, as you tell us, the U.S.
                        Government was guided in taking the decision regarding making Polaris
                        missiles available for the disposal of Britain.<note n="1" xml:id="d88fn1"
                            >See <ref target="#d86">Document 86</ref>.</note> You note that the
                        Polaris missiles will be given to small British submarine forces which will
                        be assigned to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and that these missiles
                        are not expected to be operational before 1969-70.</p>
                    <p>I took notice of your words that the President's chief concern in making the
                        decision on availability for transfer of the Polaris missiles was to prevent
                        or at least delay the development of national nuclear capabilities and that
                        you seek to gain time for further efforts in the field of disarmament. I
                        would like to regard what you said with understanding. But in your turn,
                        please regard with understanding those thoughts which cannot but come to our
                        mind in connection with the step which you are taking.</p>
                    <p>If one is to appraise this step objectively, i.e. not only from the point of
                        view of its effect on the relations between the U.S. and Britain, between
                        the U.S. and its other allies in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, not
                        only from the point of view of what type of destructive weapons is more
                        suitable or costs less for them to manufacture, then the conclusion can be
                        only one—this still is a matter of expansion of armaments of states. Yes,
                        the agreement regarding the Polaris missiles reached on the Bahamas is one
                        more effort in the implementation of the plans for nuclear armament,
                        armament that is, while the peoples are awaiting from statesmen and
                        governments efforts in a completely different direction—to scrap the war
                        machine of states, to destroy all means of annihilation of people.</p>
                    <p>We are sorry that the essence of the question on which you informed me is
                        still armament. Measures on which you inform us lead not to creating
                        conditions facilitating general and complete disarmament, not to clearing
                        road to agreement but to further intensification of arms race. This can only
                        grieve all those people who see in general and complete disarmament a really
                        reliable guarantee of peace.</p>
                    <p>In the messages which we exchanged the two of us expressed more than once our
                        desire to seek mutually acceptable solutions to the questions of
                        disarmament. Unfortunately, however, in those U.N. committees and
                        subcommittees where negotiations on disarmament are conducted, <pb n="242"
                            xml:id="pg_242" facs="0264"/>in particular, in the 18 Nation Committee
                        in Geneva they do not yet go beyond declarations of readiness for
                        disarmament.</p>
                    <p>I do not think that in this message I should touch more in detail on the
                        negotiations on disarmament. I touched on this topic because I cannot but
                        express my concern that every meeting of statesmen of the Western powers
                        regardless of the level of these meetings is devoted first of all to working
                        out new armament programs.</p>
                    <p>I was informed that you consider interesting the proposal concerning nuclear
                        test ban which was contained in my recent message to you. This makes me
                        hopeful.</p>
                    <p>I send you, your wife and your entire family good wishes and New Year's

                    <p>Upon his return from the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MAI1">A.I. Mikoyan</persName> told me that during your talk
                        with him you took up, among other problems, the question of Laos.</p>
                    <p>We reached an agreement with you in Vienna that Laos would be neutral and
                        independent. The subsequent exchange of views on the Laos question, which
                        took place unofficially between us after Vienna, in my opinion, also was
                        held in a spirit of necessary mutual understanding and contributed to the
                        success of the Geneva conference on Laos.</p>
                    <p>What was accomplished as a result of the activity of this international
                        conference is highly important. The Geneva agreements on Laos not only
                        reestablished peace in that country and created the bases for its
                        development along the path of neutrality and independence but also showed
                        that, when the countries concerned desire settlement, all kinds of
                        international problems can be resolved, especially if the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                            >USA</gloss> join forces in the interest of clearing up centers of
                        tension. It is now important that the agreements on Laos be fully
                        implemented.</p>
                    <p>As a result of the protracted civil war, the Laos of today has inherited a
                        series of internal problems which must be settled between the three
                        political forces of the nation. We proceeded, and are proceeding, from the
                        premise that these internal problems must be resolved by the Laotians
                        themselves, without any interference from outside. However, it must be
                        recognized that the difficulties in resolving certain Laotian internal
                        problems complicate considerably the full implementation of the Geneva
                        agreements on Laos.</p>
                    <p>It is true that some success has now been achieved in settling the internal
                        problems in Laos. Specifically, the recent agreement reached by the three
                        factions in Laos on the subject of the unification of their armed forces and
                        police is an indubitable step forward. However, such progress has not been
                        noted in all the problems that require solution. The main obstacle on this
                        path is still the unsurmounted distrust among the factions in Laos, which
                        arose during the period of hostilities in that country. During the period of
                        the armed struggle such a large amount of suspicion and mutual distrust
                        accumulated that to remove it will require time and appropriate efforts and
                        not only on the part of the Laotians.</p>
                    <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0267"/>
                    <p>You implied that the Democratic People's Republic of Viet-Nam had not
                        withdrawn all its troops from Laos. But the Government of the Democratic
                        People's Republic of Viet-Nam informed us that all the Vietnamese personnel
                        had been completely withdrawn from Laos and that there are no Vietnamese
                        troops there now. In this connection, I should like also to call your
                        attention to the joint Laos-Viet-Nam communique, issued after the stay in
                        Hanoi of the Laos Government delegation, headed by General Nosavan. In this
                        communique it was stated that, in accordance with the Geneva agreement, the
                        Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Viet-Nam had withdrawn
                        from Laos all of its military personnel which was sent there at the request
                        of the government of Prince <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna
                            Phouma</persName>. The Laos Government delegation declared its
                        satisfaction with the policy of the Government of the Democratic People's
                        Republic of Viet-Nam, as outlined above, and expressed its trust in it.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, our friends say that up to now the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                            >USA</gloss> has by no means removed all of its military personnel from
                        Laos, but [merely]<note n="1" xml:id="d91fn1">Brackets in the source
                            text.</note> dressed some of its military personnel in civilian clothes
                        and left them in that country. They also point out that in the territory of
                        Laos there are still some adherents of Chiang-Kai-shek. They report that
                        American aircraft after the conclusion of Geneva agreements still continue
                        to fly without the permission of the Laos Government over the territory of
                        Laos and drop guerilla groups and arms.</p>
                    <p>The absence of a settlement of a series of internal problems and the distrust
                        still prevailing engender undesirable incidents such as, for example, the
                        loss of an American airplane in the Plaine des Jarres. Certainly, that was a
                        sad incident, it cost men's lives, it brought sorrow to their families. It
                        demonstrates once more the necessity of creating in Laos a situation in
                        which such incidents could not take place.</p>
                    <p>I think that a great deal in this connection depends on all the countries
                        party to the Geneva agreements on Laos, including the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, contributing to their implementation by
                        observing their conditions exactly and thus making it possible for the
                        Laotians to resolve their internal problems.</p>
                    <p>In so far as the Soviet Union is concerned, I must tell you that our
                        Government is doing everything possible to ensure the implementation of the
                        Geneva agreements. In conversations with <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna
                            Phouma</persName>, with Prince <persName>Souvanavong</persName> and,
                        quite recently, with General Nosavan, all of whom at various times came to
                        the Soviet Union, we tried to emphasize the necessity of their getting along
                        with each other and of finding a common language. We insistently recommended
                        to them that they faithfully <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0268"/>carry
                        out the Geneva agreements, that they quickly resolve their internal
                        political problems on the basis of the political program of the coalition
                        government, which program they themselves approved, that they not permit
                        violation of the peace in Laos, and that they show the necessary
                        restraint.</p>
                    <p>In view of the urgent need of Laos to rebuild its economy which was wrecked
                        by the war, the Soviet Government complied with the request of the coalition
                        Government of Laos and decided to grant it certain economic assistance in
                        accordance with the principles of the Geneva agreements. You undoubtedly are
                        aware that we transferred to the coalition Government of Laos our planes
                        which carried freight from the Democratic People's Republic of Viet-Nam to
                        Laos.</p>
                    <p>I think that you will agree that the strengthening of peace in Laos is
                        indissolubly bound up with the situation in the neighboring countries. But I
                        want to tell you frankly that the policy the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                            >USA</gloss> is now following in South Viet-Nam in no way promotes the
                        normalization of the situation in Laos. I have in mind the presence and
                        extensive use of American troops in South Viet-Nam. The tension on the
                        Cambodian borders should also be given consideration.</p>
                    <p>Guided by our desire to improve the situation in Southeast Asia, we, for
                        example, supported the proposal of Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPN1"
                            >Norodom Sihanouk</persName> to convene an international conference for
                        the purpose of concluding an agreement that would guarantee the
                        independence, neutrality, and territorial integrity of Cambodia. I have
                        learned that this proposal of Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPN1"
                            >Sihanouk</persName> has not yet met with the support of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>These are the considerations that I wanted to express in connection with what
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">A.I. Mikoyan</persName> said to you about
                        Laos. Our earnest desire is that Laos be a peaceful, neutral, and
                        independent nation and that the Geneva agreements on Laos be observed, which
                        we consider would constitute great progress toward maintaining peace in
                        Southeast Asia and a good example of how, if all interested nations strive
                        to reach the same goal, that of peace, they can always find a common
                        language and come to an agreement.</p>

                        note your agreement that installation of automatic seismic stations will
                        prove useful from the point of view of increasing the effectiveness of
                        control over cessation of underground nuclear explosions. During the Geneva
                        talks it was justly observed, also by your representatives, that
                        installation of such seismic stations would serve as good means of verifying
                        the correctness of functioning of national seismic stations. It is precisely
                        by these considerations that the Soviet Government was guided in proposing
                        that the idea of installing automatic seismic stations put forward at the
                        Pugwash meeting of scientists be utilized.</p>
                    <p>In my message of December 19, 1962, I indicated those three areas where in
                        the opinion of our scientists automatic seismic stations should be set up on
                        the territory of the Soviet Union. Those areas were selected after a
                        thorough study with comprehensive consideration being given to geological
                        and seismic conditions in those places.</p>
                    <p>In the areas of Kokchetav and Bodaibo automatic seismic stations would be
                        located, according to our suggestion, at the exposures of crystalline rocks
                        while in the Yakutsk area—in the zone of eternal congelation [permafrost].
                        As is known on crystalline rocks and on grounds frozen deep down always only
                        minor seismic hindrances are noticed which facilitate reliable detection of
                        underground nuclear explosions. In combination with seismic stations abroad,
                        on territories adjacent to the seismic zones in the Soviet Union automatic
                        stations located in the above mentioned points will be adequate means
                        capable of removing possible doubts of the other side with regard to the
                        correctness of functioning of the national seismic station network.</p>
                    <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0270"/>
                    <p>You did not make any comments on the location of an automatic seismic station
                        for the Altai zone in the region of the city of Bodaibo, and thus we could
                        consider this question as agreed upon.</p>
                    <p>However, you have doubts as to the location of automatic seismic stations for
                        the other seismic zones in the Soviet Union—Far Eastern and Central Asian
                        ones. As far as those zones are concerned, in your opinion, it would be
                        expedient to place such stations in the Kamchatka area and in the area of
                        Tashkent. In the opinion of Soviet scientists placing automatic seismic
                        stations in the areas of Tashkent and Kamchatka would be a worse variant as
                        compared to the one that we propose because in those areas functioning of
                        automatic stations will be seriously handicapped by seismic hindrances. But
                        if you believe it more expedient to relocate those stations we will not
                        object to that. In my message to you I have already pointed out that the
                        Soviet Union is prepared to seek a mutually acceptable solution also in the
                        question of location of automatic seismic stations. We would agree to
                        relocate the automatic seismic station for Central Asian zone of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to the Tashkent area placing it near the
                        city of Samarkand and for the Far Eastern zone—to place the automatic
                        station at Seimchan which is part of the Kamchatka seismic area.</p>
                    <p>Location of an automatic seismic station on the Kamchatka peninsula itself
                        seems, in the opinion of Soviet scientists, clearly unacceptable in view of
                        strong hindrances caused by the proximity of the ocean and strong volcanic
                        activity in the peninsula itself which will inevitably hamper normal
                        functioning of a station. It appears to us that thus we could consider as
                        agreed upon also the question of the location of automatic seismic stations
                        for the Central Asian and Far Eastern zones of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government having consulted its specialists came to the conclusion
                        that it is quite enough to install three automatic seismic stations on the
                        territory of the Soviet Union. The more so that in your message, Mr.
                        President, a possibility is envisaged of setting up automatic seismic
                        stations on territories adjacent to the seismic zones in the Soviet Union—on
                        the Hokkaido, in Pakistan and Afghanistan, naturally with the consent of
                        respective governments.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government has named definite areas for the location of automatic
                        seismic stations on the territory of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>. Moreover, Mr. President, taking into account your wishes
                        we agree to relocate two stations to new places. We are entitled to expect
                        therefore that your side also will name definite areas where such stations
                        should be set up on the territory of the U.S. and that in reaching an
                        agreement on the sites where stations are to be placed the American side
                        will take into account our wishes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, we are convinced that all conditions exist now for reaching an
                        agreement also on the question of inspection. It is known that all the
                        recent time we heard not once from the Western side—agree <pb n="249"
                            xml:id="pg_249" facs="0271"/>in principle to inspection and then the
                        road to agreement will open. We believed and we continue to believe now
                        that, in general, inspection is not necessary and if we give our consent to
                        an annual quota of 2-3 inspections this is done solely for the purpose of
                        removing the remaining differences for the sake of reaching agreement.</p>
                    <p>As you see we have made a serious step in your direction. The quota of
                        inspections on the territory of each of the nuclear powers that we propose
                        is sufficient. Indeed, in the negotiations your representatives themselves
                        recognized that there is no need to verify all or a greater part of a
                        significant suspicious phenomena to restrain the states from attempts to
                        violate the treaty. And they gave figures of annual inspections practically
                        equaling the quota proposed by us. Naturally it is most reasonable to carry
                        out inspection in seismic areas where the biggest number of unidentified
                        seismic phenomena may occur. However if you consider it necessary we have no
                        objection to inspection being carried out also in non-seismic areas provided
                        such inspections are conducted within the annual quota indicated by us.</p>
                    <p>I noticed that in your reply you agree with the necessity of taking
                        reasonable measures of precaution which would exclude a possibility of using
                        inspection trips and visits to automatic seismic stations for the purpose of
                        obtaining intelligence data. Of course, in carrying out on-site inspection
                        there can be circumstances when in the area designated for inspection there
                        will be some object of defense importance. Naturally, in such a case it will
                        be necessary to take appropriate measures which would exclude a possibility
                        to cause damage to the interests of security of the state on the territory
                        of which inspection is carried out. In this respect I fully agree with the
                        considerations expressed in your message.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, in your message you suggest that our representatives meet in
                        New York or in Geneva for a brief preliminary consideration of some of the
                        problems you touched upon. We have no objections to such meeting of our
                        representatives. The Soviet Government for that purpose appointed N.T.
                        Fedorenko, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Permanent Representative to
                        the U.N., and S.K. Tsarapkin, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        Representative to the 18-Nation Disarmament Committee, who could meet with

                        assumption that meetings of our representatives should lead already in the
                        very near future to agreement on questions still unsettled so that upon the
                        reopening of the 18-Nation [Disarmament] Committee Session our
                        representatives could inform it that the road to the conclusion of agreement
                        banning all nuclear weapons tests is open.</p>

                            <item><p>“First. In past conversations we have spoken in a fairly
                                    detailed manner about the situation around Cuba. As we
                                    understand from statements coming from Washington, President
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> is convinced
                                    that implementation of the agreement reached during resolution
                                    of the Caribbean crisis is the course to be followed. We accord
                                    statements such as this an appropriate degree of respect,
                                    especially when they express the opinion of the President. For
                                    my part, I can confirm that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S.
                                        Khrushchev</persName> is also convinced that this course is
                                    correct.</p>
                                <p>It would of course be good if we could bring our discussions on
                                    the Cuban question to an end by means of an exchange of mutual
                                    assurances. But it seems that the time for that has not yet
                                    arrived—neither of us can say that everything here has turned
                                    out well. I would like to add, so to speak in hot pursuit of
                                    this theme, a few words about recent incidents along the Cuban
                                    coast—attacks on Cuban ports by armed vessels of emigrant Cuban
                                    riff-raff and gunfire from these vessels aimed at the Soviet
                                    merchant ships L'gov and Baku.</p>
                                <p>The Soviet Government has already expressed in diplomatic notes
                                    its views on these piratic attacks. It is nevertheless
                                    appropriate to dwell on this question in our present discussion,
                                    for, as we both know, contacts through confidential channels
                                    played a significant role in the resolution of certain aspects
                                    of the Caribbean crisis.</p>
                                <p>First of all, one cannot fail to note that the continuing armed
                                    attacks on the Cuban coast could not have taken place, and this
                                    is clear to everyone, unless they had been encouraged in the
                                        <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>.</p>
                                <p>It is true that it can be said that the Government of the United
                                    States does not approve of such actions and that they take place
                                    almost without its knowledge. I thus expect that you will now
                                    refer to statements by the <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251"
                                        facs="0273"/>Department of State in this regard. We are of
                                    course already aware of them. But what is the primary idea
                                    behind these statements? Apparently that the <gloss
                                        target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> is against 'brief attacks on
                                    Cuba' because they are said to be 'ineffective.' Those who have
                                    read these documents could interpret them to mean that if the
                                    attacks on Cuba were more solidly prepared and more 'effective,'
                                    that would not be at all bad.</p>
                                <p>We also cannot fail to point out that all statements and
                                    explanations made by representatives of the Government of the
                                    United States after the attacks on our ships and on the Cuban
                                    ports contain efforts to deny U.S. responsibility for these
                                    criminal attacks.</p>
                                <p>Allow me to say to you, however, that the U.S. cannot evade this
                                    responsibility. The whole world knows that the bases of the
                                    Cuban emigrant counter-revolutionaries are in Florida and Puerto
                                    Rico, and that, as before, the Central Intelligence Agency
                                    provides sustenance and all their needs to these renegades. The
                                    political ground for these bandit-like strikes is prepared by
                                    calls similar to those that rang out, in particular, during a
                                    parade by traitors to the Cuban people last December in Miami.
                                    The attacks on the Soviet vessels L'gov and Baku have revealed,
                                    more than anything else in the recent past, the grave danger
                                    these policies pose for world peace.</p>
                                <p>As one who is embroiled on a daily basis with the political life
                                    of the American capital, I cannot overlook an obvious fact. When
                                    the State Department issued its statement on March 19, <note
                                        n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">For text of this statement, see
                                        Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, April
                                        8, 1963, pp. 520-521.</note> the leaders of the Cuban
                                    counter-revolutionaries held a press conference, here in
                                    Washington, in which they boasted about having carried out armed
                                    raids on the Cuban coast and their objective as having been the
                                    killing of Soviet military personnel. As far as we are aware,
                                    you, as Attorney General, have responsibility for the
                                    investigation of the circumstances surrounding this matter. It
                                    is to be hoped that as a result those guilty will receive due
                                    punishment in order to discourage others who might plot new and
                                    dangerous adventures.</p>
                                <p>It is perhaps not superfluous to remind you that even during the
                                    most difficult moments of the crisis around Cuba there were no
                                    shots fired on Soviet vessels, for everyone understood well
                                    where that could take the world. One should think that that
                                    understanding is not lost on today as well.</p>
                                <p>Of course, the Soviet Government and <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                        >N. S. Khrushchev</persName> personally have taken note of
                                    the joint statement by the Departments of State and Justice on
                                    March 30 concerning several measures in regard to Cuban
                                        emigrants.<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3">For text of the joint
                                        statement, see ibid., April 22, 1963, pp. 600-601.</note> If
                                    these measures are in fact aimed at putting an end to the
                                    bandit-like provocations of these dangerous adventurists, then
                                    that will <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0274"/>deserve a
                                    positive evaluation. The future will show if that is the case
                                    and if these measures are those that should be carried out to
                                    prevent new tensions in the Caribbean.</p>
                                <p>In our previous discussions you touched on several aspects of the
                                    Cuban question which you said complicated the President's
                                    situation in light of the approaching election campaign. You
                                    know that we take into account, to the degree we can, the
                                    President's situation, and in a number of instances we have
                                    accommodated his wishes. The Soviet Government not only
                                    faithfully and strictly is carrying out the agreement on the
                                    Caribbean crisis, but has undertaken steps which go even further
                                    than required by the responsibilities it has assumed. You
                                    yourself noted that the Government of the U.S. understands that
                                    the Soviet Government is acting in a spirit of good will in
                                    matters which have been agreed with the U.S. or about which the
                                    U.S. has been informed.</p>
                                <p>But it is necessary to emphasize that pressure and threats are
                                    not appropriate means with which to achieve any result; they
                                    produce only a counterreaction. Take only the following
                                    question: we are removing our military personnel from Cuba, in
                                    considerable numbers, but we are doing that not because the U.S.
                                    is exerting pressure on us but rather because we consider for
                                    our troops to remain in Cuba would not be to put them to
                                    effective use. We have removed several times more people than
                                    the figures bandied about in the U.S. press. We have not given
                                    you a specific number, for if we had done so, you would have
                                    immediately presented that as our giving you an accounting. You
                                    would have blared out through all channels that you had forced
                                    us to do so. We respond adversely to such methods, which you
                                    have tried to use in similar circumstances. We reject them.</p>
                                <p>To be frank, as we are as a matter of principle in these
                                    confidential contacts, it seems somewhat one-sided when the
                                    problems and difficulties the President encounters in carrying
                                    out his policy toward Cuba are blamed on the Soviet Union or on
                                    the Republic of Cuba. But in fact the roots of these problems,
                                    as we have repeatedly emphasized, lie elsewhere—in a policy
                                    which announces that its objective is to remove, by any means
                                    necessary, overt or covert, the new social structure which has
                                    established itself in Cuba, although the right to establish
                                    order in one's own home belongs only to the people of that
                                    nation and to no one else.</p>
                                <p>On the one hand, we hear assurances that the President of the
                                    U.S. intends to uphold the agreement reached during resolution
                                    of the crisis in the Caribbean, and that despite pressures on
                                    him to do so he will not allow himself to be pushed onto the
                                    dangerous road of possible military confrontation with the
                                    Soviet Union. On the other, in addition to the continuing
                                    attacks on the Cuban coast I already mentioned, measures are
                                    being taken to suffocate the economy of Cuba, break off its
                                    commercial <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0275"/>trade, and
                                    erect some sort of police line around Cuba that would fence Cuba
                                    off from the other countries of the western hemisphere.</p>
                                <p>I will try to explain our understanding of why the President is
                                    experiencing the difficulties you mentioned by use of the
                                    following example. When we shot down the U-2 piloted by the
                                    airman Powers, then-President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                        >Eisenhower</persName> experienced substantial difficulties
                                    both domestically and in the international arena. And what was
                                    the primary cause of <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                        >Eisenhower</persName>'s ‘difficulties’? If he had not
                                    dispatched American aircraft on spy flights over the territory
                                    of a sovereign nation—in this instance the Soviet Union—he would
                                    have been spared the ‘difficulties’ of that time.</p>
                                <p>If I speak now of these quite sensitive issues, I do so only
                                    because you yourself introduced them. Of course, I will not
                                    debate with you, by dint of your position the top lawyer in the
                                    U.S., matters of flexibility or precision in statements of this
                                    nature. What I wish to do is to emphasize a fairly simple idea,
                                    that the truest path to ensuring that no 'complications' arise
                                    in connection with Cuba is strict and conscientious
                                    implementation of the United Nations Charter; that is, carrying
                                    out a policy of non-interference in the affairs of other states
                                    and respect for their sovereignty and independence.</p>
                                <p>It is indeed in strict implementation by our Governments of the
                                    Charter of the U.N. as well as of the additional obligations we
                                    assumed during resolution of the crisis in the Caribbean that
                                    lies a good opportunity, in our view, to create conditions, day
                                    by day and step by step, for a strengthening of trust and mutual
                                    understanding between the Soviet Government and the Government
                                    of the U.S., and personally between <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                        >N.S. Khrushchev</persName> and President <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KJF2">J. Kennedy</persName>, the necessity of
                                    which you, as a person close to the President, have often
                                    discussed in our meetings.</p>
                            </item>
                            <item>
                                <p><hi rend="italic">Second</hi>. In our previous discussions we did
                                    not avoid, as you will remember, the issue of a ban on nuclear
                                    weapon tests. This problem, it is true, occupies the minds not
                                    only of government officials but also that of the common man;
                                    for even if the latter is far from the making of policy, he is
                                    nevertheless concerned about the air he breathes and that his
                                    children and grandchildren will have to breathe.</p>
                                <p>Your comments that the President sincerely wants an agreement
                                    banning nuclear tests, and that he has children whom he loves,
                                    were transmitted, as you asked, to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                        >N.S. Khrushchev</persName>. I can say in reply that
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName> fully
                                    understands motives of a purely personal nature, which,
                                    naturally, should strengthen the resolve of every government
                                    official to do everything possible to end test explosions of
                                    atom and hydrogen bombs. As you of course know, <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName> has children,
                                    grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren, and personal
                                    motives are no less close to his heart.</p>
                                <p>You have said that President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1"
                                        >Kennedy</persName> considers, in principle, that a treaty
                                    banning nuclear tests is a very important step toward
                                    normalization <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0276"/>of the
                                    international situation and bettering relations between the
                                    Soviet Union and the U.S. You know that the Soviet Government
                                    and personally <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S.
                                        Khrushchev</persName> share this view. It followed from what
                                    you have said that the President is ready to use all his
                                    authority in the country to achieve ratification of such a
                                    treaty, and that it would be more convenient for the President
                                    were the treaty considered by the present session of
                                    Congress.</p>
                                <p>Such an effort would of course meet a most positive response from
                                    us. We in fact propose such an approach, which would make it
                                    possible to bring negotiations on a cessation of nuclear tests
                                    to a rapid conclusion.</p>
                                <p>You must understand us and our position. We understand your
                                    position well.<persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S.
                                        Khrushchev</persName> asked me to tell you that. Throughout
                                    the world, many people, and especially those who are
                                    professionally involved in nuclear weapons and their testing,
                                    know that national means are adequate to confirm that any
                                    nuclear explosion has taken place. And that has been proven in
                                    practice; whenever explosions have taken place in the Soviet
                                    Union you registered that fact and immediately made it public.
                                    We ascertain when you or other countries carry out explosions.
                                    One therefore asks, why is it not possible to come to an
                                    agreement banning all nuclear tests and to sign a corresponding
                                    treaty?</p>
                                <p>You explain this as caused by the internal conditions and
                                    specific problems existing in your country. We increasingly have
                                    to listen to you say that a treaty banning nuclear tests is
                                    facing an almost impassable barrier in the U.S. Senate if we do
                                    not make further concessions to the United States. You
                                    essentially put the problem that way in your statements. But is
                                    it not too much to expect from the Soviet Union that it agree to
                                    adjust its positions in the nuclear test ban negotiations in
                                    April to suit the bad mood of a Senator from Connecticut and in
                                    May that of a Senator from Arizona? We have in that way already
                                    conceded a great deal to the U.S. on verification of a test ban,
                                    taking into account the President's comments that were passed to
                                    us confidentially. But you must understand that in international
                                    negotiations it is states that participate, not individuals
                                    whose views for some reason may differ from the point of view of
                                    the participating governments. If governments are not able to
                                    raise themselves above narrow group interests expressed by
                                    unreasonable politicians within their own country, then they
                                    have totally deprived themselves of any chance of concluding
                                    international agreements, the usefulness of which they seem to
                                    recognize.</p>
                                <p>An analysis of the specific problems you mention shows that they
                                    are nothing more than two parties competing for the White House
                                    who are arguing whether to poison the air by nuclear explosions
                                    or not to poison it. And you want us to help one of the
                                    contesting sides, and to do so by making concessions. But why
                                    should we reward you for signing a test ban which, it would
                                    seem, should be in the interests of both sides equally, <pb
                                        n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0277"/>by allowing you, at the
                                    expense of Soviet interests, to engage in espionage on Soviet

                                <p>How are we to understand this, Mr.<persName>Kennedy</persName>?
                                    What kind of partnership is that? You want us to help you in
                                    this matter. Well, what if we do not do so, what harm will come
                                    to the Soviet Union if we reach no agreement? No more than to
                                    the U.S. If we conceded this to you we would in reality gain
                                    nothing, only lose. You would gain that which we lost, in
                                    addition to the opportunity to carry out espionage on the
                                    territory of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and plus
                                    the moral satisfaction of knowing that you pressured us from a
                                    position of strength and forced us to make further
                                    concessions.</p>
                                <p>Understand us, we cannot do that. We have already agreed to a
                                    minimum, and that in fact is not a minimum but rather a
                                    substantial maximum—2-3 inspections. And that, of course, we
                                    could not agree to interpret in such a manner that under the
                                    guise of these 2-3 inspections intelligence
                                    information-gathering could be carried out all over the
                                    territory of the Soviet Union, above ground and underground, in
                                    and on water, and by aerial observation to boot. These
                                    activities are not at all made necessary by the requirements for
                                    inspections. No, these demands are dictated by completely
                                    different intentions—the same ones that governed President
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>'s
                                    predecessor, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>,
                                    when he demanded the right to flights around the borders of the
                                    Soviet Union and to send U-2 spy planes into our air space.</p>
                                <p>What kind of policy is that? The Soviet Union, after all, is no
                                    weaker than you, and U.S. Government officials have more than
                                    once in their statements recognized that we are equally
                                    powerful. But if you consider the Soviet Union an equal, then
                                    why carry out such a policy, why make such demands on us? Such
                                    demands can only be made by the strong from the weak, based not
                                    on right, but on force.</p>
                                <p>And the time has also passed when colonial powers could, using
                                    force, seize colonies. The colonial powers are still more
                                    powerful than the countries over whom they once held sway, but,
                                    as a result of changing conditions in the world—and they
                                    themselves would have to admit this—they have had to leave them
                                    while in one piece, because if they had not they would have left
                                    them not in the best of health.</p>
                                <p>Examples of this were demonstrated in Vietnam, and in Algeria.
                                    Now the struggle is being joined in other countries,
                                    particularly in the Indonesian region. One can point out many
                                    such examples which have shown that the departure of the
                                    colonial powers was not voluntary, but rather was made to avoid
                                    a kick in a certain area.</p>
                                <p>And you wish to talk to us in this manner and pressure us to make
                                    concessions that do not correspond to the balance of forces
                                    between us, to the present times nor to the position we occupy
                                    in the world. How is it possible to expect that we would agree
                                    to your demands? We cannot agree to them.</p>
                                <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0278"/>
                                <p>You said that your brother does not want to go down in history as
                                    a second Wilson if the Senate does not ratify a treaty banning
                                    nuclear tests, basing its action on the number of inspections
                                    the Soviet Union has offered. Neither do we wish for <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KJF2">J. Kennedy</persName> to become a second
                                    Wilson, and we are exercising maximum good will in the matter of
                                    a test ban. We sincerely wish that your brother enter history as
                                    the President of the United States of America who was able to
                                    place above all else the need for statesmanlike wisdom, and as
                                    the government official who, together with <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName>, wrote his name
                                    in the great book of peace.</p>
                                <p>If the President in fact wants to do something useful and
                                    establish a claim for his presidency to be noted by history, he
                                    will have to work against aggressive circles within the country,
                                    against all who urge irrational and aggressive policies. We are
                                    convinced that all people of sound mind in America want to live,
                                    to raise their children, and want good for themselves and their
                                    children, just as you contend do you and the President. Why then
                                    do you think that the American people will not support such
                                    healthy undertakings against that Rockefeller? The people can
                                    only gain from this, for that bunch of shameless people, or as
                                    you call them, crazies, is a small group, and in their
                                    overwhelming majority Americans are a healthy people that want
                                    to live, and can live for their children in the world together
                                    with other peoples. Why does the President not want to take
                                    advantage of this opportunity?</p>
                                <p>You in fact are moving the opposite way, trying to get from us
                                    even more significant concessions. You want us with our own
                                    concessions to satisfy Rockefeller and the other crazies who
                                    carry out a frantic and aggressive propaganda campaign against
                                    the Soviet Union. Understand us, we cannot do that, and
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName> asks
                                    that you pass that message to the President.</p>
                                <p>Can you, are you ready to move on a sound, equitable basis toward
                                    conclusion of a treaty, taking into account the concessions we
                                    have already made, though they were not required and had as
                                    their sole objective making it easier for the President to move
                                    the treaty through Congress? That was a sacrifice by our side,
                                    and we cannot, I repeat, do more.</p>
                                <p>The test ban treaty may or may not be signed. Whether or not
                                    really is of no significance to limitation of the arms race, for
                                    enough test explosions have already been carried out to perfect
                                    nuclear weapons. And as far as the future is concerned, new
                                    tests will add nothing, or almost nothing. But you should be
                                    clear on what will happen if there is no test ban agreement. You
                                    are now carrying out nuclear weapons tests at your test ranges
                                    in Nevada even after we have finished our series of nuclear
                                    explosions. And now the roar of a nuclear explosion has been
                                    heard in the Sahara. It is true, as they say, that in recent
                                    times dissimilarities in the architectural styles of the Elysee
                                    Palace and the White House have become more noticeable, but fact
                                    remains fact; France is your ally, and <pb n="257"

                                    nuclear devices. So, if there is no agreement and <gloss
                                        target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries continue testing,
                                    and if under these circumstances our scientists and military
                                    find it necessary to put the question of carrying out new tests
                                    in the Soviet Union before the Soviet Government, they of course
                                    will have to be allowed to do so.</p>
                                <p>It is clear that any new nuclear tests harm the people living on
                                    this earth. But what can we do? It is not our fault.
                                    Responsibility for that rests on your government. The fate of
                                    the agreement banning nuclear weapon tests rests today in the
                                    hands of the U.S. Government. What turn further negotiations now
                                    take depends on it, and on no one else: will they be swept away
                                    by a new wave of nuclear test explosions or crowned by the
                                    conclusion of a treaty the people have long waited for.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="italic">Third</hi>. I would like to touch on a question
                                    at this point that has already been the subject of a
                                    confidential exchange of opinion between <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName> and the
                                    President, and which in light of latest events is worthy of
                                    further attention. I refer to various plans for creating nuclear
                                    forces within the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                    framework which would include also states that at present do not
                                    have nuclear weapons.</p>
                                <p>We remember the explanations which were passed to us unofficially
                                    in the name of the President after his meeting in Nassau with
                                    Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName>.
                                    The President assured us that his main concern in deciding the
                                    Polaris transfer was to prevent, or at least delay, the
                                    development of national nuclear forces. It was also emphasized
                                    that practical implementation of this plan lay far in the
                                    future, and that it was necessary to win time for further
                                    efforts in the disarmament area.</p>
                                <p>We immediately gave our views on the Nassau agreement. As you
                                    know, President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>
                                    was informed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S.
                                        Khrushchev</persName> considered this agreement as yet
                                    another effort in the implementation of plans for nuclear
                                    weapons—weapons, mind you, when peoples expect from their
                                    governments and statesmen efforts in quite the opposite
                                    direction—to destroy national military machines and all means of
                                    killing people.</p>
                                <p>Events since Nassau have not only not lessened the accuracy of
                                    this evaluation but on the contrary have brought new
                                    confirmation of the danger these plans pose to peace. Whatever
                                    label is pasted on these planned nuclear forces of <gloss
                                        target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>—'multilateral' or
                                    'multinational', or both at the same time—the fact of the matter
                                    does not change. Whether the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>
                                    wants that to be the case or not, that is the nature of any
                                    plans that allow the 'unconsecrated' to get their hands on
                                    nuclear weapons; their implementation prepares the ground for
                                    other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members, and
                                    especially West German revanchists, to break their way into the
                                    nuclear club. That is not only our opinion. Many people in other
                                    countries share that view. Even, apparently, some statesmen in
                                        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> states themselves are
                                    not spared these concerns.</p>
                                <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0280"/>
                                <p>If only one country strays from the path along which the nuclear
                                    powers have traveled, and in one manner or another provides
                                    nuclear weapons to any one of its allies, then the nuclear arms
                                    race will embrace new countries and regions in a powerful surge,
                                    and it will be difficult to say where it will stop.</p>
                                <p>The West is now doing its calculations on how many additional
                                    fingers can be on nuclear weapon launch buttons, and at the same
                                    time is trying to prove that the risk of outbreak of a nuclear
                                    war will not increase. But arithmetic here can deceive. The
                                    danger of unleashing a thermonuclear war will steadily rise, and
                                    it will rise not just in proportion to the additional fingers on
                                    the launch triggers; it will be multiplied many times over by a
                                    thirst for revenge and perhaps by irresponsibility on the part
                                    of someone.</p>
                                <p>We would like to trust the statements of U.S. Government leaders
                                    that proliferation of nuclear weapons is not in U.S. interests.
                                    But they are difficult to reconcile with the fact that
                                    emissaries of the U.S. Government are now traveling from one
                                        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> capital to another
                                    strongly promoting plans to create a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                        >NATO</gloss> nuclear force.</p>
                                <p>You have said that the U.S. Government is fulfilling its promise
                                    to withdraw missiles from Turkey and Italy and that that would
                                    be completed during the first half of April. We of course greet
                                    liquidation of these bases. But put yourself in our place, and
                                    you will understand that from the standpoint of the security of
                                    the Soviet Union this is not liquidation of missile bases, but
                                    rather exchanging old weapons for more advanced. In place of
                                    having missiles aimed at us from land we will now have missiles
                                    of the latest model aimed at us from the seas that wash the
                                    shores of that land. That is how it will be if the
                                    Mediterranean, as is now being planned, is filled with nuclear
                                    submarines and surface vessels, armed with 'Polaris' missiles
                                    and cruising along the coasts of Italy and Turkey.</p>

                                    can be reached with the United States. During resolution of the
                                    crisis in the Caribbean, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S.
                                        Khrushchev</persName> in an exchange with President
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>, expressed
                                    the view—and the President shared his hope—that after the crisis
                                    was over efforts would be continued to resolve issues that are
                                    key to a liquidation of tension in the world and normalization
                                    of relations between our governments. But as soon as that crisis
                                    was over the President apparently forgot what he wanted, and now
                                    the United States, in the person of the President, is beginning,
                                    judging by all evidence, to test our resistance and to put
                                    pressure on us. We indignantly reject such policies. For this
                                    reason, we do not want to hear discussions about our having
                                    troops where it would be better if we did not have them, and we
                                    reject, with considerable displeasure, any claims of that sort.
                                    Our opportunities in the world should be equal to yours.</p>

                                <p>Why are your troops scattered throughout the world and you regard
                                    that as your right and obligation? Why do you consider that
                                    locating one country's military instructors in another country
                                    is a violation of international norms? On what right does that
                                    understanding turn? In any case not on the <gloss

                                    law.</p>
                                <p>If you want really good relations—and we want that very much—then
                                    let us proceed from the assumption, as <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName> told the
                                    President in Vienna, that our states are equally powerful and
                                    that we should have the same opportunities.</p>
                                <p>We long ago proposed and continue to propose that all troops be
                                    withdrawn from foreign territories to within their own borders.
                                    We propose that we conclude an agreement on that basis. We would
                                    greet such an agreement, and then we would have no troops or
                                    instructors beyond our own borders. Now, when we sell or
                                    transfer armaments, we also send troops to give instruction on
                                    how to handle these weapons. But we are ready to agree even not
                                    to do that if you take upon yourself a similar obligation.</p>
                                <p>In a word, do not try to pressure us or urge us to do anything
                                    that you yourselves do not do, because that insults us. We are
                                    very sensitive about such matters.</p>
                                <p>We have frequently heard judgments that we should not leave
                                    surface-to-air missiles in Cuba, for the Cubans may shoot down
                                    an American intelligence-gathering aircraft and then something
                                    untoward will happen. Tell the President that if that occurs,
                                    then the improbable will have occurred. You want us to
                                    understand your pressuring us to allow you to penetrate Cuban
                                    air space with your intelligence-gathering aircraft, but we
                                    react to this with indignation, for you are violating elementary
                                    norms of international relations and the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                        >UN</gloss> Charter. You want us to recognize your right to
                                    violate that Charter and international norms, but we cannot do
                                    that. We can only confirm to you that we are carrying out the
                                    obligations and assurances we undertook before, and gave to, the
                                    Cuban Government that in the case of an attack on Cuba we would
                                    support her with the means at our disposal. It can be no other
                                    way. You yourselves are forcing us to make that statement, and
                                    we would rather not make it, because it will not make
                                    normalization of our relations easier. We would like to improve
                                    them, make them good. But that depends on you.</p>
                                <p>Do not try to force us to accept your policies, for that will
                                    produce a counterreaction—that is, you will receive the same in
                                    reply.</p>
                                <p>The most reasonable thing for the President to do—and <persName

                                    mankind—is to stop flights over Cuban territory before the
                                    Cubans shoot down an aircraft, for if they continue they will
                                    surely do so. If the President wants a crisis, and has in mind
                                    using the downing of an American intelligence aircraft as an

                                    believe it is in the interests of the United States to carry out
                                    a policy that may return us to a crisis we have already once
                                    survived. But if a new crisis is unleashed it may be impossible
                                    this time to reach the reasonable resolution that we found then,
                                    for the basis on which the agreement was reached last year has
                                    been shaken. All this has to be taken into account.</p>
                                <p>And we are not even addressing the question, a minor one for us
                                    from the material standpoint but one of great significance as a
                                    matter of principle in international relations, of pressure by
                                    the United States on its allies in regard to trade with the
                                    Soviet Union. Your representative in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                        >NATO</gloss> insists that sale of steel pipe to the Soviet
                                    Union be halted. Is that important for the Soviet Union? Not at
                                    all. And what did you get for your efforts? Only West Germany
                                    obeyed you, and that only because you support their position in
                                    the German question, particularly in regard to West Berlin. But
                                    for that reason only. Not selling us pipe is not in their
                                    interest. It is no accident that even your own allies did not
                                    support you. You pressured them to ignore their own interests,
                                    knowing that it was advantageous for them to trade with us.</p>
                                <p>Even your allies do not understand your policies. Where is good
                                    will, where are good relations or any indication of a reasonable
                                    approach to righting relations between our states? We do not see
                                    them.</p>
                                <p>If you really want to improve relations, we are ready. Let us
                                    sign a treaty banning nuclear weapon tests on the basis of
                                    findings approved and confirmed by scientists free from outside
                                    pressure.</p>
                                <p>Let us at long last finally liquidate the remains of World War
                                    II, resolve the issue of a German peace treaty, and on that
                                    basis normalize the situation in West Berlin. We do not expect
                                    any acquisitions as a result, and no harm will come to you. The
                                    situation in West Berlin should be normalized by recognizing
                                    existing circumstances—and nothing more. We do not even demand
                                    withdrawal of foreign troops, but want only that their presence
                                    be on another basis, that the troops be of a different
                                    composition and that they be under the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                        >UN</gloss> flag.</p>
                                <p>However, you do not want to do this, even though you lose nothing
                                    and we gain nothing. But if we could conclude such an agreement
                                    it would have a big payoff—the whole world would gain, and
                                    better conditions would be created for disarmament negotiations.
                                    After all, without resolution of the German question—you know
                                    this yourself, and I ask you to pass this to the President from
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName>—no
                                    reasonable resolution to the problem of disarmament will be
                                    found. As long as remnants of World War II are preserved that
                                    constantly remind us of their presence, we and you will have to
                                    pay for our military forces and increase our ability to destroy
                                    each other. How, under such circumstances, <pb n="261"
                                        xml:id="pg_261" facs="0283"/>can we reach an agreement on
                                    disarmament? An agreement on disarmament must be based above all
                                    on trust.</p>
                                <p>And what kind of trust can there be when <persName
                                        corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Malinovsky take
                                    turns speaking, each time annihilating each other? Why do
                                    that?Malinovsky has no choice, because <persName
                                        corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> speaks, and not only
                                        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. You have
                                    now alot of these orators, the so-called specialists in military
                                    affairs. We have to reply, but who stands to gain? The
                                    militarists and monopolists making millions on the production of
                                    armaments. Only they stand to gain.</p>
                                <p>But if you do not now understand that all of this must be brought
                                    to an end, well, then we will continue to live this way. Of
                                    course, no good agreement will be reached in such a situation.
                                    One side cannot produce that which depends on two.</p>
                                <p>In Vienna we were told that the President had just come into the
                                    White House. A year has passed, two—and now you say that the
                                    election campaign has begun. So, the first two years, the
                                    President was a newcomer in the White House, learning the ropes,
                                    and the next two years are devoted to preparation for new
                                    elections. So it turns out that in the first two years the
                                    President cannot decide key, vitally important questions and in
                                    the following two years he cannot decide them because he might
                                    otherwise, we are told, lose the election campaign.</p>
                                <p>This is a tragedy, but it is the essence of capitalism, of a
                                    classical capitalist contradiction. And it is America that
                                    appears to us as the glaring example, in our Marxist
                                    understanding of things. We do not force this understanding on
                                    you; we simply express it.</p>
                                <p>But we take into account the times in which we live, and
                                    understand what the situation now is. One will have to live in
                                    this manner until better times come, and we are certain that
                                    better times will come, and then we will have mutual
                                    understanding.</p>

                            <item><hi rend="italic">Fifth</hi>. In a recent conversation you touched
                                on the possibility of a meeting between Chairman of the Council of
                                Ministers of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss><persName
                                    corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName> and President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>. Our point of
                                view regarding the significance of summit meetings is well known.
                                The Soviet Government is a convinced advocate of those methods of
                                carrying out foreign policy that promise the best results in
                                resolving current problems. And reason demands that these problems,
                                some of which you mentioned last time, be resolved at the
                                negotiating table.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>As before, we proceed from the assumption that such meetings can be useful if
                        both sides are equally interested in a positive result. We do not believe
                        that one can somehow separate the interest of the two sides in such a
                        meeting, suggesting that, for example, the U.S. is less interested in it
                        than the Soviet Union, or vice versa. And therefore it would seem
                        inappropriate for either side to put forward any considerations which could
                        be construed as preconditions for such a meeting. Interest in such a meeting
                            <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0284"/>can only be shared and
                        inseparable, of course, if both sides actually strive to unite their forces
                        in the interest of strengthening peace.</p>
                    <p>We for quite some time now have not given answers to questions which have
                        remained open during the course of our discussions, and have ourselves not
                        taken initiative in our confidential messages to the President, because
                        American actions are already causing us to lose confidence in the usefulness
                        of this channel. We wanted you to know that. If, nevertheless, we again
                        decide to turn to this opportunity for confidential transmission of our
                        ideas to the President, we will do so in the hope that it will result in
                        better understanding by the President of the position of the Soviet Union
                        and its leader, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S. Khrushchev</persName>.”</p>
                    <p>Decide for yourself, taking into account the actual situation in which your
                        discussion with <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">R. Kennedy</persName> is to take
                        place, how best to carry out this conversation: whether to make the
                        statement all at once or do it part by part. In either case you should leave
                        a copy of the text with <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">R.

                    <p>We exchanged some pleasantries. He told me that Norman Cousins had asked to

                        document was particularly long—approximately 25 pages. It was ostensibly to

                            >Khrushchev</persName> to the President.</p>
                    <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0285"/>
                    <p>The paper made five or six major points, among which were the following:</p>
                    <p>Mr.<persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> knew that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> has children and is
                        concerned about the future. He, Mr.<persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                            >Khrushchev</persName>, has children, grandchildren and
                        great-grandchildren. He is also concerned about the future. It should be
                        clearly understood, however, that the Soviet Union will not go above their
                        offer of two or three inspection sites. There was absolutely no need to go
                        above that figure as our scientists had clearly demonstrated.</p>
                    <p>There could not be secret testing without the other country knowing about it.
                        We knew everytime the Soviet Union tested as they knew everytime we
                        tested.</p>
                    <p>As for obtaining the approval of the United States Senate for a treaty which
                        contained provisions for only two or three sites, if President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> wanted to put his prestige on the
                        line and make the necessary effort, ratification could be obtained.
                            Mr.<persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> was tired of
                        hearing first about objections from the Senator from Connecticut and then
                        objections from the Senator from Arizona.</p>
                    <p>The United States is run by capitalists who are interested only in war
                        profits. They are the ones that were dictating policy. If President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> was not as concerned
                        about the Rockefellers and these capitalists then he would take this step
                        for world peace.</p>
                    <p>Further, who did we think we were in the United States trying to dictate to
                        the Soviet Union? All that was needed were two or three inspection sites and
                        we were trying to obtain a greater number in order to commit espionage. In
                        these efforts we were treating the Soviet Union as inferiors—as if we could
                        dictate to them. The United States had better learn that the Soviet Union
                        was as strong as the United States and did not enjoy being treated as a
                        second class power. (Virtually, these same words were repeated later on in
                        the letter. This was the thread or theme that ran through the whole
                        document.)</p>
                    <p>Another point that was made was a sharp and bitter criticism about the raids
                        that had taken place against Russian ships. These were piratical acts and
                        the United States must take responsibility for them. It isn't possible to
                        believe that if we really wanted to stop these raids that we could not do
                        so. They were glad to hear of the steps that are being taken lately but in
                        the last analysis the specific acts, namely, the arrests that we made would
                        be the criteria by which they would judge our sincerity. The Soviet Union
                        questions whether in fact we wish to end these attacks for our criticism of
                        them has been not that they were wrong but that they were ineffective. The
                        clear implication was that if the raids had been effective they would have
                        had our approval.</p>
                    <p>Further, our efforts to isolate Cuba, to build a virtual wall around it, was
                        a barbaric act. Our actions to stifle Cuba's commerce and to create <pb
                            n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0286"/>economic difficulties and isolate
                        her from her neighbors in Latin America were completely unwarranted. The
                        support given to counter-revolutionaries and the statements to the barbaric
                        mercenaries in Miami by the President were also bitterly criticized.</p>
                    <p>The document also stated that the President should understand the continued
                        pressure on the Soviet Union for the withdrawal of troops from Cuba was not
                        going to be effective. The Soviet Union does not respond to pressure. As a
                        matter of fact, they had already withdrawn twice as many troops as the
                        largest number that had appeared in the newspapers here in the United
                        States. However, he said that he was going to refuse to give the actual
                        number that had been withdrawn because then public statements would be
                        issued that they had been withdrawn because of pressure by the United States
                        and “trumpets would have been blown” by us.</p>
                    <p>This letter took note of the criticism of the fact that the Russian SAM sites
                        remained within Cuba. The author of the letter wanted us to know that those
                        ground-air missiles were going to stay in Cuba for the protection of Cuban
                        people.</p>
                    <p>The overflights that were taking place were deeply resented by the Soviet
                        Union and by Cuba. He then went on to say clearly and distinctly that these
                        U-2 planes would be shot down and that this had better be clearly understood
                        in the United States. The U-2 plane that <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> sent over the Soviet Union was shot down and they
                        had better understand the same thing would be done in those flights over
                        Cuba.</p>
                    <p>The document then returned to the theme that we were treating the Soviet
                        Union as inferiors; that this could not be continued; that the statements
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Malinovski were
                        making were not contributing to peaceful understanding; that Malinovski's
                        statements were brought about by <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName>'s warlike pronouncements. The United States was
                        interested only in making profits from munitions, building up their efforts
                        to dominate the world through counterrevolutionary activity. We were run by
                        capitalists and we should understand that we could not push the Soviet Union
                        around. He also expressed deep concern about the deployment of the Polaris
                        submarines in the Mediterranean, replacing the Jupiter missiles in Turkey
                        and Italy.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the document it said that Mr.<persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                            >Khrushchev</persName> had felt in the past that this confidential
                        exchange had been helpful but he said it had not been used lately because of
                        the provocative statements that had been made by representatives of the
                        United States Government which were offensive to the Soviet Union. However
                        if President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> wanted to reopen
                        this area of contact he would be glad to accept it. He also said that as far
                        as a meeting between <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> and
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> he thought that
                        that might be helpful. This was, however, left in rather enigmatic
                        terms.</p>
                    <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0287"/>
                    <p>After I read the document I returned it to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                            >Dobrynin</persName>. I pointed out to him that I had met with him
                        frequently and that he had never talked like this before. He said that was
                        correct. I asked what was the explanation for this document and he said that
                        I should understand that it came from the Soviet Union. I said it
                        demonstrated a complete lack of understanding of the United States and
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> and that I thought
                        it was so insulting and rude to the President and to the United States that
                        I would neither accept it nor transmit its message. I said if they had a
                        message of that kind to deliver it should be delivered formally through the
                        State Department and not through me. I said that during our conversations in
                        the past we attempted to work out matters on a mutually satisfactory basis.
                        I said we might disagree but I never insulted or offended him or his country
                        or Mr.<persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. I said I felt that
                        was the only basis for any kind of relationship. I said I thought this kind
                        of document did not further that effort or our mutual interests and I
                        repeated that if they intended to transmit that kind of message that it
                        should be done through the State Department. He said he could understand my
                        position. He was obviously embarrassed.<note n="4" xml:id="d94fn4"><persName

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Chairman</hi>: It has been some time since I
                        have written you directly, and I think it may be helpful to have some
                        exchange of views in this private channel. As we have both earlier agreed,
                        it is of great importance that we should try to understand each other
                        clearly, so that we can avoid unnecessary dangers or obstacles to progress
                        in the effort for peaceful agreements.</p>
                    <p>On the negotiations for a nuclear test ban, I fear that there may have been
                        an honest misunderstanding between us. You and your represent-atives, <pb
                            n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0288"/>on a number of occasions, have made
                        clear your belief that on our side there had been some indication last year
                        of a readiness to accept the number of inspections which you proposed in
                        your message of December 19.<note n="1" xml:id="d95fn1"><ref target="#d85"
                                >Document 85</ref>.</note> I know that the United States Government
                        never adopted any such position, and I have the most direct assurances from
                        all my senior representatives that no such American position was ever
                        indicated by them. But I have respect for your representatives, too, and so
                        believe that there was an honest misunderstanding on this point. I can
                        assure you that we are not engaged in any effort to impose a one-sided or
                        arbitrary view on this matter. We continue to believe that an agreement to
                        end nuclear testing is deeply in the interest of our two countries. Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> and I hope to be
                        able to make new suggestions to you on this matter very soon.</p>
                    <p>A closely connected question is the spread of nuclear weapons, and on this
                        question the American position remains as it has been. We are strongly
                        against the development of additional national nuclear capabilities, and the
                        plans and proposals which we are considering for the future management of
                        the nuclear forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are all based
                        upon this principle. I regret that the formal communication which
                            Mr.<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> passed to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> a few days ago <note n="2"
                            xml:id="d95fn2">The note, April 8, was transmitted in telegram 2527 from

                        reaches quite different conclusions as to the meaning of these events. I
                        shall not reply to that paper here, but let me say clearly that you can rely
                        upon our continued and determined opposition to the spread of national
                        nuclear forces.</p>
                    <p>Neither the multinational nor the multilateral forces we are considering will
                        increase the dangers of diffusion. Both are intended to reduce those
                        dangers. The plan for a <hi rend="italic">multinational</hi> nuclear force
                        implies no change in present arrangements for the ultimate political control
                        of existing nuclear weapons systems, and it is a fundamental principle in
                        our support for a new <hi rend="italic">multilateral</hi> force <hi
                            rend="italic">that no such force could ever be used without the consent
                            of the United States</hi>. The concept of this force is therefore
                        exactly opposite to that of independent national nuclear forces, and the
                        opposition to it in the West comes precisely from those who would prefer the
                        expansion of independent nuclear forces.</p>
                    <p>Although together we found workable arrangements for ending the very
                        dangerous crisis which was created when strategic weapons were introduced
                        into Cuba last year, I am sure we can agree that the situation in that
                        island is not yet satisfactory or reassuring to those who care for the peace
                        of the Caribbean. Although the recent withdrawal of a number of your forces
                        has been an important contribution to the reduction of tension, <pb n="267"
                            xml:id="pg_267" facs="0289"/>the continued presence of Soviet forces in
                        Cuba can never be regarded with equanimity by the people of this Hemisphere
                        and therefore further withdrawals of such forces can only be helpful.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, we on our side have been endeavoring to reduce tension in this
                        area in a number of ways. For example, the fundamental justification of our
                        practice of peaceful observation of Cuba is precisely that it is necessary
                        to prevent further increase in tension and a repetition of the dangers of
                        last fall. Without such peaceful observation in 1962, this Hemisphere would
                        have been confronted with intolerable danger, and the people of the
                        Hemisphere could not now accept a situation in which they were without
                        adequate information on the situation in Cuba. It is for this reason that
                        this peaceful observation must continue, and that any interference with it
                        from Cuba would necessarily evoke whatever response was necessary to retain
                        it.</p>
                    <p>We are also aware of the tensions unduly created by recent private attacks on
                        your ships in Caribbean waters; and we are taking action to halt those
                        attacks which are in violation of our laws, and obtaining the support of the
                        British Government in preventing the use of their Caribbean islands for this
                        purpose. The efforts of this Government to reduce tensions have, as you
                        know, aroused much criticism from certain quarters in this country. But
                        neither such criticism nor the opposition of any sector of our society will
                        be allowed to determine the policies of this Government. In particular, I
                        have neither the intention nor the desire to invade Cuba; I consider that it
                        is for the Cuban people themselves to decide their destiny. I am determined
                        to continue with policies which will contribute to peace in the
                        Caribbean.</p>
                    <p>Another area in which there has been a flare-up of danger in recent days is
                        Laos. My representatives will be in touch with yours on this problem, and I
                        am sure that we both have a clear interest in preventing the breakdown of
                        the agreement worked out so carefully last year. We continue to put great
                        reliance on your own pledge of support for a neutral and independent Laos.
                        Neither of us can wish for a direct test of force in that remote country,
                        and in the instance it appears that the provocation has come from a side in
                        which your influence can be more effective than ours.</p>
                    <p>There are other issues and problems before us, but perhaps I have said enough
                        to give you a sense of my own current thinking on these matters. Let me now
                        also offer the suggestion that it might be helpful if some time in May I
                        should send a senior personal representative to discuss these and other
                        matters informally with you. The object would not be formal negotiations,
                        but a fully frank, informal exchange of views, arranged in such a way as to
                        receive as little attention as possible. If this thought is appealing to
                        you, please let me know your views on the most convenient time.</p>
                    <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0290"/>
                    <p>In closing, I want again to send my warm personal wishes to you and all your
                        family. These are difficult and dangerous times in which we live, and both
                        you and I have grave responsibilities to our families and to all of mankind.
                        The pressures from those who have a less patient and peaceful outlook are
                        very great—but I assure you of my own determination to work at all times to
                        strengthen world peace.<note n="3" xml:id="d95fn3">Printed from an unsigned

                            <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName>:</p>
                    <p>Begin verbatim text.</p>
                    <p>“Dear Mr. Chairman,</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>You will recall that in February and March, 1962, we had some
                            correspondence about the Geneva disarmament conference, and in
                            particular about the possibility of reaching agreement on the text of a
                            treaty to ban nuclear tests. Both President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName>/Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
                                >Macmillan</persName> and I pledged ourselves to take a personal
                            interest in the progress of this conference on which so many of the
                            hopes of mankind have been fixed. Last October we both indicated in
                            messages to you our intention to devote renewed efforts to the problem
                            of disarmament with particular reference to the proliferation of nuclear
                            weapons and the banning of nuclear tests.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Since then the Geneva meeting has continued but it has not reached the
                            point of definite agreement. Nevertheless, some encouraging advance has
                            been made. For example, your acceptance of the principle of on-the-spot
                            verification of unidentified events has been of great value. Equally,
                            the Western countries have been able to reduce the number <pb n="269"
                                xml:id="pg_269" facs="0291"/>of annual inspections for which they
                            felt it essential to ask, from about twenty down to seven. The
                            difference remaining is of course real and substantial, if only because
                            it presents in practical form the effects of two different lines of
                            reasoning. At the same time the actual difference between the three
                            inspections which you have proposed and the seven for which we are
                            asking, important though this is, should not be impossible to resolve.
                            As regards the automatic seismic stations, the difference between us
                            appears to be fairly narrow.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>We all have a duty to consider what are the needs of security; but we
                            also have a duty to humanity. President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName>/Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
                                >Macmillan</persName> and I therefore believe that we ought to make
                            a further serious attempt by the best available means to see if we
                            cannot bring this matter to a conclusion with your help.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>We know that it is argued that a nuclear tests agreement, although
                            valuable and welcome especially in respect of atmospheric tests, will
                            not by itself make a decisive contribution to the peace and security of
                            the world. There are, of course, other questions between us which are
                            also of great importance; but the question of nuclear tests does seem to
                            be one on which agreement might now be reached. The mere fact of an
                            agreement on one question will inevitably help to create confidence and
                            so facilitate other settlements. In addition, it is surely possible that
                            we might be able to proceed rapidly to specific and fruitful discussions
                            about the non-dissemination of nuclear power, leading to an agreement on
                            this subject. Such an agreement, if it was reasonably well supported by
                            other countries, would seem to us likely to have a profound effect upon
                            the present state of tension in the world. If it proved possible to move
                            promptly to an agreement on nuclear weapons and on the proliferation of
                            national nuclear capability, an advance to broader agreements might then
                            open up.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>The practical question is how best to proceed. It may be that further
                            discussions would reveal new possibilities from both sides as regards
                            the arrangements for the quota of inspections. But if we attempted to
                            reach this point by the present methods both sides may feel unable to
                            make an advance because this would appear to be surrendering some point
                            of substance without obtaining a final agreement on a definite treaty in
                            exchange. It may be that we could make some progress on this question of
                            numbers by exploring an idea which has been mentioned by the neutral
                            nations in Geneva—the idea that a quota of on-site inspections might be
                            agreed upon to cover a period of several years, from which inspections
                            could be drawn under more flexible conditions than an annual quota would
                            permit.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>(a) But at the moment it is not only the question of numbers which
                            holds us up, we also have to agree on the final content of the draft
                            treaty and in particular to decide certain important questions as to how
                                <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0292"/>inspection is to be carried
                            out. You have taken the view that once the quota is agreed the other
                            matters can easily be settled, whereas we feel that the final agreement
                            about the number of inspections is unlikely to be possible unless most
                            of the other matters have been first disposed of. Thus we have reached
                            an impasse.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>We should be interested to hear your suggestions as to how we are to
                            break out of this. For our part we should be quite prepared now to
                            arrange private tripartite discussions in whatever seemed the most
                            practical way. For example, our chief representatives at Geneva could
                            conduct discussions on the questions which remain to be settled.
                            Alternatively, or at a later stage, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>/Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> and I would be ready to send
                            in due course very senior representatives who would be empowered to
                            speak for us and talk in Moscow directly with you. It would be our hope
                            that either in Geneva or through such senior representatives in Moscow
                            we might bring the matter close enough to a final decision so that it
                            might then be proper to think in terms of a meeting of the three of us
                            at which a definite agreement on a test ban could be made final. It is
                            of course obvious that a meeting of the three of us which resulted in a
                            test ban treaty would open a new chapter in our relations as well as
                            providing an opportunity for wider discussions.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>We sincerely trust that you will give serious consideration to this
                            proposal. We believe that the nuclear tests agreement and what may
                            follow from it is the most hopeful area in which to try for agreement
                            between us. The procedure which we have suggested seems to us the most
                            practical way of achieving a result which would be welcome all over the
                            world.</item>

                    <p>“Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                    <p>I have become most concerned over recent developments in Laos. As you know, I
                        have always regarded our mutual commitment in Vienna to bring peace to that
                        unhappy country as an important milestone in Soviet/American relations. If
                        we could work successfully together to make Laos neutral, we could, I have
                        thought, make progress in resolving other matters which are at issue between
                        us.</p>

                        myself with your message of April 11.<note n="1" xml:id="d98fn1"><ref
                                target="#d95">Document 95</ref>.</note> If my impression is correct
                        as to its principal <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0294"/>motive, namely
                        to seek out new possibilities for the cooperation of our countries in the
                        resolution of questions which are ripe for settlement, then it is fully
                        responsive to my thoughts. I, like you, consider as formerly that it is
                        extremely important to us to understand each other clearly in order to avoid
                        unnecessary dangers or obstacles to progress in the achievement of peaceful
                        agreements. Everything which proceeds to the advantage of mutual
                        understanding and trust between our countries and between us personally will
                        always meet on my part a most favorable response.</p>
                    <p>My colleagues and I frequently ponder over how relations are developing
                        between our two countries. Yes, and could it be otherwise if by virtue of
                        the position occupied by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the
                            <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> on earth, Soviet-American relations
                        had become a political meridian of their own sort from which one as a matter
                        of fact takes a reading of prognoses and hopes for the peaceful future of
                        peoples. Probably I shall be close to your frame of mind if I say that the
                        crisis in the region of the Caribbean Sea has given many people a new
                        stimulus for reflection on this account.</p>
                    <p>In fact not so long ago both you and I were in the ranks of allied armies
                        acting against the aggressors. These times come to memory not because, as
                        they say, the words of the song do not leave you but because we rightfully
                        prided ourselves on the fact that the Soviet and American peoples each in
                        their own way wrote their words in the general hymn of victory over
                        Hitlerite Germany and militarist Japan. No, I mentally return to that tragic
                        and at the same time heroic period because it clearly demonstrated the
                        possibility of the establishment between the Soviet Union and the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> of such relations as when their mutual
                        interests decidedly outweigh the differences of views on the remainder.
                        Unfortunately, shortly after the war relations between our countries were
                        upset and rolled down an inclined plane.</p>
                    <p>We did not wish to accept such a position and undertook practical efforts in
                        order to find some sort of general basis which would permit a return to
                        relations between our countries in a better direction. In proposals
                        following this aim, we appealed both to you and your predecessors in the
                        Office of President and here we were talking about a wide circle of
                        international questions: disarmament, security in Europe, direct
                        Soviet-American relations and many other things. Now, one way or another it
                        must be recognized that the track in which relations between our countries
                        found themselves under Franklin Roosevelt, now remains empty. We refuse to
                        believe that the sole path which remained for the two mightiest powers was a
                        slide along that inclined plane from one international crisis to another
                        still more dangerous one. There is another perspective: given the mutual
                        desire of the parties—and as for us we say “Yes”—it is possible to raise our
                        countries to the highway of peaceful, mutually beneficial cooperation. I
                        think you share my certainty that such <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273"
                            facs="0295"/>a beneficial turning-point in Soviet-American relations,
                        and government officials who knew how to bring it about, would be applauded
                        not only by Soviet and American peoples but by all to whom peace on our
                        planet is dear.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we have not abandoned hope that the Government of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> irrespective of all difference of world
                        outlook and way of life, will together with us work for the creation of
                        conditions for peaceful, I underline peaceful, competition in the course of
                        which each social system, each country, would demonstrate its possibilities
                        for the satisfaction of the requirements of the people.</p>
                    <p>The entire foreign political activity of the Soviet Government is subordinate
                        to the service of peace and peaceful co-existence. It is precisely from
                        these positions that we approach the international questions touched upon in
                        your message.</p>
                    <p>The question of the cessation of nuclear testing is touched upon in your
                        message. As you doubtless know, we have long considered that our Western
                        partners are still far from having traversed their part of the distance to
                        the desired finish—the conclusion of an agreement.</p>
                    <p>We have now received from you and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
                            >Macmillan</persName> new proposals on this question.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d98fn2">See <ref target="#d96">Document 96</ref>.</note>
                        Inasmuch as you and the Prime Minister are addressing yourselves to us
                        together and inasmuch as some time is required to study these proposals, I
                        shall not specially dwell here on the question of the cessation of testing
                        and shall write you and the Prime Minister separately.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d98fn3"><ref target="#d99">Document 99</ref>.</note> I shall
                        only say that for its part the Soviet Government has done and will do
                        everything in order in the shortest possible time to approach the final act,
                        which would crown the efforts of many years, to agree on the conclusion of
                        an agreement on the cessation of testing of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Here I shall dwell on a question which, although to a certain extent also
                        touches on the cessation of nuclear testing, has itself acquired increasing
                        significance and urgency particularly now in connection with various plans
                        for the creation of nuclear forces of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
                        I have in mind the task which by the will of history has been placed first
                        of all before our countries; to act so that nuclear armaments even before
                        general and complete disarmament should remain walled up in the arsenals of
                        those powers which already possess, them and in order that it would be
                        possible not to fear that sometime the doors of the nuclear club will be
                        broken and we shall hear the triumphant exclamation, shall we say, in the
                        German language, “I am already here!” You of course know well the point of
                        view of the Soviet Government concerning the non-dissemination of nuclear
                            <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0296"/>weapons. In brief it consists
                        in this, that if it is not possible immediately to agree on the destruction
                        of such weapons, then at least anticipating this it is necessary not to
                        permit their further dissemination. And seriously if a dam is properly
                        constructed which would not permit a flood of nuclear weapons then the first
                        duty of the builders is to concern themselves that no single crack or outlet
                        canals remain; otherwise all the construction loses its meaning. The
                        proposal of the Soviet Government to conclude an international agreement
                        which on the one hand would contain the requirement of the atomic powers not
                        to transfer any form of nuclear weapons—directly or indirectly including via
                        military alliances to those states which do not possess them—and on the
                        other hand the obligations of other powers not to manufacture or to acquire
                        such weapons serves precisely this purpose.<note n="4" xml:id="d98fn4">For
                            text of the Soviet note to the United States, April 8, in which this
                            proposal was made, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament,
                                1963</hi>, pp. 161-170.</note> In other words, we are talking here
                        about new states not acquiring or utilizing nuclear weapons in any form.</p>
                    <p>I note with satisfaction that in your message you confirm that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> is decisively against the development of
                        additional national nuclear potentials. At the same time you, now as
                        formerly, attempt to convince me that neither the multinational nor
                        multilateral nuclear forces being planned for <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> will increase the danger of the spreading of nuclear
                        weapons and that the Soviet Government can rely on the continuing and
                        decisive opposition of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> to the
                        dissemination of national nuclear forces. Obviously, some sort of gradual
                        acquiring of, or partial participation in, the control of nuclear armaments
                        in your view is better than an appearance of new national nuclear
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>But you will agree, Mr. President, that no matter what crack appears, opening
                        the way to atomic weapons, be it only the size of a little finger, it makes
                        no difference; once such a crack exists there will be found fingers which in
                        this fashion will find their way to the control panels of these weapons. I
                        do not speak of the fact that for states tempted by military adventurism and
                        revengism, the degree of acquisition thus received would appear only a
                        temporary step toward the putting forward of further demands which in the
                        final analysis would lead to the unleashing of new nuclear potential which,
                        as you write, the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> seeks to avoid. It
                        seems that this is clear to everyone who looks on all of these things not
                        only from the positions of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The
                        question arises naturally why place yourself before the choice between what
                        is bad and that which is still worse? Would it not be better to cast aside
                        both the bad and the still worse variant and choose the good?</p>
                    <p>We rapidly believe that the Government of the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                            >USA</gloss> will strive to arrange it so that the multinational and
                        multilateral nuclear forces of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, no
                        matter how their creation comes out in practice could never be <pb n="275"
                            xml:id="pg_275" facs="0297"/>used without the Government of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>. But one way or another states which are
                        included in the nuclear pool of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                        including the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, will have a vote there
                        and will participate in the formulation of opinions and, as a consequence,
                        of the final decisions concerning the utilization of nuclear armaments.
                        Indeed, we all witnessed the fact that in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> the voice of Western Germany is increasingly listened to
                        although everything indicates that at least some members of this bloc not
                        without suspicion look upon the foreign policy of that state remembering the
                        past and knowing from personal experience the habits of the German
                        militarists.</p>
                    <p>It is also no less clear that if there were concluded a genuine agreement
                        which left no loopholes concerning the non-dissemination of nuclear weapons,
                        then in these conditions neither Western Germany nor anyone else would dare
                        go against the collective will of the participants in that agreement since
                        in that case they would appear in a most unfavorable light before all the
                        world and would be subjected, it may be said, to the moral ostracism of all
                        mankind.</p>
                    <p>Naturally we will set forward separately in greater detail our views
                        concerning the draft declaration about the non-dissemination of nuclear
                        weapons which the Secretary of State, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">D.
                            Rusk</persName>, recently handed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                            >A.F. Dobrynin</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d98fn5">A memorandum of

                            65 D 330.</note> But it is already possible to say that unfortunately
                        this draft does not bring us any closer to the achievement of agreement. It
                        is impossible not to note that it contains in reality the same positions
                        which formerly deprived us of the possibility of coming to mutual
                        understanding. This particularly relates to the possibility of permitting
                        access to Western Germany of nuclear weapons on which as a practical matter
                        the American draft is based. No one can expect the agreement of the
                        Government of the Soviet Union to the growth of nuclear fangs by the West
                        German Bundeswehr. I believe you will understand that from our point of view
                        the realization of any plans for the creation of collective nuclear forces
                        cannot but shake the ground under the achievement of international agreement
                        concerning the non-dissemination of nuclear weapons in which the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> should be interested no less than the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Already for a protracted period, in the exchange of opinions between us no
                        matter in what channels they took place, one and the same question has
                        inevitably arisen—concerning the situation around Cuba. To a considerable
                        degree this is understandable if one considers how we passed through a most
                        dangerous crisis in the fall of last year. But it is impossible not to
                        recognize also that tension around Cuba decreases too slowly and at times
                        rises anew not unlike the way the mercury jumps in the thermometers of the
                        present spring.</p>
                    <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0298"/>
                    <p>And of course when one thinks about where the abnormalities are coming from
                        which are making the atmosphere in the region of the Caribbean Sea ever more
                        feverish, one comes to the conclusion that a one-sided approach can least of
                        all help the situation.</p>
                    <p>If one allows that in the Western Hemisphere uneasiness is evoked by the
                        presence in Cuba of a certain small number of Soviet troops which are
                        helping Cubans to master the weapons delivered by the Soviet Union for the
                        purpose of strengthening the defense capabilities of Cuba, then how much
                        more uneasiness should be evoked in the countries of Europe, Asia and Africa
                        by the hundreds of thousands of American troops in the Eastern Hemisphere?
                        It is sufficient to make such a comparison in order that things can be seen
                        in proper perspective. At our meetings in Vienna we seemed to have agreed to
                        proceed from the fact that the forces of our states were equal. Well, then,
                        if our forces are equal, then there should also be equal possibilities. Why
                        does the United States forget about this?</p>
                    <p>You know that we have withdrawn from Cuba a significant part of our military
                        personnel. I can tell you that we have withdrawn several times more people
                        than has been stated in the American press. How this matter will develop in
                        the future depends on a number of circumstances and in the first place on
                        the pace at which the atmosphere in the region of the Caribbean Sea will be
                        normalized, and whether, as could be expected, the reasons which occasioned
                        the necessity for assistance to the Cubans by Soviet military specialists
                        and instructors will disappear.</p>
                    <p>I would like to express the thought of how important it is in evaluating what
                        is happening around Cuba that one rise above one-sided understandings and
                        base his judgments on the respective estimate of the situation of the
                        interested parties. From your point of view, as set forth in your message,
                        the reconnaissance flights of American aircraft over Cuba are only “peaceful
                        observation.” But if one were to characterize these flights objectively,
                        without even considering the point of view, understandable to everyone, of
                        the country over which they are being carried out, then they cannot be
                        described other than as an unrestrained intrusion into the air space of a
                        sovereign government and as a flagrant violation of the elementary norms of
                        international law and the principles of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> Charter, to which are affixed the signatures of both the
                            <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and Cuba. It is natural that no
                        state prizing its sovereignty, no government solicitous of the interest and
                        dignity of its people, can tolerate such flights.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps it is desired that we recognize the right of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> to violate the Charter of the United
                        Nations and international norms? But this we cannot do and will not do.</p>
                    <p>We have honestly carried out the obligations we assumed in the settlement of
                        the crisis in the region of the Caribbean Sea, and withdrew from Cuba even
                        more than we promised to withdraw. There are no <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277"
                            facs="0299"/>grounds for you to doubt the readiness of the Soviet Union
                        to carry out firmly in the future as well the agreement which was reached
                        between us. Why then are reconnaissance flights by American aircraft over
                        Cuba necessary? What are they looking for there when there is not a single
                        thing, seen in the light of the agreement reached, which could cause
                        concern? Trampling on sovereignty in this way can lead to quite serious
                        consequences for us if it is not stopped in time.</p>
                    <p>And can one pass over in silence or recognize as in accordance with the
                        principles of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter the continuing
                        efforts to strangle the economy of Cuba? I shall not address myself to this
                        in more detail although of course I could find many words with which to
                        characterize these actions, even from a purely humanitarian point of
                        view.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union gives due credit to the measures which have recently been
                        undertaken by the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, as well as by
                        England, in connection with the attacks which have taken place on Soviet
                        vessels near the Cuban coast. We of course do not underestimate the
                        significance of these measures and hope that they will be sufficiently
                        effective to preclude the possibility of a repetition of armed raids against
                        Cuba.</p>
                    <p>I read with a feeling of satisfaction that passage of your message in which
                        you confirm that you have neither the intention nor the desire to invade
                        Cuba and where you recognize that it is up to Cuban people to determine
                        their fate. That is a good statement. We have always stressed that, like any
                        other people, the Cuban people possess the inalienable right to determine
                        their own fate as they see fit.</p>
                    <p>A few words about Laos, since you touched on this subject in your message.
                        Certainly the events which have taken place during the past weeks in that
                        country give rise to some concern. Especially alarming is the murder of the
                        Minister of Foreign Affairs K. Pholsena. The life has been cut short of a
                        statesman whose signature was put on the Geneva Agreements on Laos, whose
                        name, together with that of <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna
                            Phouma</persName>, personified a policy of neutrality for Laos. There
                        are also other facts which show that in that little country great passions
                        continue to boil, leading on occasion to dangerous flare-ups.</p>
                    <p>There is much to indicate that forces are raising their heads there which
                        also before were resisting the development of the country along the path of
                        peace, independence and neutrality, and information is constantly reaching
                        us indicating that this is taking place with certain outside help. I
                        examined this matter long and carefully in order to see whether this was
                        true and came to the conclusion that the proverb “where there is smoke there
                        is fire” was applicable to the present situation.</p>
                    <p>It appears to us that the United States can exert appropriate influence so as
                        to prevent dangerous complications in Laos, which are necessary neither to
                        you nor to us.</p>
                    <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0300"/>
                    <p>As you obviously know, we are at the present time carrying on consultation
                        with the British co-chairman of the Geneva Agreement.</p>
                    <p>There is no need for me to say that the Soviet Government as formerly is
                        holding firmly to the course of supporting a neutral and independent Laos,
                        which was agreed upon in our meeting in Vienna. We are doing everything that
                        depends on us in order to maintain peace and quiet in that country. If the
                            <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> also follows this course firmly, and
                        we think that this should be the case, then it would seem that we can look
                        at the situation in Laos without excessive pessimism.</p>
                    <p>I received your message dealing with the situation in Laos which you
                        authorized Mr.<persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> to give
                            me.<note n="6" xml:id="d98fn6">See <ref target="#d97fn1">Document 97 and
                                footnote 1</ref> thereto.</note> He and I exchanged views on this
                        question, and he obviously will report our conversation in detail to you.
                        Therefore I will limit myself in the present message to what I have said
                        above.</p>
                    <p>I agree with you that we have before us also other questions and problems
                        aside from those mentioned in your message. In the first instance, I would
                        mention the conclusion of a German peace treaty and normalization of the
                        situation in West Berlin on that basis. The solution of this problem, and
                        given mutual desire that is not now such a difficult matter, would
                        undoubtedly bear the greatest returns both from the standpoint of the
                        interest of consolidating peace and for a serious improvement in
                        Soviet-American relations. As long as the remnants of the Second World War,
                        which constantly make themselves known continue to exist, then both you and
                        we will be forced to devote ever greater funds to armaments, that is to
                        increasing our ability to destroy each other. And understandably in such a
                        situation it is difficult to count on agreement on disarmament, which
                        requires above all faith and still more faith for its attainment. Therefore,
                        if one realistically evaluates the situation, one cannot but come to the
                        conclusion that the conclusion of a German peace treaty would create better
                        conditions also for the resolution of the question of questions of the
                        modern day—universal and complete disarmament.</p>
                    <p>I like the proposition you have made concerning a trip to Moscow of your duly
                        authorized personal representative with whom it would be possible to discuss
                        unofficially and frankly problems of interest to both of us. Please be
                        assured that your envoy will receive a good reception in Moscow and complete
                        readiness on the part of the Soviet Government and me personally for a
                        confidential and productive exchange of views.</p>
                    <p>As concerns the choice of time for your duly authorized personal
                        representative to arrive in Moscow, I am inclined to think, after examining
                        the list of undertakings, in part also of a domestic nature, which demand
                            <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0301"/>my participation, that probably
                        the most appropriate period for this meeting would be 10 to 12 June, if of
                        course that is acceptable to you.<note n="7" xml:id="d98fn7">See <ref

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have carefully studied your
                        message on the question of the cessation of nuclear tests, which was
                        transmitted to me by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                            >Kohler</persName> on April 24.<note n="1" xml:id="d99fn1">See <ref
                                target="#d96">Document 96</ref>.</note> You stated in this message
                        that you consider how—from your standpoint—action should be taken for the
                        achievement of the earliest possible understanding, and you offer proposals
                        concerning procedures for further negotiations.</p>
                    <p>We have considered all this, consulted one another in the government, held
                        consultation once again with specialists, and I want to tell you our
                        considerations in reply to your message. I shall also communicate these
                        considerations to Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> in
                        reply to his message which is identical with yours.</p>
                    <p>I think that at present it is not necessary to delve deeper into the history
                        of negotiations on the cessation of tests or present in all details our
                        position and our proposals, which have already been stated more than once.
                        You know them well and we have also learned almost by heart the proposals of
                        the Western powers, just as we used to learn “Pater Noster.” I merely wish
                        to touch upon some of the main questions and basic differences between our
                        positions.</p>
                    <p>What is the approach of the Soviet Government to the question of the
                        cessation of nuclear tests? It is very simple: we stand for the cessation
                            <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0302"/>of all tests for all time,
                        wherever they may be carried out: in the atmosphere, the cosmos,
                        underground, and under water.</p>
                    <p>We take such a position first of all because the question regarding the
                        cessation of nuclear weapons tests has an indisputable significance from the
                        moral and humane viewpoint. Its solution would put an end to the
                        contamination of air, water, the bowels and surface of the earth by
                        radio-active substances, harmful to the health of the people now living and
                        for future generations. As it seems to us, this already appears to be a
                        sufficient incentive for coming to an understanding regarding the
                        prohibition of tests.</p>
                    <p>It appears that the achievement of such an understanding could also exert a
                        definite and positive influence on the international situation. To be sure,
                        the conclusion of an understanding regarding the cessation of tests would
                        not stop the arms race, would not diminish by one charge the stocks of
                        nuclear weapons accumulated by states; it would not even slow down further
                        accumulation of these stocks. The prohibition of tests does not appear to be
                        the key problem for lessening international tension. The roots of this
                        tension lie entirely elsewhere, above all in the fact that the German peace
                        settlement has not yet been reached. And yet the conclusion of an agreement
                        regarding the prohibition of nuclear tests could somewhat clear up the
                        atmosphere in the relations between nuclear powers and would be evaluated
                        everywhere as an expression of their readiness to seek a solution to the
                        questions affecting the interests of both sides. I understood that you also
                        attach significance to this.</p>
                    <p>We are convinced that it is not difficult to solve the question regarding the
                        cessation of nuclear tests if one manifests a desire to achieve this. Right
                        now, when both sides have completed important series of tests and when your
                        and our scientists are in agreement that for further improvement of nuclear
                        weapons there is no special necessity for new tests, then it seems that it
                        should be even easier than before to come to an agreement on this
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>On our part we also see no difficulties whatever in the question of control
                        over the carrying out by the states of their obligations under the agreement
                        of prohibition of nuclear tests. We know that national means now available
                        for discovering nuclear explosion, including also underground explosions,
                        are amply sufficient to unmask any state which might try to conduct nuclear
                        weapons tests under cover of secrecy.</p>
                    <p>If it is necessary to have new confirmation of the fact that even underground
                        nuclear explosions cannot be conducted in such a way that they would not
                        become known, then new proof of this lies in the fact that our seismic
                        stations unerringly caught the vibrations of the earth crust produced by the
                        recent French nuclear tests in the Sahara. I do not doubt that seismologists
                        in the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> also have recorded these
                        vibrations.</p>
                    <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0303"/>
                    <p>But if the Soviet Union is prepared to rely wholly on the national means for
                        verification of the cessation of underground nuclear tests, then there is no
                        reason why the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> could not do the
                        same.</p>
                    <p>Such, Mr. President, is our approach to the solution of the problem of
                        prohibition of nuclear tests. This is an honest and equitable approach. If
                        an agreement is concluded on this basis, then everybody will gain and no
                        side will lose.</p>
                    <p>Then why do the Western Powers not accept this approach? Why do they continue
                        to insist on international inspection of the discontinuance of underground
                        nuclear explosions? In the interest of such a cause there is no need of
                        inspection of the cessation of underground tests just as there is no need
                        for international control of the cessation of tests in the atmosphere, in
                        space, and under water with which the Western Powers now agree. But if no
                        inspection is needed for the control of the cessation of underground tests,
                        and yet the Western Powers continue to insist on it, then we are compelled
                        to draw our own conclusions in regard to the reason why such a demand is put
                        forth.</p>
                    <p>Please, understand me, Mr. President, that under these conditions we cannot
                        regard the demand of the Western Powers for international inspection
                        otherwise than as a policy to charge the Soviet Union for the cessation of
                        the nuclear weapons tests a certain additional price in the form of the
                        admission of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s intelligence men to
                        Soviet territory, where, of course, there are many objects of interest to
                        the military intelligence of the states of this bloc. Sometimes, however,
                        the matter is presented in such a way as if equality is ensured by the fact
                        that espionage would be carried out, so to speak, on the basis of
                        reciprocity. But such “reciprocity” would not result in anything good; it
                        could only intensify mistrust in our relations. We do not want to enter on
                        such a path and we have no desire to send our intelligence men to the United
                        States of America.</p>
                    <p>We wish to make everything quite clear: the Soviet Union would not consent to
                        an agreement which would be detrimental to its security. We are firmly
                        convinced that lasting peace can be founded only on such agreements as would
                        strengthen the security of states and not undermine it.</p>
                    <p>Well known to the entire world and certainly to you, Mr. President, is our
                        sincere desire to reach as soon as possible an agreement among all states on
                        the matter of disarmament. Such an act would really ensure full security for
                        all nations inhabiting our planet. But heretofore we have not been able to
                        reach such an agreement and, furthermore, we do not see any clear prospects
                        in this direction. Under such conditions the decisive factor is the problem
                        of security of every country, and we, of course, are concerned about the
                        security of our country, and we cannot in this regard permit any concession
                        which military intelligence services may exploit to conduct espionage in our
                        country.</p>
                    <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0304"/>
                    <p>If an agreement for universal and complete disarmament under international
                        control is reached, such control we would not regard as espionage because it
                        would be actually carried out on a reciprocal basis under the stipulation
                        that all states liquidate their armed forces and armaments, and such control
                        would be in the interest of all countries and nations of the world.</p>
                    <p>You might ask me why, if the Soviet Union considers international inspections
                        for the discontinuance of nuclear tests as a means of espionage, it
                        consented to the conducting of such inspections on Soviet territory four
                        months ago? You know what motivated such a step, because at that time we
                        explained our motives and thoughts on this point. However, since it can be
                        seen from your letter that you interpret them in a somewhat different way, I
                        feel that it would be better if we clarify our position once more.</p>
                    <p>We consented to inspections not because we came to the conclusion that they
                        were necessary for verification of the states' carrying out their
                        obligations under a treaty for discontinuance of nuclear weapons tests. No,
                        we agreed to this only because we ascribed a definite meaning to your
                        statements, Mr. President, that without a minimum number of on-site
                        inspections you would not be able to succeed in persuading the United States
                        Senate to ratify an agreement for the cessation of tests. And though there
                        was nothing that obligated the Soviet Union to consider the fine points of
                        such purely internal matters as the disposition of forces in the U.S.
                        Senate, we decided to meet you half-way and to agree to a minimum number of
                        inspections on Soviet territory.</p>
                    <p>I shall not conceal the fact that it was not easy for us to adopt the
                        decision to agree to the number of inspections indicated by us. But we
                        proceed from the premise that they are not relevant to the problem and
                        technically not justified, and so why should we agree to them? For a long
                        time I deliberated as to whether I should take such initiative with our
                        government or not. On the one hand I, as Chairman of the Council of
                        Ministers of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, felt the
                        responsibility for solving questions of disarmament and discontinuance of
                        tests which, as was recognized one year ago, rests with the heads of
                        governments and states participating in negotiations on these questions. On
                        the other hand I, in my position, bear the highest responsibility for
                        guaranteeing the security of the Soviet Union and must not forget this for a
                        moment. And still I have come to the conclusion that it is probably
                        worthwhile in this case to take a step forward now to meet the Western
                        powers in order to ensure the swift achievement of an agreement on stopping
                        tests. In proceeding in this manner, we, of course, had counted on the fact
                        that as a result of a peaceful settlement of the crisis in the Caribbean Sea
                        area on an international basis, as was hoped at that time, the germs of
                        confidence might begin to <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0305"/>sprout.
                        We had hoped that our new step in the direction of stopping tests might help
                        these sprouts burst forth and grow strong.</p>
                    <p>But this did not mean at all that, as you write, we had accepted the
                        “principle of verifying on the spot undetermined phenomena.” Not at all! We
                        have not accepted and do not accept this principle in the sense that there
                        is any necessity for verification on the spot; there is no need for
                        that.</p>
                    <p>That is how our agreement arose concerning inspection. This decision was
                        dictated by purely political considerations, by the desire to achieve more
                        quickly the cessation of all nuclear tests, but in no case did this mean any
                        revision of our opinion concerning the futility of inspections from a
                        scientific and technical standpoint.</p>
                    <p>After we had taken this great step toward meeting the Western powers, it was
                        directly up to them and solely up to them as to whether the subsequent
                        obstacles on the road to agreement would be removed. We had hoped that the
                        Western powers, in their turn, would likewise take an equally important step
                        forward, and the only remaining step would be to prepare a treaty text for
                        the cessation of tests and sign it.</p>
                    <p>One can only be sorry that in reality this did not come to pass. Instead of a
                        positive reply to our initiative the Western powers began to haggle
                        concerning the number of inspections and the conditions for conducting them,
                        and this cannot be construed otherwise than meaning that they are really not
                        prepared to conclude an agreement on the cessation of tests on such a basis
                        as would give nobody an advantage and would inflict no damage on anyone. But
                        on any other basis there can be no agreement at all between the powers
                        during our era. When we are requested to make some new concessions in the
                        matter of inspections, this can merely mean that an agreement is becoming
                        more and more remote, that its attainment is becoming less and less likely.
                        Thus the negotiations being conducted lose all sense of direction and cannot
                        get out of the doldrums.</p>
                    <p>And now I come to that which, apparently, constitutes the very essence of the
                        messages which I received from you and Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
                            >Macmillan</persName>. To summarize briefly what is stated in these
                        messages, their main thought, as I have understood it, reduces itself to the
                        proposal to continue haggling over inspections, but at a higher level.
                        Please pardon me for my straightforwardness, but I could draw no other
                        conclusion, however much I read the messages. Considerations are expressed
                        therein as to how to carry forward the movement as to the figures of annual
                        inspections; reference is made to the possibility of establishing a quota
                        for several years; there is brought up the question of how these inspections
                        should be conducted, etc.</p>
                    <p>All this merely confirms that the sense and significance of our concession in
                        the matter of inspections have not only not been duly appreciated, but there
                        is a desire to use this concession as some kind of <pb n="284"
                            xml:id="pg_284" facs="0306"/>springboard for achieving other objectives
                        and not at all for settling the problem of stopping nuclear tests.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government sincerely desires to reach an agreement for the
                        cessation of nuclear tests, but it cannot and will not approach an
                        understanding on the conditions proposed by the Western powers. Our people
                        would have every right to severely question their government if it entered
                        into negotiations as to how many intelligence agents we would admit annually
                        to our territory and what conditions we would grant to such intelligence
                        agents. But the Western powers in their proposals, which they have advanced
                        in negotiation for the cessation of nuclear weapons tests, insist that in
                        the implementation of any inspection they have the right to check the
                        territory to the extent of 500 square km. Just imagine what an enormous area
                        would be covered by these inspections, if there were seven or eight of them,
                        as the Western powers insist on. And is it possible for you to think that we
                        can seriously regard such a proposal, the unserious character of which is
                        obvious to us.</p>
                    <p>When we agreed on two or three inspections we thought that these inspections
                        would be very symbolic, and that the question would never arise concerning
                        the inspection of such vast areas—all the more so with the use of various
                        methods of boring, flying about, etc. No, we will not accept that, because
                        there is absolutely no need for that. Thus, if the position of the Western
                        powers is judged by their proposals, then one comes to the conclusion that
                        they really have no serious attitude toward negotiation. And it seems to me
                        that if the Western powers would seriously consider their own proposals and
                        realistically evaluate their partner's position, then they themselves would
                        come to understand that these proposals are unacceptable to us.</p>
                    <p>If the question is now approached in a businesslike manner, then it must be
                        admitted that the establishment of automatic seismic stations, the so-called
                        “black boxes,” is fully sufficient, and to this, as before, we consent.
                        Nothing else is required.</p>
                    <p>As soon as I had studied your message for the first time, I said to
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">F. Kohler</persName><note n="2"

                        impression of mine has now become even stronger, and I even wonder whether

                            >Macmillan</persName> is not connected with some additional internal
                        policy consideration.</p>
                    <p>In any case we took note of the fact that although the messages of the
                        President of the United States and of the Prime Minister of Great Britain
                        addressed to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285"
                            facs="0307"/>in this case strictly confidential, the content of these
                        messages was announced by the press of some of the Western countries several
                        days before they were handed to the addressee. It is as if someone wanted
                        especially to show who is the initiator of this “constructive” step. We,
                        however, will not participate in these schemes and will not be drawn into
                        them.</p>
                    <p>What will the further course of developments be on the question of stopping
                        nuclear tests? To tell the truth, I do not know; it depends on the Western
                        Powers whether there will be an agreement. The explosions of American
                        nuclear devices in Nevada and of French nuclear devices in the Sahara cannot
                        but cause us to wonder whether there are any prospects at present of
                        reaching an agreement on the banning of tests, or whether we shall not again
                        have to turn our attention in another direction, that of taking measures
                        which would ensure a still more reliable guarantee of the security of the
                        Soviet Union and other Socialist states. This, obviously, is also made
                        imperative for us because of the measures of the Western powers in
                        establishing a joint nuclear force in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                        >NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Is such a development, Mr. President, in harmony with the interests of our
                        two countries? It seems to me that it is not. But this depends not so much
                        on the Soviet Union as on the other side, and on the future actions of the
                        other side.</p>
                    <p>It gives me no satisfaction to say this. I repeat that we were anticipating
                        something quite different in the question of stopping nuclear tests—the
                        conclusion of an agreement. And we are now, as before, prepared to seek an
                        agreement, provided that our negotiating partners are also prepared to do
                        so. It would be even more important to approach a decision on the main
                        problems—disarmament and a peaceful German settlement. But in the
                        disarmament discussions at Geneva there has been, as before, no evidence of
                        any accomplishments except the multiplication of the number of minutes. Such
                        a situation cannot but give rise to anxiety.</p>
                    <p>In your and Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName>'s messages
                        you propose sending to Moscow high-ranking representatives who would have
                        full powers to carry on, in your name, discussions about the cessation of
                        nuclear weapons tests. So be it; we are even prepared to try this method of
                        discussion too, and in general we consider it right to use every opportunity
                        in order to effect a rapprochement of the positions of the respective sides.
                        For that reason we shall be happy to receive in Moscow the high-level
                        representatives of the United States and Great Britain. It is important,
                        however, that they be empowered to negotiate on the question of stopping
                        nuclear weapons tests on the same realistic and equitable basis which life
                        itself suggests, i.e., without spying inspections in foreign territories.
                        This is the crux of the whole problem.</p>
                    <p>We would, of course, also welcome a meeting at the highest level, the
                        possibility of holding which, for the purpose of reaching a definitive <pb
                            n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0308"/>understanding on the agreement for
                        banning tests, is mentioned in your message. I should gladly take part in
                        such a meeting, provided that there is hope of its being successful; for
                        that, one thing is now necessary—namely, that the Western powers, too, show
                        a desire to negotiate and come to an agreement.</p>
                    <p>These are my ideas as regards the thoughts which were set forth by you and
                            Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> in your
                        messages.</p>

                        discussed some of the outstanding issues between us, even though I can find
                        little encouragement from the gaps which separate us on these problems. I am
                        especially concerned about Laos, on which I felt we had reached an agreement
                        to which we have on our side given full support.</p>

                    <p>I am more than ever of the opinion that a visit to Moscow by a personal

                        undertake this task. Unfortunately, for a number of reasons, including the
                        fact that he has some long outstanding commitments, the date of ten to
                        twelve June, which you have suggested, is a <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287"
                            facs="0309"/>very inconvenient time for him. Moreover, he will be
                        accompanying me on my visit to Europe in the latter half of June. He would,
                        however, be prepared to come at any time in July or August that is
                        convenient to you, and I should be grateful if you could suggest a

                            <item>Since we received your letter of May 8 about the question of the

                                carefully considering it and we have now jointly agreed to send you
                                letters in similar terms.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Let me say first of all that Prime Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> and I are glad that you
                                feel able to accept our suggestion that we should send highly placed
                                representatives to Moscow who would be empowered to carry this
                                question further and would be able to discuss the matter with you.
                                We should be glad to send our representatives to Moscow at a time
                                convenient to you either during the last half of June or, if you
                                would prefer this, in the first half of July. We would hope that our
                                representatives might have the advantage of a personal discussion
                                with you.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>We realize that our positions are still different, especially on
                                the nature of the problem of inspections, but we agree with you that
                                it is important “to use every opportunity in order to effect a
                                rapprochement of the positions of the respective sides.” It is in
                                this spirit that we think a visit of high-level representatives to
                                Moscow would be good, so that both sides can talk fully and freely
                                about ways of bridging the gap between us.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>If you can accept this proposal, we suggest that the present
                                correspondence should remain confidential but that in view of the
                                world-wide interest an announcement should be made straightaway to
                                the effect that as a result of our correspondence on the subject of
                                a nuclear test ban treaty, it has been agreed that you will receive
                                highly placed representatives of the Prime Minister and me in Moscow
                                during the month of June/July in order to carry forward the
                                discussion of possibilities.</item>

                            <item>There are, however, two points that you have made in your letter
                                to which we think we should reply in advance of detailed
                                discussions. In the first place, you state that “national means now
                                available for discovering nuclear explosions, including also
                                underground explosions, are amply sufficient to unmask any state
                                which might try to conduct nuclear weapons tests under cover of
                                secrecy.” You cite the example of recent French tests in the Sahara,
                                point out that your seismologists detected the vibrations in the
                                earth produced by these tests and state that you have no doubt that
                                our seismologists “also have recorded these vibrations.”</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>While we agree that developments in seismological techniques have
                                made it possible now to detect most of the earth tremors produced by
                                subterranean disturbances of significant size, we do not agree that
                                it is possible by these techniques alone to ascertain in many
                                important cases whether these tremors were caused by natural
                                earthquakes or man-made explosions. For such identification on-site
                                inspection is still necessary in many cases. This was, of course,
                                the position agreed by the Geneva Conference of Experts in 1958 in
                                which Soviet scientists participated; and at recent private
                                conferences between scientists of our three countries there has been
                                general agreement that there are underground events which occur in
                                both of our countries whose origin could not be identified with
                                certainty without an on-site inspection.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>To return to the recent French test in the Sahara, the earth
                                tremors produced by the most recent French test were certainly
                                detected, but prior to the French test it was generally known that
                                it was going to take place in the fairly near future as well as
                                where it would be. The detection of the earth tremors from the
                                French underground nuclear explosion therefore does not, in our
                                view, prove that all nuclear explosions can be identified by
                                national detection systems alone. This is, of course, the central
                                point in our argument in favor of a reasonable number of on-site
                                inspections for underground tests as part of a treaty to ban all
                                nuclear tests, and we sincerely believe this argument to be well
                                founded on scientific fact.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>The second point to which we feel we must refer is your suggestion
                                that the purpose of our requirement for a system of on-site
                                inspections is to send intelligence agents on to the Soviet
                                territory so as to carry out espionage. We most sincerely and
                                categorically affirm that we have no such purpose. We had thought
                                that this was made clear by the proposals we have made which in our
                                view would prevent on-site inspections being misused for espionage
                                purposes. If you are still in doubt on this matter, our
                                representatives are prepared to discuss in detail the safeguards
                                which could be arranged in this matter so that we can satisfy each
                                other that we are both prepared to enter into a test ban in good
                                faith. We think that reasonable provisions for on-site inspections
                                will make it possible for us to work out a treaty which will endure
                                and not be liable to <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0314"/>break
                                down because of unfounded suspicions which could easily have been
                                dispelled by reasonable provisions for verification. We believe that
                                given good will it should be possible to reach agreement on a method
                                of inspection and on a number which would satisfy both of us.</item>

                    <p>Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> and I wish in conclusion
                        to express our pleasure at your belief that the signing of a treaty to end
                        nuclear weapons tests would have value both in itself and because of its
                        positive effect on the international situation. It is in this belief, which
                        we share, that we hope that the high level discussions we are proposing can
                        take place in Moscow.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have received your message of
                        May 31 <note n="1" xml:id="d106fn1">See <ref target="#d105">Document
                                105</ref>.</note> on the question of cessation of nuclear tests and,
                        it goes without saying, have studied it with due attention. I received an
                        analogous message from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">H.
                            Macmillan</persName>.</p>
                    <p>In your letters, you and Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MHS2">H.
                            Macmillan</persName> repeat your proposal to send to Moscow high-ranking
                        representatives of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and Great
                        Britain, who would be empowered “to discuss ways of overcoming existing
                        differences between us” regarding conditions of agreement on the cessation
                        of nuclear tests. Well, in my previous letter I already expressed my
                        readiness also to try such a method of negotiation. The whole question is
                        where and in what direction to seek for a way of overcoming those
                        differences between our positions, which really exist.</p>
                    <p>It is our profound conviction that success of any further negotiations on the
                        cessation of tests, wherever these negotiations may be conducted<pb n="293"
                            xml:id="pg_293" facs="0315"/>—in Moscow, in Geneva, or in any other
                        place—depends completely, as I wrote to you, on whether both parties are
                        ready to agree on the realistic and equal basis which is prompted by life
                        itself. And that basis is well known. In resolving the question of the
                        cessation of tests, as well as any other international question, it consists
                        of necessity in strictly following the principle of equality of parties and
                        of taking into account the interests of each of them. This means that the
                        attainment of agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests can only be
                        arrived at if neither of the parties attempts to receive any special
                        advantages at the expense of the other party, and, consequently, does not
                        insist on demands which are unacceptable to the other party.</p>
                    <p>However, we have recently become more and more convinced that those with whom
                        we are negotiating are not inclined to conduct negotiations by proceeding
                        from the principle of equality of parties, and still want to receive from us
                        some kind of bonus for the cessation of nuclear-weapons tests. It is not
                        possible otherwise to understand their stubborn attempt to obtain our
                        consent to the conduct of inspections which would open up the possibility of
                        peeping into the places at which the stranger's eye should not look.</p>
                    <p>The fact that the Soviet Union will not consent to the conducting of
                        espionage inspections has been mentioned in nearly everyone of our documents
                        on the question of the cessation of tests, and this question, it would seem,
                        should be clear to the utmost degree. For, under present conditions, when
                        the problem of disarmament has not only not been solved, but the
                        nuclear-armaments race is taking on ever greater proportions and, day by day
                        is being spurred on more and more by the leading <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> powers, we are compelled to display particular concern in
                        order not to endanger the security of our country in any way. And permit me
                        to note, Mr. President, that steps recently undertaken on the creation of a
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear fist in Western Europe,
                        with the participation of the West German revanchists, can in no way
                        stimulate us to relax our vigilance; the opposite is rather the case.</p>
                    <p>You write that the goal of espionage is not being pursued by the Western
                        powers in the question of inspections of the cessation of nuclear tests.
                        But, unfortunately, most recent facts which have been scrupulously verified
                        and have become public knowledge, have shown with all possible certainty how
                        strong is the interest of the intelligence services of some powers in
                        secrets of our defense and, at the same time, how unscrupulous they are in
                        the choice of methods. One would have to have an exceptional share of
                        naivete to rely on the possibility that appropriate agencies in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries—which, it may be said, day and
                        night devote themselves to the study of, and as they themselves put it, the
                        selection of targets on the territory of the Soviet Union and other
                        peace-loving states for nuclear strikes—would shrink from using for these
                        same purposes the <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0316"/>channels which
                        would be opened up if we were to agree to the demands of the Western powers
                        on inspection. If we displayed such naivete, it would not be difficult to
                        image what attitude the Soviet people would take towards such leaders.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, when you say that representatives of the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                            >USA</gloss> and Great Britain would be prepared to discuss with us in
                        detail guarantees which should remove our doubts concerning inspections, I
                        do not think, to tell the truth, that this would settle the matter. The root
                        of everything is not in guarantees with which inspections might be
                        surrounded, but in why such insistence is displayed by the Western powers on
                        the question of inspections, when actually there is no need for them, when,
                        indeed, there is in fact no need for them at all, if one bears in mind only
                        the interests of control in the fulfillment by states of their obligations
                        under an agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests.</p>
                    <p>In your message of May 31, you seem to wish again to urge us to start
                        discussion on whether national means of detection of underground nuclear
                        explosions are sufficient or insufficient for controlling the fulfillment of
                        such an agreement. But what is there here to argue about, and what is there
                        to discuss? Facts which confirm complete sufficiency of national means are
                        at hand. And you, too, it seems, have no doubts about, for example, the fact
                        mentioned in my message—namely, that seismic tremors from the French
                        underground nuclear tests in the Sahara were registered by national means of
                        states at a distance of many thousands of kilometers. And nevertheless, for
                        some reason, you do not consider it possible to accept as proof even such
                        indisputable data.</p>
                    <p>As I recall, Mr. President, in one of your press conferences you stressed
                        that a treaty on the prohibition of nuclear tests must give assurance that,
                        if any country carries out a series of secret underground tests, these tests
                        will be detected. Recently I had occasion to become acquainted with a
                        statement on the question of the cessation of tests, made by a group of
                        well-known American scientists representing scientific centers and
                        universities of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> known the world
                        over. I think that you read it too. What did these American scientists have
                        to say, what ideas did they come out with, these American scientists who, as
                        they say, know what they're talking about, if one takes into account that it
                        is precisely the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> which has great
                        experience in carrying out of underground nuclear explosions? They declare
                        that, given contemporary means of detection, it is impossible to conceal a
                        series of underground nuclear explosions, even one of small yield.
                        Consequently, those means of detection already in existence satisfy the
                        principal demand which you make for a treaty.</p>
                    <p>If one considers that national means of detection can be supplemented by
                        automatic seismic stations, how can one fail to admit that all this is more
                        than sufficient for a most reliable control over the cessation of <pb
                            n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0317"/>all nuclear tests? Under these
                        conditions no state would undertake secretly to violate an agreement, since
                        such a step would be fraught for it with the risk of being exposed and of
                        receiving such a blow to its prestige on the international scene from which
                        it would be difficult for any state to recover. National means of detection,
                        combined with automatic seismic stations—this, certainly, is a fully
                        reliable guarantee against any attempts to produce secret nuclear explosions
                        in circumvention of an agreement on the cessation of tests. And we are
                        agreeable to the installation of automatic seismic stations; you know
                        this.</p>
                    <p>In the light of all this, is it necessary for me to repeat once more that, if
                        in December of last year we agreed to the conducting of a certain minimum
                        number of inspections on the cessation of underground tests, we did so only
                        and exclusively out of political considerations, with a view to making
                        easier for you, Mr. President, the ratification of a treaty on the cessation
                        of tests by the Senate of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>. But as a
                        matter of fact, however, the resolution of the question of the cessation of
                        tests could be handled perfectly well without any inspections. That was true
                        in December 1962, and is all the more true now as well.</p>
                    <p>Thus, it is completely possible to conclude an agreement on the cessation of
                        nuclear tests on the basis of equality, if only all the participants want
                        this. We are, of course, prepared to discuss this, too, with high-ranking
                        representatives of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and Great
                        Britain, whom you and Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MHS2">H. Macmillan</persName>
                        propose to send to Moscow. You express the desire that these representatives
                        should have the opportunity to talk with me personally. I agree to this too,
                        if it can be hoped that such meetings would provide useful. With regard to
                        the time of arrival in Moscow of representatives of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and Great Britain, it would be most
                        convenient for us, taking into account other, previously planned,
                        arrangements of foreign-policy character, for them to come, if this is
                        suitable for you as well, let us say, on July 15, 1963. The question of an
                        appropriate announcement in this regard may be agreed upon through
                        diplomatic channels.</p>
                    <p>We should like to count upon the success of the planned exchange of opinions
                        in Moscow on the question of the cessation of nuclear tests. The Soviet
                        Union sincerely wishes to reach agreement as quickly as possible on this
                        question, and is prepared even now to sign an agreement which would prohibit
                        forever the conducting of any and all tests of nuclear weapons. People
                        throughout the world desire the conclusion of such an agreement.
                        Consequently, I cannot be silent about the fact that heavy responsibility
                        would be assumed by those who might continue to impede the achievement of an
                        agreement and, at the same time, in connection with the forthcoming exchange
                        of opinions in Moscow, might sow deceptive illusions among peoples to the
                        effect that the matter was now already approaching a solution of the
                        question of the cessation of tests.</p>
                    <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0318"/>
                    <p>Quite recently we have already had experience on this score which cannot be
                        called anything other than painful. You recall, Mr. President, that after
                        the Soviet Union in December of last year had taken an important step to
                        meet the Western powers in that it agreed to a certain number of
                        inspections, a proposal followed from the Government of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> to send representatives of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to the United States for talks directed
                        toward the most rapid achievement of an agreement. We immediately responded
                        to that proposal and sent our representatives to the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                            >USA</gloss>. The whole world expected that, under the favorable
                        conditions which had developed as a result of our December step, the talks
                        in the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> would be the final step before
                        the signing of a treaty on the cessation of tests.</p>
                    <p>But it turned out quite differently. The Western powers did not wish, as it
                        is our custom to say, “to meet us half way,” but remained on the old,
                        notoriously unacceptable, positions, and, instead of serious political
                        talks, attempted to draw our representatives into discussions of technical
                        details, which could not fail to remain pointless until political questions
                        of principle had been agreed upon. What is more, your representative
                        declared to our representatives that he would have no occasion at all to
                        cross the ocean if the Soviet Union did not intend to accept the demands of
                        the Western powers. It was this sort of position on the part of those with
                        whom we were negotiating which led at that time to the break-down of the
                        talks, which consequently left nothing but disillusionment behind them.</p>
                    <p>A repetition of this sort of experience would only harm the cause, and I
                        should like to express the hope that you are aware of this also. Success now
                        depends only upon the question of what baggage representatives of the
                        Western powers bring with them to Moscow.</p>
                    <p>I am sending a similar message to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"

                            comprehensive agreement on the end of all nuclear testing, and we regret
                            the continuing difference between us on the question of the nature and
                            number of the inspections which would be necessary to give confidence in
                            such a comprehensive agreement. I can only repeat again that there
                            simply is not any interest in using such inspections for espionage of
                            any sort, but I know from your recent statements that you have not
                            accepted this explanation. In these circumstances, I believe that we
                            should continue with our efforts to resolve this difference, but in the
                            meantime I share the view which you have put forward in your important
                            statement in Berlin that it is sensible to reach agreement where
                            agreement is now possible, in the area of testing in the atmosphere,
                            under water, and in outer space. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2"
                                >Harriman</persName> will explain that we continue to be in favor of
                            such a more limited agreement and that we are encouraged by your
                            statement in Berlin to believe that it is now possible.</p>
                        <p>I will not take your time in this letter to go into greater detail on
                            this and other questions, but will merely repeat my conviction that we
                            are at a moment in which it is important to make progress together. For
                            this reason we attach great importance to Mr.<persName corresp="#p_HWA2"
                                >Harriman</persName>'s visit.</p>
                        <p>My wife joins me in sending our good wishes to you, to Mrs. <persName

                    <p>This is a good beginning. I think that you agree with this. Now it seems we
                        can with even greater basis hope that the negotiations which have taken
                        place will have, as you say, serious and positive consequences for the cause
                        of peace.</p>
                    <p>I agree with you that we are living at a time when it is important to achieve
                        progress together in international affairs. It is particularly important, I
                        would say, that this be really tangible and actual progress creating a new
                        situation—a situation of relaxation of tension, thus opening to us the
                        prospect of solution of other pressing problems and questions.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted in this connection as a positive result of the
                        negotiations which have taken place that agreement was reached for
                        continuation of discussion of the question regarding the conclusion of a
                        non-aggression pact between the countries of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> and the states-participants of the Warsaw Treaty with the
                        purpose of achieving agreement.<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3">At the meeting

                    <p>We consider that conclusion of such a pact would fundamentally improve the
                        international atmosphere, would facilitate the strengthening of confidence
                        in relations between states-members of opposing military groups.</p>
                    <p>I recall, Mr. President, that you also have expressed yourself on the
                        usefulness of members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw
                        Pacts taking upon themselves obligations to live in peace with one another
                        and on the readiness of the United States to consider the question of ways
                        of diminishing tensions in relations between <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw Pact.</p>
                    <p>If the conclusion of a treaty for the cessation of nuclear tests were
                        followed by the signing of a pact of non-aggression between the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries and the states of the Warsaw
                        Pact, then this would be not only an important step toward normalization of
                        the entire world situation, but could signify the beginning of a turning
                        point in the history of contemporary international relations, would open the
                        prospect of transition from the state of cold war to one of peaceful
                        co-existence, businesslike cooperation between states.</p>
                    <p>In the meetings with Mr.<persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> I
                        mentioned other possible steps leading in this direction.<note n="4"

                            and discussed Germany and Berlin, Laos, Cuba, and the test ban
                            agreement. Reports on these conversations were transmitted in telegram

                            >544</ref>.</note> I think that by common efforts—and Mr. President, the
                        matter will not be delayed by us—we could, as the military say, building
                        upon our initial success, really make an important contribution to the
                        strengthening of peace throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>We would like to continue the discussion of all these questions with
                        Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">D. Rusk</persName> if he is
                        authorized to do this by you when he comes to Moscow for the signing of the
                        treaty for the cessation of nuclear weapons tests. It is scarcely necessary
                        to say that Mr.<persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> will be received
                        by us with complete cordiality. In conclusion I can testify that
                            Mr.<persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> showed himself to be
                        worthy of the recommendation which you gave him in your letter. Furthermore,
                        we never doubted this. He is really an old friend of ours. He spent a number
                        of years in the Soviet Union, and in his time did a great deal for the
                        development of Soviet/American relations. We remember this and are always
                        pleased to exchange views with him on questions of interest to our two
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Accept, Mr. President, warm greetings and best wishes for you, your wife,
                        your mother whom I met in Vienna, from myself, from my wife Nina Petrovna
                        and from our entire family. Sincerely, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: Availing myself of the return
                        of our Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">A. Dobrynin</persName> to
                        Washington I would like to express some of my thoughts in connection with
                        the state of things shaping up now after the Treaty on banning nuclear
                        weapon tests has been signed in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>I think both of our Governments feel satisfaction with the signing of the
                        Treaty. And this is quite understandable since the Treaty is such a matter
                        which brings no losses to either of the sides; on the contrary, from such an
                        agreement equally win both our countries and other countries of the world,
                        all the mankind.</p>
                    <p>A clear demonstration of the support of this good beginning is in particular
                        also the fact that immediately after the signing of the Treaty by
                        representatives of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Britain many other countries not only
                        declared of their readiness to join that Treaty but have already put their
                        signatures under it. Literally from all corners of the globe the Soviet
                        Government is getting now a flood of letters, messages, congratulations. The
                        White House mail is evidently no less busy. This is one more proof that the
                        wide public of the whole world has received not a small satisfaction and
                        welcomes the agreement of the three Governments which not only cleans the
                        atmosphere of the globe of the poisonous fallout but in a certain sense
                        purifies the international political atmosphere as well. All this
                        strengthens the hopes of the peoples for a further relaxation of tension,
                        gives a prospect of solution of other unsettled questions.</p>
                    <p>So far as I can judge by your statements, Mr. President, as well as by what
                        your Secretary of State Mr.<persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said
                        here, <note n="1" xml:id="d115fn1">For documentation on <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s visit to the Soviet Union, see
                                <ref target="frus1961-63v05">volume V</ref>.</note> you share our
                        conviction that it is important now not to stop at what has been achieved
                        but to make further steps from the good start taken by us. Of course the way
                        ahead of us is not an easy one. However we must follow it stubbornly and
                        persistently—let this be without hurry but there should be no slowing down
                        the pace—consistently striving to solve the ripe international problems
                        which again would correspond to the interests of not only our two countries
                        but also of the whole world.</p>
                    <p>There is hardly need to mention here all these problems once again. We have
                        more than once listed them. I mentioned them in my last conversation with
                            Mr.<persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> too. I would only like to
                        emphasize that these problems <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0327"/>are
                        awaiting their solution. And they should rather be solved without, as it is
                        said, being shelved, they should rather be solved now when a more calm and
                        consequently more favourable atmosphere has been created then under other
                        circumstances which may always arise since serious unsolved problems still
                        remain.</p>
                    <p>Mr.<persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> has certainly had time to
                        inform you about his stay in the Soviet Union and about our talks with him.
                        We consider the Secretary of State's visit to us to be useful. In a short
                        period of time Mr.<persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> in addition to
                        Moscow had a chance to visit Leningrad—the city of great historic
                        traditions, and also to visit the Black Sea shore. As I understood him, he
                        was satisfied with his trip. I was told that the Senators who attended the
                        signing of the Treaty were also satisfied with the trip. I do not know to
                        what extent this may facilitate the process of the ratification of the
                        Treaty by the U.S. Senate but the fact that they visited us and, among other
                        things, had meetings with our deputies to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> Supreme Soviet is in our opinion a positive factor. We
                        have always believed that such contracts promote better understanding.</p>
                    <p>During the talks with the Secretary of State we were able to exchange opinion
                        on a certain number of questions including the questions of bilateral
                        Soviet-American relations. Naturally, an improvement of the relations
                        between our countries would have a beneficial effect and make it easier to
                        look for solutions of the main international problems which divide us
                        now.</p>
                    <p>Mr.<persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> expressed the wish that after
                        his report to you, Mr. President, an exchange of opinion on all such
                        questions should be continued. We agree with this and, moreover, we consider
                        the continuation of the exchange of opinion to be necessary.</p>
                    <p>My wife Nina Petrovna, myself and all our family send you, your wife and your
                        family our regards and best wishes.</p>
                    <p>Accept, Mr. President, our sincere sympathy on the loss that has befallen
                        you—the death of your newly-born son.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had a
                        personal message for the President, and he considered it so confidential,
                        that he had not had it typed but would read from his handwritten notes.</p>
                    <p>He said that the Soviet Government considered that things had recently taken
                        a turn for the better in the international situation and in relations
                        between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the signing of the Test
                        Ban Treaty and the exchange of views with Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, there had developed a relaxation of
                        tension and the prerequisite for the settlement of other questions had been
                        established. This could lead to a real turning point, and the end of the
                        cold war. The Soviet Union took satisfaction from the willingness of the
                        United States to look for the solution of other international problems. If
                        both countries were determined to accomplish this, it was important that
                        nothing be done contrary to this intention. The Soviets wished to tell the
                        President, frankly, what was of concern to them. There were certain facts
                        which did not fit in with the situation and these were the provocative
                        actions against Cuba, which had increased in recent weeks. Unknown planes
                        had shelled industrial establishments and there had been landings of
                        saboteurs on the Cuban coast. These actions had been intensified after the
                        conclusion of the nuclear Test Ban Treaty. It had been stated that the
                        United States had nothing to do with these actions, but no one could believe
                        this. When the United States took a position against the attacks on Soviet
                        ships in Cuban waters, these attacks had stopped. This action had been
                        understood by the Soviet Union as a measure showing the good intentions of
                        the United States. How then could these recent actions be interpreted? If
                        such attacks continued—and they could only be taken from the United States
                        proper or from countries allied with the United States and with the
                        knowledge and connivance of the United States—this could only lead to a new
                        crisis.</p>
                    <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0329"/>
                    <p>The Soviet Union did not want a new crisis to emerge. Both sides had
                        expressed their satisfaction over the elimination of the last crisis, which
                        had been resolved after each side had undertaken certain commitments. The
                        President had said that these commitments should be carried out. The Soviets
                        agreed with this. They believed that for the future of our relations, it was
                        important that effective measures be taken to stop the piratic attacks
                        against Cuba. The Soviet Union had undertaken certain commitments in respect
                        to the protection of the independence of Cuba which were aimed exclusively
                        at preventing Cuba from becoming a victim of aggression, and the Soviet
                        Union would certainly fulfill its commitments if aggression were unleashed
                        against Cuba.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union hoped for understanding of the motives that prompted them to
                        convey to the President, personally from <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">N.S.
                            Khrushchev</persName>, this assessment of the effect of the activation

                    <p>The President wishes Mr.<persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> to
                        know that he shares his view that the signing of the Test Ban Treaty and the
                        recent exchange of views with the Soviet Government is encouraging, and he
                        hopes it will be possible to proceed to the solution of other problems. The
                        President is hopeful that the Test Ban Treaty will be approved by the United
                        States Senate in the course of next week.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the Cuban situation, the President also agrees that the
                        emergence of a new crisis would be in the interest neither of the Soviet
                        Union nor of the United States, and can assure him that the United States
                        will faithfully carry out its commitments.</p>
                    <p>With respect to any air attacks on Cuba, it can be stated categorically that
                        not only was the United States not involved in any way in such attacks, <pb
                            n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0330"/>but has been making every effort to
                        prevent them. It is possible, but not likely, that a light private aircraft
                        could take off from one of the large number of private fields in the
                        southeastern portion of the United States. No such illegal flights have been
                        detected by the means available to us. The President has directed, however,
                        that the measures already taken be reviewed to see what further steps could
                        be taken.</p>
                    <p>In keeping with the March 30, 1963 declaration by the Departments of State
                        and Justice concerning hit and run attacks by Cuban exile groups against
                        targets in Cuba, the law enforcement agencies are taking vigorous measures
                        to assure that the pertinent laws of the United States are observed.</p>
                    <p>Apparently it is assumed that the United States exercises control over the
                        policies and actions of the other sovereign, independent states of this
                        Hemisphere. This assumption betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the
                        relationship between the United States and the other American Republics. The
                        history of inter-American relations makes abundantly clear that the American
                        Governments will not tolerate interference with their foreign or domestic
                        affairs. The states in this Hemisphere jealously defend the principle of
                        juridical equality of states and reject any insinuation that difference of
                        size and power in any way modifies this fundamental rule governing their
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>The United States could, of course, consult with any government in this
                        Hemisphere from whose territory we have information indicating that flights
                        were originating against Cuba, but, in all candor, we must point out that
                        such consultation would be greatly complicated by the increasing sense of
                        outrage among the governments of this Hemisphere about Cuba's deliberate
                        stimulations and support of subversive activities throughout the Hemisphere
                        in direct violation of international norms. This is not simply a matter of
                        speeches or words by <persName corresp="#p_CRF1">Castro</persName>, as has
                        sometimes been indicated. Clear evidence of Cuban involvement in this form
                        of aggression is to be found in the fact that: <list>

                                is the Cuban-trained Peruvians captured on May 14 and 15, 1963, at
                                Puerto Maldonado as they attempted clandestinely to enter Peru from

                                American countries to resort to sabotage, terrorism and guerrilla

                                returned to this theme in his July twenty-sixth address when he
                                called on activists in Venezuela and other countries to “open the
                                breach” and begin fighting. Major Ernesto Guevera, in an article
                                published in the September issues of Cuba Socialista, strongly
                                advocates guerrilla warfare as the surest road to power in Latin
                                America. Information available to us shows a direct connection
                                between terroristic activities in Venezuela and the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CRF1">Castro</persName> regime. In addition to being
                                guilty of such aggression against other American Republics by
                                promoting these and other activities, the Cuban Government recently
                                embarked on a most risky venture of direct violation of the
                                territory and territorial waters of another country in this
                                Hemisphere using units of its armed forces. On August 14, 1963, a
                                Cuban helicopter and two patrol boats furnished by the Soviet Union
                                forcibly removed from Cay Anguila, one of the islands of the Bahamas
                                group, nineteen persons who had sought refuge on the island. This
                                incident led to a vigorous protest by the British Government on
                                August 21, 1963, requesting an apology and return of the persons

                        capitals—Moscow, Washington and London, carrying out the final act in
                        connection with the conclusion of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in
                        the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Underwater—the ratification instruments
                        of the original parties to this treaty, the Soviet Union, the United States
                        of America and Great Britain have been deposited.</p>
                    <p>Thus the Nuclear Weapon Test Ban Treaty has come into force. This undoubtedly
                        is a significant development in international affairs which brings joy to
                        all peoples. Together with the Soviet Union, the United States of America
                        and Great Britain the Nuclear Weapon Test Ban Treaty has been signed by more
                        than one hundred states. It can be said with assurance that this treaty has
                        found warm response and approval among all peoples of good will.</p>
                    <p>It has been repeatedly noted by representatives of our countries that the
                        Test Ban Treaty is in itself a document of great international significance
                        and the hope has been expressed that the conclusion of this treaty will have
                        a positive influence on the international climate, on relations between
                        states. Actually, the conclusion of the Nuclear Weapon Test Ban Treaty has
                        injected a fresh spirit into the international atmosphere showing that no
                        matter how complicated contemporary problems, no matter how great the
                        differences between social systems of our states, we can find mutually
                        acceptable solutions in the interests of all mankind, in the interests of
                        maintaining peace if we manifest the necessary push (<hi rend="italic"
                            >stremleniye</hi>) toward this end.</p>
                    <p>But, it is understood, agreement on banning experimental nuclear explosions
                        with all its importance for peoples, in itself does not solve the principal
                        international problem of our epoch—does not eliminate the danger of war. Now
                        it is necessary—and our governments have spoken out in favor of this—to
                        develop further the success that we have achieved, to seek solutions of
                        other ripe international questions.</p>
                    <p>These questions are well known, they have been brought forward by life
                        itself, by the whole development of world events. They concern the
                        strengthening of security in Europe, including the liquidation of the
                        remnants of the Second World War, conclusion of a non-aggression pact
                        between countries of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and member states
                        of the Warsaw Pact, creation of nuclear free zones in various regions of the
                        world, barring the further spread of the nuclear weapon, banning of
                        launching into orbit objects bearing nuclear weapons, measures for the
                        prevention of surprise attack, and a series of other steps. Their
                        implementation would facilitate a significant strengthening of peace,
                        improvement of international relations, would clear the road to general and
                        complete disarmament, and, consequently, to the delivering of peoples from
                        the threat of war.</p>
                    <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0333"/>
                    <p>Peoples expect that our governments will now manifest still more persistence
                        and consistency in their further activities in the interests of
                        consolidating peace. So far as the Soviet Government is concerned,
                        inalterably following the course of peaceful coexistence of states, it is
                        prepared to exert new efforts, to do everything dependent on it in order
                        that the change for the better in the international situation which has been
                        noted as a result of the conclusion of the Nuclear Weapon Test Ban Treaty
                        should become the beginning of a sharp turn toward broad relaxation of
                        international tension.</p>
                    <p>Permit me, Mr. President, to express the hope that the Government of the
                        United States of America for its part will make an appropriate contribution
                        to the solution of international problems which is demanded by the interests
                        of weakening international tensions, the interests of insuring universal

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I am writing this message to
                        you at a moment that holds a special place in the history of your country.
                        The villainous assassination of Head of the American State <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF2">John F. Kennedy</persName> is a grievous, indeed a
                        very grievous loss for your country. I want to say frankly that the gravity
                        of this loss is felt by the whole world, including ourselves, the Soviet
                        people.</p>
                    <p>There is no need for me to tell you that the late President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF2">John F. Kennedy</persName> and I, as the Head of the
                        Government of the socialist Soviet Union, were people of different poles.
                        But I believe that probably you yourself have formed a definite view that it
                        was an awareness of the great responsibility for the destinies of the world
                        that guided the actions of the two Governments—both of the Soviet Union and
                        of the United States—in recent <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0334"
                        />years. These actions were founded on a desire to prevent a disaster and to
                        resolve disputed issues through agreement with due regard for the most
                        important, the most fundamental interests of ensuring peace.</p>
                    <p>An awareness of this responsibility, which I found <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF2">John F. Kennedy</persName> to possess during our very
                        first conversations in Vienna in 1961, laid down the unseen bridge of mutual
                        understanding which, I venture to say, was not broken to the very last day
                        in the life of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">John F.
                            Kennedy</persName>. For my own part, I can say quite definitely that the
                        feeling of respect for the late President never left me precisely because,
                        like ourselves, he based his policy on a desire not to permit a military
                        collision of the major powers which carry on their shoulders the burden of
                        the responsibility for the maintenance of peace.</p>
                    <p>And now, taking the opportunity offered by the visit to the United States of
                        my First Deputy <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">A.I. Mikoyan</persName> to
                        attend the funeral of <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">John F.
                        Kennedy</persName>, I address these lines to you, as the new President of
                        the United States of America in whom is vested a high responsibility to your
                        people. I do not know how you will react to these words of mine, but let me
                        say outright that in you we saw a comrade-in-arms of the late President, a
                        man who always stood at the President's side and supported his line in
                        foreign policy. This, I believe, gives us grounds to express the hope that
                        the basis, which dictated to the leaders of both countries the need not to
                        permit the outbreak of a new war and to keep the peace, will continue to be
                        the determining factor in the development of relations between our two
                        States.</p>
                    <p>Needless to say, on our part, and on my own part, as Head of the Government
                        of the Soviet Union, there has been and remains readiness to find, through
                        an exchange of views, mutually acceptable solutions for those problems which
                        still divide us. This applies both to the problems of European security,
                        which have been handed down to the present generation chiefly as a legacy of
                        World War II, and to other international problems.</p>
                    <p>Judging by experience, exchanges of views and our contacts can assume various
                        forms, including such an avenue as the exchange of personal messages, if
                        this does not run counter to your wishes.</p>
                    <p>Recently we marked the Thirtieth Anniversary of the establishment of
                        diplomatic relations between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. This was a historic
                        act in which an outstanding role was played by President Franklin D.
                        Roosevelt. We have always believed that, being a representative of one and
                        the same political party, the late President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                            >John F. Kennedy</persName> to a certain extent continued in foreign
                        policy Roosevelt's traditions which were based on recognition of the fact
                        that the coinciding interests of the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. prevail over all
                        that divides them.</p>
                    <p>And it is to you Mr. President, as to a representative of the same trend of
                        the United States policy which brought into the political forefront <pb
                            n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0335"/>statesmen, such as Franklin D.
                        Roosevelt and <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">John F. Kennedy</persName>, that I
                        want to say that if these great traditions could go on being maintained and
                        strengthened, both Americans and Soviet people could, we are convinced, look
                        optimistically into the future. We are convinced that this development of
                        events would meet the sympathy of every state, and indeed of every
                        individual who espouses and cherishes peace.</p>
                    <p>I would welcome any desire on your part to express your ideas in connection
                        with the thoughts—though they may, perhaps, be of a somewhat general
                        nature—which I deemed it possible to share with you in this message.<note

                    <p>He looked so upset when he came through the line, and I was very moved.</p>
                    <p>I tried to give him a message for you that day—but as it was such a terrible
                        day for me, I do not know if my words came out as I meant them to.</p>
                    <p>So now, in one of the last nights I will spend in the White House, in one of
                        the last letters I will write on this paper at the White House, I would like
                        to write you my message.</p>
                    <p>I send it only because I know how much my husband cared about peace, and how
                        the relation between you and him was central to this care in his mind. He
                        used to quote your words in some of his speeches-”In the next war the
                        survivors will envy the dead.”</p>
                    <p>You and he were adversaries, but you were allied in a determination that the
                        world should not be blown up. You respected each other and could deal with
                        each other. I know that President <persName>Johnson</persName> will make
                        every effort to establish the same relationship with you.</p>
                    <p>The danger which troubled my husband was that war might be started not so
                        much by the big men as by the little ones.</p>
                    <p>While big men know the needs for self-control and restraint—little men are
                        sometimes moved more by fear and pride. If only in the future the big men
                        can continue to make the little ones sit down and talk, before they start to
                        fight.</p>
                    <p>I know that President <persName>Johnson</persName> will continue the policy
                        in which my husband so deeply believed—a policy of control and restraint—and
                        he will need your help.</p>
                    <p>I send this letter because I know so deeply of the importance of the
                        relationship which existed between you and my husband, and also because of
                        your kindness, and that of Mrs. Khrushcheva in Vienna.</p>
                    <p>I read that she had tears in her eyes when she left the American Embassy in
                        Moscow, after signing the book of mourning. Please thank her for that.</p>
