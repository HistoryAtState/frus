                <p>The publication Foreign Relations of the United States constitutes the official
                    record of the foreign policy of the United States. The volumes in the series
                    include, subject to necessary security considerations, all documents needed to
                    give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy decisions of the United
                    States together with appropriate materials concerning the facts that contributed
                    to the formulation of policies. Documents in the files of the Department of
                    State are supplemented by papers from other government agencies involved in the
                    formulation of foreign policy. This volume also includes documents from the
                    private collections of various government officials connected with U.S. policy
                    toward Vietnam.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series is
                    edited by the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of
                    State. The editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in
                    accordance with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary
                    of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925:</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating the place
                    in the text where the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of
                    major importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose
                    of concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons:</p>
                <p>a. To avoid publication of matters that would tend to impede current diplomatic
                    negotiations or other business.</p>
                <p>b. To condense the record and avoid repetition of needless details.</p>
                <p>c. To preserve the confidence reposed in the Department by individuals and by
                    foreign governments.</p>
                <p>d. To avoid giving needless offense to other nationalities or individuals.</p>
                <p>e. To eliminate personal opinions presented in despatches and not acted upon by
                    the Department. To this consideration there is one qualification: in connection
                    with major decisions it is desirable, where possible, to show the alternative
                    presented to the Department before the decision was made.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Principles of Selection for Foreign Relations, 1961-1963,
                    Volume IV</p>
                <p>Document selection for this volume proceeded on the basis of a research plan
                    developed by the editors after a preliminary review of repositories in both
                    governmental and private agencies. From the outset the editors approached their
                    research realizing the need to supplement the written record of U.S. policy
                    during the Vietnam war with interviews of officials who participated in the
                    policy process. Early attention was also given to those oral history interviews
                    of participants already in existence and available in various locations. Oral
                    history citations are provided in the footnotes to the text.</p>
                <p>On the basis of their preliminary research and review of already-published
                    documentation, including the 1971 “Pentagon Papers,” the editors developed the
                    following five areas of focus for the research and selection of documents for
                    inclusion in this volume: 1) Discussion and formulation of policy in Washington;
                    2) Policy implementation in South Vietnam; 3) The relationship among the United
                    States Government, the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government,
                    and dissident elements in South Vietnam; 4) U.S. intelligence assessments of the
                    viability of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government and the
                    prospects of potential coup plotters; and 5) U.S. military involvement in
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Discussion and formulation of policy in Washington: President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName> and, after his assassination on
                    November 22, 1963, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName>, made the important policy decisions on Vietnam. They
                    received advice from the Washington foreign affairs community, either orally at
                    meetings or in documents. The records of these meetings with the Presidents and
                    advice provided to them in writing are the focus of this volume. The editors are
                    confident that they have had complete access to all the Presidential written
                    records bearing on Vietnam.</p>
                <p>The most important repositories for records on the formulation of U.S. policy
                    toward Vietnam are the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName>
                    and <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> Presidential
                    Libraries. The records of the Department of State, to which the editors had
                    complete access, include a large segment of Presidential and National Security
                    Council documentation, but the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                    and <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> Libraries remain the single
                    most comprehensive sources. The papers of the President's Military
                    Representative, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Maxwell D.
                        Taylor</persName>, at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C.,
                    are also of unusual importance. The documents in the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Papers provide a unique record of
                        <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s advice to the President on
                    Vietnam and records of some meetings both at the White House and at the
                    Department of Defense for which there are no other accounts. Department of
                    Defense records, especially files and papers of Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">Robert S. McNamara</persName>, located at the Washington
                    National Records Center, are an important subsidiary source. A private <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>collection, the <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">W.
                        Averell Harriman</persName> Papers, are also of considerable interest. Used
                    with the permission of the late Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> when they were still in his possession, they are now
                    housed at the Library of Congress, Manuscript Division. The <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Roger Hilsman</persName> papers, located at the Kennedy
                    Library, also proved an important source of documents not found in official
                    files.</p>
                <p>Policy implementation in Vietnam: The editors also selected documentation that
                    covered the implementation of Presidentially-established policy and a small
                    range of lesser policy decisions that did not reach the White House or were
                    resolved in the Department of State or other agencies of the foreign affairs
                    community. The files of the Department of State, the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                    Libraries, and the United States Information Agency are the primary documentary
                    sources for these decisions.</p>
                <p>The relationship among the United States Government, the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government, and dissident elements in
                    South Vietnam: From late August 1963, when this volume begins, to the overthrow
                    of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government on November 1,
                    1963, the United States strongly supported the Republic of Vietnam, but the
                    relationship was strained. The extensive reports of U.S. Embassy relations with
                    the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government come primarily from
                    the central files of the Department of State.</p>
                <p>The fact that the United States was in close contact with dissident elements in
                    South Vietnam makes events in Saigon crucial to understanding U.S. policy. The
                    editors have, therefore, included a considerable number of telegraphic reports
                    from the Embassy and the Central Intelligence Agency Station in Saigon on
                    relations with dissident Vietnamese. Central Intelligence Agency records were
                    obtained from the Kennedy Library, Department of State files, the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Papers, Department of Defense records,
                    and the Joint Chiefs of Staff files. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                    provided full access to the Department historians to Agency documents in the
                    Presidential libraries, and many of these documents are printed here. Some
                    access was eventually provided to documentation retained by the Agency itself,
                    but too late for documents to be included in this volume. Significant
                    declassified material obtained from the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                    archives for 1963 will be printed in a subsequent volume in the Foreign
                    Relations series.</p>
                <p>U.S. intelligence estimates of the viability of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government and the potential prospects of coup plotters:
                    The ability of the U.S. Government to estimate the viability of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government and the prospects for
                    potential coup plotters are of central importance during a period in which there
                    was extensive planning for a coup and then a successful overthrow of President
                        <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. This volume and its companion,
                    documenting the first part of 1963 (volume III), include communications between
                    the Central Intelligence Agency and its Station in <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>Saigon. In addition to these telegrams, a representative
                    selection of finished intelligence assessments prepared by the U.S. intelligence
                    community is printed.</p>
                <p>U.S. military involvement in Vietnam: The editors sought to include documentation
                    that illustrated the relationship between military planning and strategy and the
                    conduct of relations with the Republic of Vietnam and other countries. No
                    attempt was made to document operational details of U.S. military involvement in
                    Vietnam. The <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Papers, the files of
                    the Secretary of Defense and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
                    International Security Affairs at the Washington National Records Center, and
                    the decentralized files of the Department of State's Vietnam Working Group are
                    the principal sources for this topic.</p>
                <p>The question of press coverage of developments in Vietnam and U.S. involvement
                    became less sensitive during the latter part of 1963, but still remained an
                    important issue. Documentation relating to public affairs and press relations is
                    located in the files of the United States Information Agency.</p>
                <p>The editors of the volume are confident that the documents printed here provide a
                    comprehensive and accurate foreign affairs record of United States policy toward
                    and involvement in Vietnam during the last four months of 1963. The
                    declassification review process for the documents selected for this volume,
                    outlined in more detail below, resulted in withholding from publication only 1.7
                    percent of the original manuscript.</p>
                <p>The editors wish to acknowledge the assistance of officials at the National
                    Archives and Records Administration's <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F.
                        Kennedy</persName> Library and <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName> Libraries, in particular Suzanne Forbes and David
                    Humphry. Susan Lemke at the National Defense University and Sandra Meagher at
                    the Department of Defense deserve special thanks, as do former government
                    officials who consented to oral history interviews for this volume.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Incoming telegrams from U.S. missions are placed according to time of receipt in
                    the Department of State or other receiving agency, rather than the time of
                    transmission; memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and
                    date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted. The
                    editors were not always able to determine the precise chronological order of
                    documents produced during periods of crisis and intense activity, particularly
                    during the November 1 coup. In these cases they used their best judgment.</p>
                <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the Foreign Relations series
                    follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the Editor in
                    Chief and the chief technical editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly
                    as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the
                    footnotes. Obvious typographical errors are corrected, but other mistakes and
                    omissions in the source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction
                    is set in italic type; an omission in roman type. Bracketed insertions are also
                    used to indicate text that has been omitted because it deals with an unrelated
                    subject (in roman type) or because it remained classified after the
                    declassification review process (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. All ellipses and brackets that appear in the source text
                    are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. The source footnote also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates if the
                    President and/or his major policy advisers read it. Every effort has been made
                    to determine if a document has been previously published and this information
                    has been included in the source footnote. If two or more different accounts of a
                    meeting or event of comparable value are available and one or more is already
                    declassified and published, the editors chose to print the still unpublished one
                    and obtain its declassification.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in this volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and summarize and provide citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when applicable to
                    supplement the official record.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review Procedures</p>
                <p>Declassification review of the documents selected for publication was conducted
                    by the Division of Historical Documents Review, Bureau of Diplomatic Security,
                    Department of State. The review was made in accordance with the Freedom of
                    Information Act, the Privacy Act, and the criteria established in Executive
                    Order 12356 regarding:</p>
                <p>1) military plans, weapons, or operations;</p>
                <p>2) the vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, projects, or
                    plans relating to the national security;</p>
                <p>3) foreign government information;</p>
                <p>4) intelligence activities (including special activities), or intelligence
                    sources or methods;</p>
                <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0008"/>
                <p>5) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States;</p>
                <p>6) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to national
                    security;</p>
                <p>7) U.S. Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;</p>
                <p>8) cryptology; and</p>
                <p>9) a confidential source.</p>
                <p>Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic and
                    functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of the
                    U.S. Government, and appropriate foreign governments regarding documents of
                    those governments. The principle guiding declassification review is to release
                    as much information as is consistent with contemporary requirements of national
                    security and sound foreign relations.</p>
                <p>Edward C. Keefer compiled and edited the volume under the supervision of Charles
                    S. Sampson, the Vietnam project leader, and Editor in Chief John P. Glennon.
                    Suzanne E. Coffman of the Office of the Historian prepared the lists of names
                    and abbreviations. Rita M. Baker performed the technical editing. Barbara A.

                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Subject-Numeric Indexed Central Files</hi>. In February
                    1963, the Department changed its decimal central files to a subject-numeric
                    central file system. This volume and its companion, volume III, are the first to
                    be published in the Foreign Relations series in which the Department's central
                    files come exclusively from the new system. As part of the transition from the
                    old to two system, the Department of State encouraged its indexers to cross
                    references extensively and to include the first page of the referenced document
                    in the cross referenced file. The system allows the researcher to begin in a
                    basic file and by noting the cross references discover other pertinent
                    files.</p>
                <p>The subject-numeric system was divided into broad categories: Administration,
                    Consular, Culture and Information, Economic, Political and Defense, Science, and
                    Social. Within each of these divisions were subcategories. For example,
                    Political and Defense contained four subtopics: POL (politics), DEF (Defense),
                    CSM (Communism), and INT (Intelligence). Numerical subdivisions further defined
                    them. For example, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15-1 was used for
                    documentation concerning the head of state and/or the Executive Branch of any
                    country. Therefore <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15-1 <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss> VIET contains documentation on South Vietnam's
                    President; <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15-1 CAMB would contain
                    documentation of Cambodia's Head of State, Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Norodom Sihanouk</persName>.</p>

                            U.S. forces in the area available to evacuate Americans in Vietnam, if
                            required. He said 3000 to 4000 evacuees could be airlifted by U.S.
                            forces now in Vietnam. Other U.S. forces are being moved closer to
                            Saigon so that they can respond more <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0028"/>quickly and move a larger number of people. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> has expressed his concern that
                            the airlift capability is inadequate. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> is engaged now in figuring out
                            ways of increasing the number of Americans who could be removed from
                            dangerous areas promptly in an emergency. The airlift in Vietnam outside
                            of Saigon is substantial. In response to a question, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said there were over 4000
                            Americans in Saigon, excluding the military.<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName>'s memorandum for the
                                record is the most detailed of the three versions of this meeting.

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said that
                            Vietnamese forces loyal to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            in the Saigon area outnumbered two to one the forces we believed would
                            follow rebel generals in the event of a coup. Outside of Saigon, the
                            forces controlled by generals who might rebel outnumbered <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s forces. He concluded that in
                            the long run the forces controlled by rebel generals would outnumber
                            forces which would remain loyal to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. He cautioned that a head count of troops was not
                            all-important because a small number of tough units could control the
                            situation even though outnumbered by less well-trained forces.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> is the key to the
                            situation. [<hi rend="italic">1 sentence (1-1/2 lines) not

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that, as
                            he pointed out yesterday, he believed that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> knew
                            of our activity with the generals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> reported that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> had suggested that we or they
                            leak to the press the movement of the 7th Fleet to a position off
                            Saigon. The President doubted this suggestion should be approved because
                            our fleet movement would appear to be such obvious evidence of an
                            intention of the U.S. to intervene militarily in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that he
                            believed we should decide first whether we are backing the Vietnamese
                            generals in their effort to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. If we are, then we should plan how to induce
                            doubtful generals to defect. In his view, events have almost pulled us
                            along in the last twenty-four hours.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that it would be
                            difficult if not impossible for us to live with a situation in which
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was ascendant in Vietnam.
                            He believed we had no option but to back a coup. We are already beyond
                            the point of no return. The question is how do we make this coup effort
                            successful.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he believed
                            that we should not proceed as if we were being pushed. If we decided to
                            back a coup we should go in to win. The cables he had read from Saigon
                            raised doubt in his mind that the coup generals could overthrow
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. At least initially,
                            forces loyal to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> can
                            overpower forces opposing him.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0029"/>
                        <p>The President noted that both Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> had recommended that we go ahead. He did not
                            believe we should take the position that we have to go ahead because we
                            have gone so far already. If a coup is not in the cards, we could
                            unload. The generals talking about a coup did not appear to be very
                            enthusiastic.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> commented on the consequences of backing
                            off vs. the consequences of going forward. He believed we should decide
                            today what we should do to defect the generals. Every time we act to
                            help the rebel generals we reduce our freedom to choose between going
                            ahead or breaking off efforts to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that one major
                            change which we could make would be to instruct our military officers to
                            talk to the generals. Up to this point, we had had no contact with the
                            coup generals except through <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            officials. Until our military officers contact the generals, several
                            generals who we now consider doubtful would not shift to supporting the
                            group planning to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that we had asked General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> twice if he approved of our
                            going ahead in support of a coup. Both Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> say we should support the
                            rebel generals.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's question, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said he was surprised when he
                            reamed that General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            favored our supporting a coup. Further encouragement to the generals
                            opposing <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> runs counter to
                            our agreement on continuing economic assistance which we reached with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> some time ago.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> foresaw at that time a
                            disagreement with the U.S. about how they were running the internal
                            affairs of Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said
                            he had grave reservations about proceeding against <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. The good faith of the U.S. is
                            involved. In addition, he had given personal commitments to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> which were based on instructions
                            sent to him from Washington when he was Ambassador. We should not
                            support a coup in the expectation that we can get another government
                            which we can deal with and a base on which we can win the war against
                            the Viet Cong. Supporting a coup is bad in principle and sets a bad
                            precedent. The alternatives he saw are three:</p>
                        <p>1. To decide to support the coup generals and help them line up a
                            preponderance of force so that there would be a quick takeover.</p>
                        <p>2. Back off from contacts already made with dissident generals, which he
                            admitted would be difficult to do.</p>
                        <p>3. Leave the dissident generals alone and, if they have the guts to
                            attempt a coup, support them at that time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> called attention to the difference between
                            gaining operational control of a coup and the present situation in which
                            we are merely telling the generals that we understand how they feel
                            about <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and that we can't
                            live with the Nhus.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0030"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said there were some
                            things we could do in which the U.S. hand would not show.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, commenting on Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>'s statement, said
                            Diem had broken promises he had made to us. The actions they are taking
                            are in violation of good faith. He was not sympathetic to the allegation
                            that we were breaking commitments. He cited reports which indicate that
                            Diem and his followers are taking anti-American actions. He saw the
                            situation as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. We can't win the war against the Communists with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in control. The U.S. position in
                            the eyes of the world is being badly damaged. Hence, we can't back off
                            from our all-out opposition to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. If we merely let the generals proceed and then, if they fail to
                            overthrow <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, we have lost as
                            well. This outcome is half-baked and no good.</p>
                        <p>3. We decide to do the job right. There is no other acceptable
                            alternative. We must decide now to go through to a successful overthrow
                            of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Harriman stated his agreement with the position expressed by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> commented that if
                            anything starts it will be labeled as a U.S. show from the very
                            beginning. If we decide to back the rebel generals we must do whatever
                            is required to be certain they succeed in overthrowing <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President said we should decide what we can do here or suggest things
                            that can be done in the field which would maximize the chances of the
                            rebel generals. We should ask Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> how we can build up military forces which would
                            carry out a coup. At present, it does not look as if the coup forces
                            could defeat <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> interrupted to
                            say, “Then don't go.”</p>
                        <p>The President asked the Defense Department to come up with ways of
                            building up the anti-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> forces
                            in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> was asking standby
                            authority:</p>
                        <p>1. To suspend all economic aid to the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government, but continue aid by giving it directly
                            to the generals.</p>
                        <p>2. To suspend all U.S. operations in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. To assist the coup generals by making U.S. military equipment
                            available to them.</p>
                        <p>4. To make a public announcement that the U.S. was supporting the forces
                            trying to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> thought we
                            should tell Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>:</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0031"/>
                        <p>1. Don't let a coup start if they think it can't win because we can't
                            live with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> if a coup attempt
                            is made and the coup fails. He questions whether, on the basis of the
                            forces now available to the rebel generals, a coup can succeed.</p>
                        <p>2. We need a list of actions which would be of help to the coup generals,
                            such as ways of gaining support from now doubtfu1 generals and the
                            movement of U.S. fleet units.<note n="5" xml:id="d1fn5">See <ref target="#d2">Document 2</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> commented that most generals favor a coup
                            and pointed out that the U.S. controls all military assistance being
                            given to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said that we have
                            lost Vietnam if the coup fails. He believes we cannot win the war with
                            the Nhus. We have lost the fight in Vietnam and must withdraw if a coup
                            does not take place. We put <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            in power and he has double-crossed us. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and his followers have betrayed us. He favored
                            removing <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and felt that it was
                            a mistake that we had not acted a long time ago. We had made a mistake
                            in working with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> on the
                            strategic hamlet plan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that we can't
                            stop the generals now and that they must go forward or die. He agreed
                            that we cannot win the war unless <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is removed.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said we had been winning the war with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> because the generals were with
                            him. The generals are defecting now because of the recent actions which
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had taken against the
                            Buddhists. In the present situation, the opposition to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> can be rallied.</p>
                        <p>The President thought we should go back to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> again, telling them that
                            counting up the forces favoring <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and the forces opposing <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, it was clear that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> held the balance of power.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said our request of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> should be specific in that we
                            should ask them how they evaluate the pro-Diem and anti-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> forces. He noted that both
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> counted heavily on
                            the caliber of the various troops.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General expressed his concern as to whether we knew what we
                            would do if <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> acted to
                            destroy the coup before the generals were ready to pull it off. He noted
                            that some people thought <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            knew already of the coup plans. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would know that if the coup were successful he
                            would be finished. and, therefore, he would obviously try to break up a
                            coup by arresting the generals before they were ready. He thought we
                            should figure out how we could offset any action of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to destroy the forces opposing
                            him.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> asked what
                            condition Vietnam would be in if a coup is successful. He was not clear
                            whether the resulting government would bring about stable leadership or
                            whether the rebelling generals would be unable to agree on who should be
                            the leader.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said the generals
                            could put the Vice President of Vietnam in power and govern the country
                            the way the generals have in Korea. He acknowledged that we have little
                            information about how the generals plan to run the country if they are
                            successful. He expressed his strong view that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would have to be exiled.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that only
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> can hold this
                            fragmented country together.<note n="6" xml:id="d1fn6">See <ref target="#d2">Document 2</ref>.</note> Possibly <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> could get <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and his wife to leave, but he
                            doubted this would be possible. We should try once again to persuade
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to remove <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> had chosen not to try to do this
                            for fear of exposing the coup generals to a sudden reaction by <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> if <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> refused to remove the Nhus.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> stated his
                            disagreement. The political situation in Vietnam will blow up sometime.
                            We have in Vietnam a situation similar to that which existed in Korea
                            under Syngman Rhee. The political forces in Vietnam will rally quickly
                            against <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was not anti-American nor
                            is <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President asked that the group adjourn now, to meet again at 6:00

                            the meeting reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> described the Saigon
                            situation as generally unchanged, with minor troop movements in the
                            Saigon area, relaxation of restrictions and some release of prisoners.
                            In the hinterland there has been a slow drop in the offensive
                            operations, but not dramatically so. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> released a statement by the Joint General Staff that
                            the military did participate in the pagoda raids and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> seems to be actively engaged in
                            generating favorable statements from the Buddhists.</p>

                            response to the State query regarding the situation and mentioned
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s dissatisfaction
                            with a telegram that he had received from Laguna Beach, purportedly from
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, urging
                            replacement of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            government. The President asked how this could be explained, to which
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Helms</persName> replied that the Station
                            Chief could handle it easily.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> discussed the matter of
                            the balance of forces in the Saigon area, reciting the content of
                            messages which all present had on the subject. He was emphatic in
                            stating that the point of no return had been reached.” (Memorandum for

                        <p>Later in the meeting, evacuation planning was discussed; see <ref target="#d1fn5">footnote 5, Document 1</ref>. <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName>'s memorandum for the record
                            reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> discussed the
                            matter of military capabilities for protection and evacuation, referring
                            to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s question
                            as to the adequacy of US military forces in the region. He pointed out
                            that the reaction time of the BLT task group offshore had been reduced
                            from 48 to 24 hours; that the shipping involved could readily lift
                            several thousand evacuees and the people could be moved much closer to
                            the coast. He discussed the location of the CVA task group and stated
                            that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> what further changes are required
                            in response to the concern expressed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> continued, noting that there
                            were <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0034"/>4 BLTs on Okinawa on 24-hour
                            alert; that C-130 aircraft were in the process of being assembled at
                            Okinawa, and that all related plans were being reviewed.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> added that a most
                            important asset is the helicopters and C-123s already in-country, which
                            could be used to move refugees either into the countryside or to ships
                            at sea. He commented that the US forces present in Vietnam are of
                            neither the type nor the size which warranted consideration for
                            participation in large scale fighting.</p>
                        <p>“The President raised the question of the Embassy evacuation plan, to
                            which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> replied
                            that it had been recently brought up to date and reorganized. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, from his notes,
                            recited key parts of the plan.”</p>
                        <p>Regarding possible United States actions which might be of assistance to
                            the “coup generals” (see <ref target="#d1fn5">footnote 5, Document
                                1</ref>), <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>'s record
                            included the following exchange between the President and <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>:</p>
                        <p>“The President asked <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> what
                            ideas State had for swinging over the uncommitted generals, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> replied that we had a
                            number of ideas including suitably discreet comments about the US
                            attitude towards the Nhus to generals such as <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>, the leaks about the presence of
                            the Seventh Fleet and other US forces, [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] and that State intended to work out with Defense
                            and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> some suggestions along these
                            lines.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> also questioned the
                            Secretary of Defense's assumption that we could prevent the coup from
                            starting at this stage. He felt that, as we had said before in the
                            meeting, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> were undoubtedly aware that coup
                            plotting was going on and that the generals probably now had no
                            alternative to going ahead except that of fleeing the country. The
                            President said that he was not sure that we were in that deep. As he
                            understood it, only two contacts by two <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> men had been made with two Vietnamese generals. This

                            field that the coup would not work.”</p>
                        <p>At the end of the meeting Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> made a statement that “only <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> can hold this fragmented country
                            together” (see <ref target="#d1fn7">footnote 7, Document 1</ref>). In
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>'s record this
                            statement and the subsequent disagreement between <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> are recorded as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> again intervened
                            saying that he profoundly felt that only <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> could hold this fragmented country together.</p>
                        <p>“The President said, ‘Even without the Nhus?' <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> replied that he thought
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> could be
                            persuaded to remove Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            from the scene and at least to make brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> less conspicuous.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said emphatically that
                            he disagreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>'s
                            estimate-that attempting to go along with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            spelled nothing but disaster.</p>

                        <p>“With some heat Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said
                            that he had disagreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> from the beginning when he first assumed office
                            as Assistant Secretary; that he felt he was profoundly wrong about this;
                            and that he was sorry to have to be so blunt about saying this.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that he wished
                            to associate himself with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>; that he felt given the history of the past few
                            days a <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> government could not in the long
                            run win. Furthermore, looking to the other countries in this area, he
                            wanted to point out that the consequences of the US acquiescing in the
                            continuation of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> in a
                            commanding position and acceptance of the desecration of the temples
                            would make our task more difficult through Asia. He thought the
                            President would be interested to know that the Koreans had ordered a
                            special study of US-South Viet-Nam relations in order to decide how much
                            repression the US would tolerate, to serve as a guide for Korean actions
                            in the upcoming elections.”</p>

                        <p>A. Though some easing of martial law was evident in Saigon yesterday,
                            steps were being taken to tighten the security ring around the
                            Presidential Palace, which houses <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and the Nhus.</p>
                        <p>B. The Palace security guard, normally provided by an elite Army unit, is
                            now, we hear, being drawn from units under Colonel <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName>, the pro-regime commander of the
                            Special Forces. In addition anti-aircraft guns have been emplaced in the
                            Palace area.</p>
                        <p>C. Meantime, the shadow of <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh
                                Nhu</persName> looms ever larger. His picture has begun to show up
                            in public buildings—one report says <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s is coming down—and a million posters of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, resplendent in his Youth Corps
                            uniform, have been made up for nationwide distribution.</p>
                        <p>D. Some Army leaders fear that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            plans a further power grab.</p>
                        <p>E. Military operations against the Viet Cong continue, but martial law
                            commitments led to the suspension of a large-scale operation in central
                            Vietnam and the number of small-scale government actions has
                            declined.</p>

                            I too had second thoughts even when I saw State 243 in that it was a bit
                            contradictory. On the one hand it gave Diem a chance yet at the same
                            time it told military to go ahead. The <gloss target="#t_AMB1">Amb</gloss> made decision after receiving approval of modification
                            that his instructions were clear to go ahead on military side. This was

                            have always been of opinion and have so stated in past few days that

                        <p>Now the die is cast though as yet we have not received the details of how
                            it's to be done—and in the final analysis, in my opinion, it will not be
                            accomplished unless we give the final say so.</p>
                        <p>I feel the key to the whole solution is the elimination of the Nhus from
                            active participation in affairs Vietnam. By elimination I do not mean
                            destruction. I hope that we could even pay for a protracted leave of
                            absence from the post to someplace where their voice of authority could
                            not be heard.</p>
                        <p>I have the feeling that the military involved could live with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> provided the Nhus were out of the
                            picture. Though I agreed to the change in the terms of reference I based
                            my agreement on the fact that in the past when we have tried to separate
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> from the Nhus, either
                            in action or statement, the result has been nil. On the other hand I too
                            have second thought that we never actually have given <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> a chance to react to any new
                            instructions or advice <gloss target="#t_AMB1">Amb</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> might have imparted to
                            him. I have not had a chance to discuss this with the <gloss target="#t_AMB1">Amb</gloss> and therefore do not know <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> reaction to the initial
                            conversations. I do know that the feelings here, both in the military
                            and civilian, run high against the Nhus—and from reading reports from
                            world wide sources there is a great deal of concern and confusion as to
                            just who is running Vietnam. At this time people are choosing sides and
                            the various factions are lining up one against the other. Again, at this
                            time, it is not at all clear what the line-up will be. <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> has asked to meet with
                                <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> in the morning. Purpose of the
                            meeting is unknown. It might clarify some of the unknowns.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion as things stand now I don't believe there is sufficient
                            reason for a crash approval on our part at this time.</p>
                        <p>If, as reported and not absolutely confirmed, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and cohorts have taken enough action in the eyes of
                            the civilians and military here—and the world—to put themselves way out

                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> 1557<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">
                                <ref target="#d4">Document 4</ref>.</note> and has asked me to send
                            the following reply. He is most desirous of receiving your personal
                            views on this operation at this stage and as it may develop later. You
                            should not be inhibited by concern over what the Washington view may be;
                            we need your on-the-spot impressions of the best course of action.</p>
                        <p>Your recent message raises certain questions on which we should like
                            amplification:</p>
                        <p>a. In saying “the die is cast” do you mean that it is too late to turn
                            back from supporting the Generals? Later in the cable you appear to
                            favor going direct to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> prior
                            to encouraging the coup.</p>
                        <p>b. You state that there is insufficient reason for “a crash approval on
                            our part.” Does this mean that we can delay a decision for a matter of
                            days, for example. What are the risks of leaks, apprehension of leaders
                            by <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> or of premature coup
                            action?</p>
                        <p>c. You state that “if we continue the pressure on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>”, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> may be levered into provocative action. What forms
                            of pressure do you have in mind?</p>
                        <p>d. What role can you play in influencing the senior military authorities?
                            At some time in the near future should you not talk to <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> and perhaps some of the
                            other Generals and assess the quality of their plans? We do not want to
                            become involved in any coup which will not succeed.</p>
                        <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0041"/>
                        <p>These are some of the points on which you can help us. The President
                            wants you to know that he reposes great confidence in you and wants your
                            uninhibited advice. Next meeting with President will be 1200 EDT August
                            29. He would like to hear from you by that time.</p>
                        <p>In closing, let me say that while this operation got off to a rather
                            uncoordinated start, it is now squarely on the track and all Washington
                            agencies are participating fully in its support.</p>

                            operation starts it must succeed. But it remains unclear to us that
                            balance of forces in Saigon yet gives necessary high confidence of
                            success, and we need daily assessment from you on this critical point.
                            In particular, we share your view that <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName>'s position and views are important and we await
                            report of his conversation.</p>
                        <p>2. More broadly, we are assuming that whatever cover you and we maintain,
                            prestige of U.S. will necessarily be engaged in success or failure of
                            this effort. Thus we ask for your present estimate of latest point at
                            which operation could be suspended and what would be consequences of
                            such suspension. We continue to believe Nhus must go and coup will be
                            needed, but we do not which [wish] to bind you <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0042"/>against your better judgment at any stage. Conversely,
                            while we assume Generals' operation still subject to delay or
                            cancellation, if you believe die is cast, we need to know it.</p>
                        <p>3. In addition to recommendation in your 364, which we are still
                            considering, what other actions do you recommend to increase prospects
                            of success? Specifically, do you think we should </p>
                        <p>(a) add discreet diplomatic and military endorsement to approach made by
                                <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> to Generals, especially to
                            emphasize official view of the USG that Nhus should be replaced, but
                            without direct comment on coup planning?</p>
                        <p>(b) through General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and
                            other military officers discreetly hint to General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>, Colonel Vien and other military
                            leaders who are potential fence-sitters that US opposed to continuation
                            of Nhus?</p>
                        <p>(c) add financial inducements as appropriate in affecting all individual
                            decisions of uncertain key figures?</p>
                        <p>(d) undertake and discreetly publicize movements of US forces in Pacific
                            toward South Vietnam, in addition to present E and E contingency
                            deployments?</p>
                        <p>(e) indicate our concern by beginning evacuation of appropriate US
                            dependent personnel?</p>
                        <p>4. We have concurred until now in your belief that nothing should be said
                            to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, but changing
                            circumstances, including his probable knowledge that something is afoot,
                            lead us to ask again if you see value in one last man-to-man effort to
                            persuade him to govern himself and decisively to eliminate political
                            influence of Nhus. All evidence indicates to us that removal of Nhus is
                            center of problem.</p>
                        <p>5. We understand that what we have told Generals is that they will have
                            to proceed at their own risk and will not be bailed out by us. While
                            this is sound initial approach, we must surely be ready to play every
                            effective card at decisive moments. Therefore request your report of
                            additional actions you and <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> expect to take or recommend after coup begins to
                            insure its success.</p>
                        <p>6. We shall be meeting tomorrow here at noon, our time, with President,
                            and count on having your report by then to keep Washington in fullest

                        <p>371. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> from Kattenburg. Had
                            three hour conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> afternoon August 28. More than on earlier occasions
                            (1955, 1958) he talked largely to himself. While there no doubt he is in
                            full possession his faculties, impression of growing neurosis cannot be
                            escaped. Was as if words themselves had magic which made them believable
                            as they came out and he then echoed and re-echoed them further. In
                            moment real emotion, toward end of conversation he said “I'm ready to
                            die, at once, if sweat and blood of last nine years now to be sacrificed
                            to small group of agitators in Buddhist disguise, whom population any
                            case despises.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> made vigorous and
                            impassioned defense his policies since May 8 Hue incident, described
                            communist infiltration Buddhist clergy in minute detail (mumbling
                            largely irrelevant and very hard to follow examples, none of which when
                            further reflected upon constitute any real hard evidence—though I asked
                            him provide same and he said he would “when inquiry is complete”).</p>
                        <p>He also passionately defended brothers <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_THUC1">Thuc</persName>,
                            stating it was “criminal” that U.S. press would attack a man of such
                            total integrity and holy devotion as <persName corresp="#p_THUC1">Thuc</persName>. Described brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> as pure intellectual, a philosopher who never raised
                            voice in debate, never sought favor for himself, said “wish Americans
                            could provide me with another like him.” As for Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, he had said things to her but she
                            had been mighty provoked by U.S. press. Republican Youth of both sexes,
                            main achievement of Nhus, had been perhaps greatest benefit brought to
                            country since 1954, symbolized new, vital and democratic generation
                            brought out of vacuum in which country plunged when he took over.
                            Brother Luyen had seen rightly reasons for government policies, was
                            explaining them effectively in London, and contrasted with perfidy of
                            Chuong who had never forgiven fact some his ricelands taken in land
                            reform.</p>
                        <p>Do Van Ly, who had been with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            in U.S. (as I would remember) was philosopher and capable publicist.
                            Prince <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName> had left Saigon and
                            would represent Viet-Nam in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if debate
                            took place. (<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> did not
                            specify when he would arrive New York.) <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu
                                Hoi</persName> had been ill at first when seeing condition to which
                            bonzes had brought his <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0045"/>mother,
                            but had recovered and realized insane atmosphere which leading younger
                            bonzes (“les meneurs”) were creating in pagodas and Buddhist
                            community.</p>
                        <p>Viet-Nam was still much too underdeveloped to be properly understood by
                            most Westerners. Bonzes had from beginning played on traditional
                            primitive proclivities in people for irrational acts, had consciously
                            developed wild atmosphere of raving and noise. All this carefully
                            stirred up by extremely clever Viet Cong cadres. Latter were still at it
                            and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> knew who some of them were and
                            were following them in present wanderings in pagodas all across <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said Buddhist issue now
                            entirely solved. He had met morning August 28 with members Vietnamese
                            Sangka, real representatives Vietnamese Buddhist clergy which shunted
                            aside by agitators like 24-year old Nghiep who dignified in U.S. press
                            as “venerable.” Meeting had brought complete solution all points at
                            issue and mutual respect both sides. Now that country rid of agitators,
                            it could go back to winning war and principal task building democracy
                            through Strategic Hamlet Program.</p>
                        <p>Action night of August 20 had been unanimously requested by Generals on
                            19th and 20th and he had agreed, after careful personal study, that
                            government could no longer tolerate impossible situation created by
                            Communist controlled agitators. How could American press and even
                            official broadcasts accuse Colonel <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> (“not a great warrior, but a good man in special
                            operations against <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>”) of being
                            responsible for action which all Generals his armed forces had pressed
                            on him out of patriotic sense of duty and devotion to country.</p>
                        <p>But U.S. press was in any case most irresponsible and creating terribly
                            dangerous misunderstandings. Constant misstatement of fact in U.S. press
                            must be corrected, and he asked me do all I possibly could to help in
                            this, “for sake all our years of work” and all that had been built up,
                            and in midst terrible war against cruel and implacable enemy. He
                            realized latter would stop at nothing, not even at organizing attacks in
                            U.S. against his government. But at least “technical cadres” among
                            American services here who were organizing U.S. press corps against him
                            should stop their insane activities. He made this last plea in strong
                            and impassioned language.</p>
                        <p>I was unable to break in more than once or twice, but did manage convey
                            to him, I think (speaking frankly as friend, having known him 10 years),
                            that his image abroad, and I thought in Viet-Nam too, had deteriorated
                            considerably. I asked whether he intended convoke National Assembly
                            explain government actions and whether and when he would hold new
                            elections. He responded he was studying possibility <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0046"/>meeting Assembly, failed to respond to
                            question on elections. When I was finally able break monologue and
                            leave, he said with great sincerity “try help us.” I said “please try to
                            do same for us.” </p>

                        <p>1. We are launched on a course from which there is no respectable fuming
                            back: The overthrow of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            government. There is no turning back in part because U.S. prestige is
                            already publicly committed to this end in large measure and will become
                            more so as facts leak out. In a more fundamental sense, there is no
                            turning back because there is no possibility, in my view, that the war
                            can be won under a <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            administration, still less that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> or any member of the family can govern the country
                            in a way to gain the support of the people who count, i.e., the educated
                            class in and out of government service, civil and military—not to
                            mention the American people. In the last few months (and especially
                            days), they have in fact positively alienated these people to an
                            incalculable degree. So that I am personally in full agreement with the
                            policy which I was instructed to carry out by last Sunday's

                        </p>
                        <p>2. The chance of bringing off a Generals' coup depends on them to some
                            extent; but it depends at least as much on us.</p>
                        <p>3. We should proceed to make all-out effort to get Generals to move
                            promptly. To do so we should have authority to do following:</p>
                        <p>(a) That General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> repeat
                            to Generals personally messages previously transmitted by <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> officers. This should establish their
                            authenticity. (General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            should have order from President on this.)</p>
                        <p>(b) If nevertheless Generals insist on public statement that all U.S. aid
                            to Vietnam through <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime
                            has been stopped, we would agree, on express understanding that Generals
                            will have started at same time. (We would seek persuade Generals that it
                            would be better to hold this card for use in event of stalemate. We hope
                            it will not be necessary to do this at all.)</p>
                        <p>4. Vietnamese Generals doubt that we have the will power, courage, and
                            determination to see this thing through. They are haunted by the idea
                            that we will run out on them even though we have told them pursuant to
                            instructions, that the game had started.</p>
                        <p>5. We must press on for many reasons. Some of these are:</p>
                        <p>(a) Explosiveness of the present situation which may well lead to riots
                            and violence if issue of discontent with regime is not met. Out of this
                            could come a pro-Communist or at best a neutralist set of
                            politicians.</p>
                        <p>(b) The fact that war cannot be won with the present regime.</p>
                        <p>(c) Our own reputation for steadfastness and our unwillingness to
                            stultify ourselves.</p>
                        <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0048"/>
                        <p>(d) If proposed action is suspended, I believe a body blow will be dealt
                            to respect for us by Vietnamese Generals. Also, all those who expect
                            U.S. to straighten out this situation will feel let down. Our help to
                            the regime in past years inescapably gives us a large responsibility
                            which we cannot avoid.</p>
                        <p>6. I realize that this course involves a very substantial risk of losing
                            Vietnam. It also involves some additional risk to American lives. I
                            would never propose it if I felt there was a reasonable chance of
                            holding Vietnam with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>7. In response to specific question (c) in <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 268,<note n="3" xml:id="d12fn3">
                                <ref target="#d8">Document 8</ref>.</note> I would not hesitate to
                            use financial inducements if I saw a useful opportunity.</p>
                        <p>As to (d) I favor such moves, provided it is made clear they are not
                            connected with evacuation Americans. As for (e); I fear evacuation of
                            U.S. personnel now would alarm the Generals and demoralize the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>8. In response to your para 4, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> thinks that I should ask <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to get rid of the Nhus before
                            starting the Generals' action. But I believe that such a step has no
                            chance of getting the desired result and would have the very serious
                            effect of being regarded by the Generals as a sign of American
                            indecision and delay. I believe this is a risk which we should not run.
                            The Generals distrust us too much already. Another point is that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would certainly ask for
                            time to consider such a far-reaching request. This would give the ball
                            to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>9. With the exception of paragraph 8 above General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> concurs in this telegram.</p>

                                <ref target="#d4">Document 4</ref>.</note> follows:</p>
                        <p>A. By reference to die being cast I meant that Generals have received
                            assurance of U.S. support in their projected task of removal of Nhus
                            from position of influence. Should we withhold such support U.S./<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> relations would be estranged
                            indefinitely and future effectiveness of support programs in Vietnam
                            would be zero. Withholding previously proffered support would constitute
                            breach of faith and would undoubtedly result in failure of Vietnamese to
                            ever again be able to place credence in official U.S. statements or
                            commitments. Amplification my views with regard going direct to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> prior to encouraging
                            the coup contained in para C below.</p>
                        <p>B. Generals will not move without U.S. support and until detailed
                            practical plans are drawn, and forces aligned. The status of plans, if
                            any, at the moment are extremely well guarded secrets from U.S. military
                            authority. They are likely to remain so. There are so many rumors flying
                            around that piecemeal leaks may well be inconsequential. Plotters have
                            kept their number to an absolute minimum, apparently. A problem facing
                            the Generals and arguing against precipitate action on their part is I
                            believe their genuine patriotic desire to accomplish their ends with
                            absolute minimum of bloodshed and damage. If Generals can line up
                            overwhelming strength to guarantee quick relatively painless decision, I
                            believe they will do so at the cost of a few days time. In meantime
                            believe only danger of rash or premature acts lies with pro <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> forces if they see intolerable
                            balance of power lining up against them. Such rash action seems unlikely
                            yet. The security of key Generals is good, except for <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> who is not physically
                            located at <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss>. Believe that as long as
                                <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> moves about
                            openly, the <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> forces do not
                            dare eliminate him. In the meantime opportunity is open to persuade
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to remove Nhus.</p>
                        <p>C. In my view, we can and should bring further pressure on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> concurrent with continued
                            negotiations with Generals. The two approaches are not incompatible
                            provided we inform the Generals in advance of our ultimatums, being
                            presented <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. I believe that
                            Ambassador should immediately make firm effort, repeated as necessary,
                                <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0050"/>to convince <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to send Nhus abroad, as private
                            citizens, as condition for continued U.S. support of his regime. <gloss target="#t_AMB1">Amb</gloss> could reinforce demarche with world
                            condemnation of Vietnam over Buddhist reprisals which all believe
                            engineered by Nhus. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> may
                            well refuse but his refusal of this direct ultimatum, often considered
                            but never before advanced, will certainly stiffen our resolve to back
                            the Generals as the only remaining course of action. Moreover, should
                            this approach, and the possibility that Diem may accept, force <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to attempt his own coup, the
                            position of the Generals coup group will be strengthened militarily and
                            psychologically in any counter-coup action.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador does not concur in this approach. My thought is we should do
                            everything possible and leave no course of action untried in our efforts
                            to solve the present dilemma without bloodshed.</p>
                        <p>As to what role can I play I might try assist <gloss target="#t_AMB1">Amb</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> in placing pressure on
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> by indicating how
                            present state of affairs so detrimental to war effort which has been
                            going so well. Attempt at this time on my part to see <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> would I believe only put
                            the finger on him. You will note from <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> [<hi rend="italic">document number not

                                declassified</hi>] also indicated Generals are quite coy as regards
                            any details of their plans. Such position on their part I believe is
                            understandable at this time. Up to now I have not discussed any plan of
                            action with Generals. In fact I have no authority to do so. However I am
                            ready to do so if directed, and if it is determined <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> has gone as far as it can go-and
                            Generals now need more concrete assurance of U.S. backing. As I see most
                            of the Generals quite frequently, approach can be done in course of
                            normal meetings. I agree we do not want to back any plan that does not
                            augur for success.</p>
                        <p>In summation it is my opinion that not only are we unalterably committed
                            to support actions of Generals to relieve Vietnam from the <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> influences but that also such
                            course of action is in the best interests of our country.</p>
                        <p>Skillful execution on part of all concerned could lead to successful
                            accomplishment of task with little or no bloodshed. We must accept fact
                            that less skillful execution while still accomplishing over-all aim
                            could well result in more intense actions with resultant severe
                            consequences. However on balance feel that competence of those involved
                            and their determination to rid their country of festering sore will
                            insure success.</p>

                            <item>Viet-Nam: Reporting of Tad Szulc, New York Times<note n="2" xml:id="d14fn2">Apparent reference to a New York Times article
                                    entitled, “Long Crisis Seen on Vietnam Rule,” August 28, in
                                    which Szulc reported that some officials in Washington believed
                                    the only solution for the Vietnam crisis was to remove <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, or <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> if the two brothers were
                                    inseparable, by a military coup. These unnamed officials were,
                                    according to Szulc, not sure that such a plan was
                                    feasible.</note>

                        <p>The President said he thought Tad Szulc seemed to be getting pretty close
                            to things. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said the
                            whole point here is the mere fact that for the benefit of the military
                            out there we had to do something to get the blame off them and that, of
                            course, is bound to give smart pressmen grounds for speculation. He
                            called attention to the latter part of the article and said that it left
                            the impression that we are trying to give that things are simmering,
                            that the situation must be allowed to mature. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> assured the President that the
                            situation was being watched very closely.</p>
                        <p>The President said, “We are not making any more press comments, are we?”
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said inevitably there
                            have to be statements on events. For example, when the Vietnamese
                            Government says we were wrong when we protested the beating up of the
                            pagodas then we had to reply that we stand by our statement of the other
                            day. Nothing beyond that.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>
                            thought anyone was talking to Szulc. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said he did not think anyone was. The people
                            here are under strict instructions. He said the President would notice
                                <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0052"/>the article was based on
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> statements and USG
                            statements-the only things attributed to the US Government are past hard
                            statements. The rest are Szulc's deductions.</p>
                        <p>The President said, “O.K., Roger, fine.”</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reported that both
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> agreed that the war
                            against the Viet Cong in Vietnam cannot be won under the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime. <note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">See <ref target="#d11">Documents 11</ref>,<ref target="#d12">12</ref>, and <ref target="#d13">13</ref>.</note>
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> wants to try to
                            separate the Nhus from <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. He
                            believes our target is more <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            than <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. The question for
                            decision is whether to instruct General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to back up the approaches made to the Vietnamese
                            generals by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> agents. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> has already told one
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> official, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName>, to tell the Vietnamese
                            generals that the U.S. Ambassador is behind the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> approach. Although indicating our support of a coup, we
                            should avoid getting committed to the details of the generals' coup
                            planning.</p>

                                discussion at this meeting both recount that <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> recommended, to use
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>'s phrase, “one
                                last try with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.”
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName>'s version also
                                adds that <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> thought
                                that “the likelihood of separating the two [<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>] is slight.” <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> also include an
                                observation by <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> that
                                the conversation between <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Kattenburg</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> (see <ref target="#d10">Document 10</ref>)
                                indicated that it would be fruitless to try to split <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> from <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</note> said the first
                            question the coup generals would ask was whether they could use the U.S.
                            helicopters now operating with the Vietnamese army.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether anyone had any reservations about the course
                            of action we were following.<note n="4" xml:id="d15fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> includes in his
                                record the following exchange among the President and his advisers
                                at approximately this point in the discussion: “The Secretary said
                                that although we had a need to know the adequacy of the plan, we
                                should not get directly into planning. “Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> asked if the Secretary was
                                making a distinction between participating in coup planning and
                                further reassurances to the Generals. The Secretary said that this
                                was precisely the distinction he was making. “Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> intervened and asked if we
                                intended to get so deep into engineering a coup against <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> as to, for example, use
                                American helicopters to transport the forces of the coup Generals to
                                Saigon. “The President said that he wanted to get back to the basic
                                question. In the light of the cables from <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, was there anyone in the
                                EXCOM who wished to withdraw from the operation? And, secondly, what
                                was the feeling of the EXCOM about the issue of an approach to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>?”</note> The issue
                            was whether we should continue as we are now doing or withdraw from the
                            present effort.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> recommended
                            that we disassociate ourselves from efforts to bring about a coup, but
                            he did favor an attempt by General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to get <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to fire <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.
                            He believed that this effort should be undertaken sometime later, i.e.
                            two or three days later, when the coup capability of the Vietnamese
                            generals is greater. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> agreed with this view, adding that we should
                            confront <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> with an ultimatum
                            expiring within a few hours so that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> could not take counteraction against the generals
                            in the period before they were ready to act.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he sees
                            no valid alternative to the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            regime. Vice President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> is
                            apparently not the man to replace <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. A military junta of the Vietnamese generals now
                            planning a coup is not capable of running the Vietnamese government for
                            very long. Therefore, a last effort should be made to persuade <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to change his government by
                            dismissing <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's question as to who is running the
                            government now, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> replied that President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was in control and continuing to
                            work his usual eighteen hours a day. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> relies on <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> for ideas. His executive officer is <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> who is opposed to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> but loyal to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> would remain with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> if <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> were
                            dismissed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> pointed out that we
                            were dealing with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> who, if a
                            coup were successful, would lose power and possibly his life. Therefore,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had nothing to lose and
                            we must recognize this fact in dealing with him. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> might call on the North Vietnamese
                            to help him throw out the Americans. The U.S. should not go to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> with a request that he fire
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> but that the Vietnamese
                            generals, as a prelude to a coup, demand of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that he dismiss <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0054"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he favors
                            trying to save <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, but
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> appears not to
                            support such an attempt.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that the first
                            phase is to remove <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and Madame
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> from power. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> appears to believe
                            that there is no hope of separating <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> pointed out that
                            problems of public opinion would be simpler if the Vietnamese generals
                            are in the posture of remaining loyal to a <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> who had dismissed the Nhus. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> pointed out the great difficulty of
                            attempting a coup which resulted in <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> remaining as head of the government. He foresaw
                            great difficulty in trying to save <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> as the figurehead of a new government.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> suggested that
                            we inform both <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and the
                            Vietnamese generals that there would be no U.S. economic or political
                            support until the changes we demanded were made. He asked that we talk
                            to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> directly. He predicted
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would not be surprised
                            to be told by us that the Vietnamese generals also want a change in the
                            government.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that if <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> says no to a change in government there would be no
                            way in which we could withdraw our demand.<note n="5" xml:id="d15fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>'s record has the
                                President asking at this point: “whether we would really pull out of
                                Vietnam in any event.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> urged that before
                            any ultimatum was given to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            we have a coup plan in our hip pocket. He cautioned against the U.S.
                            getting involved in the coup planning in such a way as to prematurely
                            commit us to an uncertain coup to be carried out by people we were
                            uncertain about.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> acknowledged that we
                            should not get into detailed planning of a coup, but we did have a need
                            to know whether the generals were counting on our support.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> urged that any
                            coup plan be given to General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> who could say whether or not in his opinion it
                            was militarily feasible.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that an announcement that we were cutting off
                            U.S. aid was a bad signal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> responded that we need a U.S. signal which could
                            be given by General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and
                            other U.S. military officers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said that General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> could be instructed to tell
                            the generals that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> channel is
                            spelling out official U.S. policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> added that reassurance by U.S. military officers
                            to certain Vietnamese generals might persuade those generals on the
                            fence to come over in support of a coup.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> recommended
                            that for the time being we do not give Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> authority to say, at a time of
                            his choosing, that U.S. aid to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is stopping. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that we could wait until the generals form a
                            government and then announce that we are transferring to them U.S.
                            aid.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested that
                            we do not announce we are cutting aid, but wait until the generals have
                            taken over the government, we recognized the new government, and then
                            say publicly that our aid would be continued to the new government. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> commented that prompt recognition of a
                            new government and an announcement that we were continuing U.S. aid to
                            them would convince everyone that we had been in cahoots with the
                            Vietnamese generals.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we could announce we were suspending our aid
                            because of the unstable conditions in Vietnam. However, this was a later
                            action and we should decide now on the actions to be taken
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed that we
                            should instruct General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            to back up the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and get information
                            about coup planning. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked that we avoid making any commitment to the
                            generals until they had produced a coup plan acceptable to us.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that the Vietnamese generals would obviously try
                            to get us more and more involved, recalling a comment made by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>—what was our
                            position if we were asked whether U.S. forces were available to support
                            the Vietnamese generals? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said our objective was merely to reassure the
                            generals of our support. These generals want to have a bloodless coup
                            and will not need to use U.S. equipment with the exception of possibly
                            U.S. helicopters.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested we
                            learn as much as we can about the coup plans without talking about the
                            use of U.S. forces. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> added that the coup
                            was their show and that we should stick with our plan, which was to
                            support the Vietnamese effort.</p>
                        <p>The President raised the problem of evacuating U.S. nationals and asked
                            whether our capability was sufficient. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> summarized parts of the
                            evacuation plan, calling attention to the forces which can be brought to
                            Saigon within ten hours. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said it was hard to describe the evacuation force
                            as sufficient to the need, but the military is moving additional U.S.
                            forces into areas closer to Vietnam so that they would have a capability
                            of expanding the number of people who could be quickly evacuated.</p>
                        <p>The President summarized the agreed actions to be taken:</p>
                        <p>1. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> is to be
                            instructed to back up the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> approaches
                            to the Vietnamese generals.</p>
                        <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0056"/>
                        <p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> is to be
                            authorized to announce the suspension of U.S. aid. We have to give him
                            this authority, but we should control the timing of this
                            announcement.</p>
                        <p>3. No announcement is to be made of the movement of U.S. forces to the
                            area. This information will leak out in any event. We do not want the
                            Vietnamese to conclude that we are getting in a position to intervene in
                            Vietnam with U.S. fighting forces.</p>
                        <p>4. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> is to have
                            authority over all overt and covert operations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Helms</persName> suggested that certain
                            planned covert actions which would lead to a considerable amount of
                            confusion in Vietnam would be taken only when all plans for the coup
                            were ready. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that
                            a group was at work listing covert actions to be taken in the event of a
                            military coup. The President asked that this list<note n="6" xml:id="d15fn6">Not found.</note> be made available to him this
                            afternoon.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> called attention to
                            the high risk which is involved in the course of action we were taking.
                            He warned that shooting of and by Americans would almost certainly be
                            involved. Before any action is over he said that American troops would
                            be firing their weapons and American citizens might be killed.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what approach was to be made to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> responded that in the cable to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> we would raise
                            the question of who should talk to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and when, but we would not instruct him in the next
                            day or two to tell <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> must go.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what we would tell <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. Must we tell him that he must choose among firing
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> or having us cease our
                            aid or being faced with a military coup. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> responded by pointing out that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> so far had had
                            no substantive talk with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.
                            He urged that we instruct Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> to have a cards-down talk with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> now. This talk would take place
                            before we discussed a coup with the Vietnamese generals. If we proceed
                            in this fashion, we would have nothing to hide. He said we should tell
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that we want a new deal
                            and that our commitments have been altered by recent events in Vietnam.
                            If we lay it on the line with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, telling him that we can't continue our aid unless
                            he changes, we, by so doing, would have the best chance of getting a
                            stable base on which we could continue the war against the Viet
                            Cong.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> urged that we not tell Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> to do something he
                            does not want to do. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> pointed out that if Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> takes this line with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, telling him he must change or
                            else, the effect will be to stimulate <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to immediate action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> hasn't yet said anything to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0057"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> recommended
                            that both Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> see <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and tell them how they have alienated the Vietnamese
                            people and the Vietnamese military officers. The resulting situation is
                            one which we cannot accept. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> disagreed with this suggestion and predicted that
                            the sole result would be to trigger action by <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. We should not proceed along this
                            line until the generals are ready to launch a coup.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that if <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> rejects our demands, there is the possibility that
                            the generals' planning would be upset and Nhu would act against
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said it was
                            not clear whether the generals want to get rid of both <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. He said that he believed the generals wanted to
                            get rid of both Nhus and believed that we could live with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and a new government. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> noted that we have
                            already told the generals that they can keep <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in their new government if they
                            wished. This is a decision which is up to them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said he had heard from Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, who is not in Washington. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> says he favors
                            another attempt to persuade <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            to leave. He even suggested that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName>, who knows <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, make this attempt. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> wants to be certain that a coup can be brought
                            off before we commit ourselves to supporting the generals' attempt.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> repeated this view
                            that our main target is the Nhus.</p>
                        <p>A smaller group met with the President in his office. The cables of
                            instruction were agreed upon.<note n="7" xml:id="d15fn7">

                            the USG supports the movement to eliminate the Nhus from the government,
                            but that before arriving at specific understandings with the Generals,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> must know who
                            are involved, resources available to them and overall plan for coup. The
                            USG will support a coup which has good chance of succeeding but plans no
                            direct involvement of U.S. Armed Forces. <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> should state that he is prepared to establish
                            liaison with the coup planners to review plans, but will not engage
                            directly in joint coup planning.<note n="3" xml:id="d16fn3">In telegram

                                noted that the Mission had no further contact with the Generals.

                            We cannot of course prevent unauthorized disclosures or speculation, but
                            we will in any event knock down any reports of evacuation.</p>

                            authority, you should consider importance of timing and managing
                            announcement so as to minimize appearance of collusion with Generals,
                            and also to minimize danger of <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0059"/>unpredictable and disruptive reaction by existing government. We also
                            assume that you will not in fact use this authority unless you think it
                            essential, and we see it as possible that <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' approach and increasing process of cooperation
                            may provide assurance Generals desire. Our own view is that it will be
                            best to hold this authority for use in close conjunction with coup, and
                            not for present encouragement of Generals, but decision is yours.</p>

                        <p>279. Eyes only for the Ambassador from the Secretary. Deeply appreciate
                            your 375<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2">
                                <ref target="#d12">Document 12</ref>.</note> which was a most
                            helpful clarification. We fully understand enormous stakes at issue and
                            the heavy responsibilities which you and <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> will be carrying in the days ahead and we want
                            to do everything possible from our end to help.</p>
                        <p>Purpose of this message is to explore further question of possible
                            attempt to separate <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and the
                            Nhus. In your telegram you appear to treat <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and the Nhus as a single package whereas we had
                            indicated earlier to the Generals that if the Nhus were removed the
                            question of retaining <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would
                            be up to them. My own personal assessment is (and this is not an
                            instruction) that the Nhus are by all odds the greater part of the
                            problem in Viet-Nam, internally, internationally and for American public
                            opinion. Perhaps it is inconceivable that the Nhus could be removed
                            without taking <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> with them or
                            without <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s abandoning his
                            post. In any event, I would appreciate your comment on whether any
                            distinction can or should be drawn as between <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and Counselor and Madame
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The only point on which you and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> have different views is whether an attempt
                            should be made with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to
                            eliminate the Nhus and presumably take other steps to consolidate the
                            country behind a winning effort against the Viet Cong. My own hunch,
                            based <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0060"/>in part on the report of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Kattenburg</persName>'s conversations
                            with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">See <ref target="#d10">Document
                                10</ref>.</note> is that such an approach could not succeed if it
                            were cast purely in terms of persuasion. Unless such a talk included a
                            real sanction, such as a threatened withdrawal of our support, it is
                            unlikely that it would be taken completely seriously by a man who may
                            feel that we are inescapably committed to an anti-communist Viet-Nam.
                            But if a sanction were used in such a conversation, there would be a
                            high risk that this would be taken by <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> as a sign that action against him and the Nhus was
                            imminent and he might as a minimum move against the Generals or even
                            take some quite fantastic action such as calling on North Viet-Nam for
                            assistance in expelling the Americans.</p>
                        <p>It occurs to me, therefore, that if such an approach were to be made it
                            might properly await the time when others were ready to move immediately
                            to constitute a new government. If this be so, the question then arises
                            as to whether an approach to insist upon the expulsion of the Nhus
                            should come from Americans rather than from the Generals themselves.
                            This might be the means by which the Generals could indicate that they
                            were prepared to distinguish between <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and the Nhus. In any event, were the Generals to
                            take this action it would tend to protect succeeding Viet-Nam
                            administrations from the charge of being wholly American puppets
                            subjected to whatever anti-American sentiment is inherent in so complex
                            a situation.</p>
                        <p>I would be glad to have your further thoughts on these points as well as
                            your views on whether further talks with Diem are contemplated to
                            continue your opening discussions with him. You will have received
                            formal instructions on other matters through other messages. Good
                            luck.</p>

                                is that these messages are not in the normal series and their
                                existence is not known except to the President and to the Secretary
                                of State, so I do not want them in a message file that may be seen
                                by others who believe themselves privy to the most classified
                                material. You should tell the President, however, that I discussed
                                the outgoing message in draft with the Secretaries of State and
                                Defense who concurred in it. The Secretary of Defense in particular
                                thought it was a wise and necessary cable. “You may wish to ask the
                                President after he has read the messages whether he wants to send
                                any further message to the Ambassador on this topic. My own advice
                                is not to do so at this time, but to be ready to call his attention
                                to this question again if the developing situation makes it
                                advisable. “I am sorry to be so cryptic.” The other message included
                                in the envelope for the President was <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s reply; see <ref target="#d18fn2">footnote

                        <p>I have approved all the messages you are receiving from others today, and
                            I emphasize that everything in these messages has my full support.</p>
                        <p>We will do all that we can to help you conclude this operation
                            successfully. Nevertheless, there is one point on my own constitutional
                            responsibilities as President and Commander in Chief which I wish to
                            state to you in this entirely private message, which is not being
                            circulated here beyond the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>Until the very moment of the go signal for the operation by the Generals,
                            I must reserve a contingent right to change course and reverse previous
                            instructions. While fully aware of your assessment of the consequences
                            of such a reversal, I know from experience that failure is more
                            destructive than an appearance of indecision. I would, of course, accept
                            full responsibility for any such change as I must bear also the full
                            responsibility for this operation and its consequences. It is for this
                            reason that I count on you for a continuing assessment of the prospects
                            of success and most particularly desire your candid warning if current
                            course begins to go sour. When we go, we must go to win, but it will be
                            better to change our minds than fail. And if our national interest
                            should require a change of mind, we must not be afraid of it.</p>

                                August 30, noon, as follows: “1. I fully understand that you have

                            informed <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> that he had a report from a
                            source of medium reliability to the effect that within 24 hours the govt
                            would begin the arrest of Generals who might not be fully loyal. The
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] rep
                            intimated that this was the same source who on 20 Aug had provided
                            report forecasting govt attack on the pagodas.</p>
                        <p>2. It was decided to attempt alert the Generals to this information while
                            cautioning them that info was not confirmed and could be speculative. Of
                            the various means available to pass this in best was thought to be
                            contact with Major Nhieu who is next-door neighbor of Colonel Ralph E.
                            Newman, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. Major Nhieu is the Administrative Assistant of
                            General Duong Van Minh. Newman, Nhieu and General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> have a close relationship
                            resulting from fact Colonel Newman was General <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName>'s advisor for approx 7
                            months.</p>
                        <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0063"/>
                        <p>3. Col Newman was contacted by a <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            officer. Col Newman immediately attempted contact with Major Nhieu but
                            was unable to telephone him or to find anyone at home at Major Nhieu's
                            residence. Col Newman volunteered that he was also on good terms with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_LVKBG1">Le Van Kim</persName> and could
                            probably pass message to General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. Newman was requested to call General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> and state he had been approached by Vietnamese
                            friend who was extremely worried about his son who had been arrested on
                            Sunday during roundup of students and that Newman very much wanted talk
                            with General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> with respect to
                            securing release of arrested boy.</p>
                        <p>5. Colonel Newman placed call to General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>'s residence and noted immediately that telephone
                            line was being monitored. An individual attempting to imitate General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>'s voice came onto the
                            line and repeatedly requested Colonel Newman's location. Col Newman then
                            asked to speak to Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>. A
                            woman then came on line and Colonel Newman recognized her voice as that
                            of Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>. Col Newman passed
                            message concerning fictitious arrested student and asked come to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>'s house. The line was
                            then broken. Very soon thereafter, General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>'s aide came to Col Newman's house and escorted Col
                            Newman and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> officer to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>'s house. The message was
                            passed to General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> who was
                            most appreciative of the warning. General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> promised to get the message to General <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> immediately. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> did state that it was
                            very dangerous for Col Newman to come to his house and that for the time
                            being these contacts should be suspended. Col Newman noted the presence
                            of approx one platoon of troops in the vicinity of General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>'s house. Upon departure from
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>'s house Newman and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> officer were escorted away from the
                            house over a back road and through gates apparently very seldom
                            used.</p>
                        <p>6. There are at least two among other hazards in the present situation at
                            the Generals' end of this operation. The first is that the arrest of
                            four or five key figures among the Generals might bring this operation
                            to a halt at least for the short run. This action seems easily within
                            capability of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. It is puzzling that
                            action of this nature has not already been taken. We can only be
                            speculative on this subject. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> may be
                            attempting to avoid direct confrontation in hope that steam will
                            gradually go out of Generals' present course. It may worry about causing
                            further disaffection throughout Armed Forces or revolt in corps areas.
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could be waiting for premature
                            coup to crush military opposition. Or it may be building up its dossiers
                            on course of coup plotting to present to armed forces and general public
                            after arrest of key Generals in effort diminish impact these arrests.
                            Another hazard is that one or another of Generals involved might betray
                            details of operation. So far we cannot point fingers at anyone. Hope HQS
                            will <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0064"/>understand that speculation
                            on possible negative factors does not represent negative station
                            attitude. We are bringing all capabilities we can think of to bear.</p>

                        <p>1. I agree that getting the Nhus out is the prime objective and that they
                            are “the greater part of the problem in Vietnam, internally,
                            internationally and for American public opinion.”</p>
                        <p>2. This surely cannot be done by working through <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. In fact <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will oppose it. He wishes he had
                            more Nhus, not less.</p>
                        <p>3. The best chance of doing it is by the Generals taking over the
                            government lock, stock and barrel.</p>
                        <p>4. After this has been done, it can then be decided whether to put

                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961-1963, vol. III,
                                    Document 281</ref>.</note> is inertia. The days come and go and
                            nothing happens. It is, of course, natural for the Generals to want
                            assurances and the U.S. Government has certainly been prompt in its
                            reactions. But here it is Friday and, while in one way much has been
                            done, there is not yet enough to show for the hours which we have all
                            put in.</p>
                        <p>6. If I call on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to demand
                            the removal of the Nhus, he will surely not agree. But before turning me
                            down, he will pretend to consider it and involve us in prolonged delays.
                            This will make the Generals suspicious of us and add to the inertia.</p>
                        <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0065"/>
                        <p>7. Such a call by me would look to the Nhus like an ultimatum and would
                            result in their taking steps to thwart any operation dealing with
                            them.</p>
                        <p>8. I agree with you that if a sanction were used, it could provoke an
                            even more fantastic reaction. In fact I greatly dislike the idea of
                            cutting off aid in connection with the Generals' operation and, while I
                            thank you for giving me the authority to make an announcement, I hope we
                            will never have to use it.</p>
                        <p>9. It is possible, as you suggested in your penultimate paragraph, for
                            the Generals when, as and if their operation gets rolling to demand the
                            removal of the Nhus before bringing their operation to fruition. But I
                            am afraid that they will get talked out of their operation which will
                            then disintegrate, still leaving the Nhus in office.</p>
                        <p>10. If the Generals' operation does get rolling, I would not want to stop
                            it until they were in full control. They could then get rid of the Nhus
                            and decide whether they wanted to keep <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>11. It is better for them and for us to throw out the Nhus than for us to
                            get involved in it.</p>
                        <p>12. I am sure that the best way to handle this matter is by a truly
                            Vietnamese movement even it if puts me rather in the position of pushing
                            a piece of spaghetti.</p>
                        <p>13. I am contemplating no further talks with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> at this time.</p>

                            feel that other, perhaps more vital factors, should be sacrificed for
                            sake of coordination. Can means other than personal meetings be used to

                        <p>0483. 1. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> officer has been having
                            series of conversations over past several days with Lt. Colonel Pham
                            Ngoc Thao, former Chief of Kien Hoa Province and now nominally an
                            inspector of strategic hamlets stationed at Presidency.</p>
                        <p>2. Col Thao has figured prominently in past reporting on coup plotting,
                            both on part of <persName corresp="#p_TKT1">Tran Kim Tuyen</persName>
                            and Huynh Van Lang. Col Thao has for some months expressed his
                            dissatisfaction with the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            regime quite openly and has even written notes to this effect to <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. On 30 August Col Thao reported to <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            officer that he had attended dinner evening before with Generals
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, and Duong Van Minh. Main
                            points of conversation follow:</p>
                        <p>a. They stated that if someone else takes initiative to mount coup d'etat
                            against <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, they will support it.</p>
                        <p>b. General <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> pointed out
                            that Generals have too much to lose by initiating a coup. By this he
                            apparently meant in Thao's opinion the Generals' houses, positions and
                            material possessions.</p>
                        <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0067"/>
                        <p>c. The Generals stated they would support Vice President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> as temporary interim government.
                            This would represent legality.</p>
                        <p>d. Generals <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> agreed that they would support
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> if both <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> are killed during a coup attempt. They would support
                            Tho only if <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> survived a coup
                            attempt and in preference to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>e. Generals for first time openly indicated their opposition to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. Whereas as recently as one week
                            ago they would perhaps privately indicate their opposition to Nhu, they
                            now state this as a group.</p>
                        <p>f. Generals said that if first step of attempted coup is successful,
                            i.e., the assassination of President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, they would then support the coup openly. Generals
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> promised they would do their
                            best to send units in wrong directions in case they were instructed to
                            take steps to crush coup attempt.</p>
                        <p>g. Colonel Thao told Generals it may be necessary to move military units
                            in Saigon. That is, some units inclined to support the government would
                            be moved away from palace and other units that might support a coup
                            attempt would be brought into position where they could do so. Generals
                            agreed they would do their best to implement this suggestion. They also
                            said they would try to make suggestions to Colonel <persName corresp="#p_LQTC1">Le Quang Tung</persName> to have the latter move
                            some of his units out of the way. Col Thao claimed that some units have
                            already been moved and that this is proceeding well.</p>
                        <p>h. Col Thao claimed that his group now can count on three battalions.
                            They hope to have a total of five battalions. He said that the plan is
                            to use three battalions to hit the palace, keeping two battalions in
                            reserve. This is based on group's belief that they must have enough
                            forces to control the situation for three or four hours. This would give
                            Generals time to proclaim support and come to the assistance of the coup
                            group.</p>
                        <p>i. Thao said that his group hopes to execute a coup within one month and
                            preferably sooner. He said that there are risks involved in hasty action
                            and risks involved in waiting too long. The group is attempting to
                            determine the best timing.</p>
                        <p>j. Thao said that the following individuals would be welcome in a new
                            government: <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Vu Van Mau</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Tran Van Chuong</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TLQ1">Tran Le Quang</persName>, Vu Van Thai, Huynh Van
                            Lang, Nguyen Huu Chau. Thao also said that opposition politicians, for
                            example Dai Viet leaders, would be considered if they agreed with the
                            principles of the group. He said that the group is not now in contact
                            with the Dai Viet Party.</p>
                        <p>k. Thao said that he would wish to become head of military security in a
                            new government.</p>
                        <p>1. Thao stated that he did not know if his group consisted of the “best
                            men” but he was certain that it consisted of the “most determined”.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> comment: We believe Thao is trying
                            to plan and organize toward a coup at some indeterminate time. Will

                            appears unaware that the Generals he was talking with lack the
                            capability of moving troop units around without <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s approval, that is, at this time

                        <p>1. During 30 Aug <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> sought meeting with
                            Gen. <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> who responded
                            through Maj. Nhon that he was “too busy” today. <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> was called to Palace for
                            lengthy conference this morning. Ambassador has requested Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to call on <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> for meeting in <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' office to offer additional
                            bona fides and to question Gen. <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> on specific plans and timing. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' initial attempt to contact
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> met with response
                            that Gen. <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> was in
                            conference. Do not know when Generals <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> will get together. We are suspending further
                            contacts until after results of <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>
                            meeting are known.</p>
                        <p>2. With respect <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Saigon 0445,<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">
                                <ref target="#d19">Document 19</ref>.</note> wish point out that
                            neither Col. Newman nor Col. Strickler have been made aware of initial
                            plans or actions and that Gen. <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>'s warning was friendly one to Col. Newman simply
                            requesting that Newman, who is old friend, not call on Gen. <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> over immediate future.</p>
                        <p>3. Re ref para 2, we have discussed question of SW, radio, cut outs,
                            etc., with Minister Trueheart in absence of Ambassador. We all believe
                            that this kind of communication would not allow enough substantive
                            exchange. For future, we will rely on established liaison between
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> officer since latter has excellent
                            reason for contacting <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>.
                            Will also explore further utilization of Maj. Nhon as cutout. However,
                            if situation progresses to point where Generals will [want?] some
                            tactical advice, Conein might also have to enter into relationship.</p>
                        <p>4. As addendum, we have previously failed to note that <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> officer did turn over to <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>, at latter's request, on 28
                            August complete ordnance list, obtain sketch of Camp Long Thanh showing
                            weapons emplacements. This is cited as another example of assurance re
                            USG intentions since these plans were provided for purpose of attack on
                            Col. <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName>'s training camp in
                            environs of Saig.</p>

                        <p>U.S. Response:</p>

                        <p>(a) We should point out publicly that Viet-Nam cannot be effectively
                            neutralized unless the Communists are removed from control of North
                            Viet-Nam. If a coalition between Diem and the Communists is suggested,
                            we should reply that this would be the avenue to a Communist take-over
                            in view of the relative strength of the two principals in the coalition.
                            Once an anti-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> coup is
                            started in South Viet-Nam, we can point to the obvious refusal of South
                            Viet-Nam to accept a <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-Communist coalition.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> Move</hi>: If hostilities start
                            between the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and a coup group,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> will seek to negotiate in order to
                            play for time (as during the November, 1960, coup attempt) and rally
                            loyal forces to Saigon.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Response: </p>
                        <p>(a) The U.S. must define its objective with crystal clearness. If we try
                            to save <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> by encouraging
                            negotiations between him and a coup group, while a coup is in progress,
                            we shall greatly increase the risk of an unsuccessful outcome of the
                            coup attempt. Our objective should, therefore, clearly be to bring the
                            whole Ngo family under the control of the coup group.</p>
                        <p>(b) We should warn the coup group to press any military advantage it
                            gains to its logical conclusion without stopping to negotiate.</p>

                        <p>(c) We should use all possible means to influence pro-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> generals like Cao to move to the
                            coup side. For example, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> could send a direct message to Cao pointing to
                            the consequences of a continued stand in support of the Ngo family and
                            the advantage of shifting over to the coup group.</p>
                        <p>(d) We should use, or encourage the coup group to use, military measures
                            to prevent any loyal forces outside Saigon from rallying to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s support. For example, we can
                            jam radio communications between <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and these forces and we can encourage interdiction
                            of transportation by blowing up bridges.</p>
                        <p>(e) We should encourage the coup group to capture and remove promptly
                            from Viet-Nam any members of the Ngo family outside Saigon, including
                            Can and <persName corresp="#p_THUC1">Thuc</persName> who are normally in
                            Hue. We should assist in this operation to any extent necessary.</p>

                            weaken because of the bloodbath which may involve U.S. personnel.</p>

                        <p>(a) We should maintain our sangfroid and encourage the coup forces to

                        <p>(b) We should seek to bring officers loyal to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> over to our side by direct

                        <p>(c) We should encourage the coup group to take necessary action to

                        <p>(d) We should make full use of any U.S. equipment available in Viet-Nam

                            This meeting might, therefore, have been their merely listening to him
                            or an attempt by Thao to smoke out the opposition on behalf of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>

                                [Thao] is being looked to to do the coup planning.” <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> recounts that <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Helms</persName> found “the Thao report most

                        <p>The Secretary of State asked the question: “If the Generals do not intend
                            to move and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> return to the August 20 posture,
                            can we live with it?” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Helms</persName>
                            said that he did not know. It depended upon whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would reverse his course. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Helms</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> probably knew Nhu better than
                            anyone else and asked his opinion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would not “reverse” his course;
                            that he might well ease tensions and produce the facade of August 20,
                            but he would most certainly proceed with his “personalist revolution”
                            and his “strategic hamlet society.”</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was undoubtedly a shifty
                            character but that he could assure everyone that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would not really negotiate with
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> and would not
                            move to a unification with North Vietnam; that he was committed to an
                            anti-Communist course. He said that Nhu would undoubtedly pull
                            shenanigans that would be difficult for the US, with Laos and with
                            Cambodia and shenanigans that would, if anything, put the US into a
                            harder confrontation with North Vietnam and with Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that the answer
                            to the Secretary of State's question, in his opinion, depended on the
                            attitude of the Vietnamese people and the prominence of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> in the weeks and months ahead. He
                            felt that, if <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> assumed a
                            prominent role, say, by occupying the new office of Prime Minister, and
                            the action against the pagodas went without retribution, the graph of
                            the future would be a slow but steady deterioration downwards in which
                            apathy in the army, a drifting off of junior officers and
                            noncommissioned officers, possibly student and labor strikes would
                            slowly but surely degrade the war effort. If, on the other hand, Madame
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> went on a long vacation
                            and brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> faded into the
                            background, it was possible that the graph would be slightly upwards
                            from level—i.e., that progress might be made in the war against the Viet
                            Cong but it would be much slower and less certain and take several years
                            longer than the Secretary of Defense and he had contemplated at, say,
                            the last Honolulu meeting.<note n="6" xml:id="d26fn6">Regarding the

                        <p>The Secretary of State then turned to the question of the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> statement <note n="7" xml:id="d26fn7">On August 29, French President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">Charles De Gaulle</persName> made a statement
                                on Vietnam at a meeting of the French Council of Ministers. At the
                                close of the Council meeting, the French Minister of Information,
                                Alain Peyrefitte, read the statement to news correspondents. The
                                statement reads in part as follows: “France's knowledge of the
                                merits of this people makes her appreciate the role they would be
                                capable of playing in the current situation in Asia for their own
                                progress and to further international understanding, once they could
                                go ahead with their activities independently of the outside, in
                                internal peace and unity and in harmony with their neighbors. Today
                                more than ever, this is what France wishes for Vietnam as a whole.
                                Naturally it is up to this people, and to them alone, to choose the
                                means of achieving it, but any national effort that would be carried
                                out in Vietnam would find France ready, to the extent of her own
                                possibilities, to establish cordial cooperation with this country.”

                            activity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> said that it was possible
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had been working through
                            the French talking to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. General
                            Carter said that the Secretary had asked for any hunches on the
                            situation there, and although we lacked information because <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> had as yet been unable to make
                            his contacts with the Generals, he was prepared to offer the following
                            hunch: that is, that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has
                            known of our machinations for the last two or three days; that the
                            Generals are backing off; that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> also is backing off in the sense that he is trying
                            to do what the US wants and to put the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in as favorable a posture as possible. General Carter's
                            hunch was that the possibility of a Generals' coup is out; that in one
                            week's time the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will look the same
                            as it did as of the 20th of August; i.e. that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> will back off from repressive
                            action in an attempt to give at least the appearance of a rapprochement
                            with the US. General <persName corresp="#p_CLGMS1">Carter</persName>
                            said that there were several indications of this—the appointment of a
                            new Ambassador;<note n="8" xml:id="d26fn8">The new Vietnamese Ambassador
                                to the United States, Do Vang Ly.</note> Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s silence; the pro-government
                            rallies; the surfacing of pro-government Buddhists; the creation of a
                            new inter-sect committee; allowing Mau to go on leave; the release of
                            the students; the reopening of the schools; the easing of the curfew;
                            the return of Radio Saigon back to civilian control.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Defense said that in his opinion the Generals didn't
                            have a plan and never did, contrary to their assurances.</p>
                        <p>After discussion it was made clear that the Generals did not say that
                            they had a plan, but in their initial approach had said that they would
                            develop one if they got US assurances. All agreed that from the evidence
                            now available it looked as if the Generals were either backing off or
                            were wallowing but that we could not know until after their meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>. The Secretary of
                            State said that the situation on Saturday<note n="9" xml:id="d26fn9">August 24.</note> appeared to be that the Vietnamese military
                            wanted to mount a coup; that they wanted US assurances of support even
                                <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0082"/>though it would be a
                            Vietnamese affair; that our response was that we would support them in
                            an effort that was truly Vietnamese; that the main target was <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>; and that the Generals could keep
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> if they desired. By
                            this Saturday<note n="10" xml:id="d26fn10">August 31.</note> there does
                            not appear to be much in it. The Secretary felt that we should send a
                            cable to Lodge expressing these concerns, picking up the reference in
                            Lodge's remark that nothing seemed to be happening.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State said that one contingency we should look at
                            urgently, since it seemed to be the most likely one, was what we would
                            do if the Generals' approach was only an exercise in frustration and
                            gossip. Maybe the thing to do was to get the Generals back to fighting
                            the war.</p>
                        <p>There was some discussion of counter-indicators, e.g., the possibility of
                            riots, the reports of planned arrests of Generals and so on.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> asked if the cable to
                            Lodge ought not to withdraw some of the authority already delegated. He
                            was especially thinking of the instruction that permitted <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to talk with the Generals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> pointed out that
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> was authorized to
                            give assurances to the Generals and to review their planning but not to
                            engage in planning with them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Defense read the instructions to <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and all agreed that they were
                            appropriate and should not be altered.<note n="11" xml:id="d26fn11">Not
                                found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> pointed out that at
                            some stage, but certainly not until we had the results of <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' meeting with the Generals, we
                            would have to look at the question of whether we should cross over from
                            assuring the Generals to a policy of forcing them into a position in
                            which they had to take action, i.e., whether we could precipitate action
                            by the Generals. The question here was whether the Generals had enough
                            will and determination even to be forced. We could, however, know this
                            only if we had more information.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we needed papers on a much wider range of
                            contingencies. As he had said before, we needed a paper on the
                            contingency if there is no coup attempt. What we needed is one list of
                            the whole range of contingencies. One would be the frittering away of
                            the interest of the Generals in a coup attempt. Another would be if
                            their plan is inadequate in the US view for a successful coup.</p>
                        <p>The contingency paper dated August 30<note n="12" xml:id="d26fn12">
                                <ref target="#d25">Document 25</ref>.</note> was distributed, and
                            the Secretary of Defense said he thought the consolidated list of
                            contingencies and US responses ought to eliminate any assumptions. In
                            addition to those in the paper, which were based on the assumption that
                            a coup would in fact be mounted, we ought to examine several <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0083"/>more. One was that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> eased pressures either in arresting Generals or
                            arresting a few key ones. Another was that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> eased
                            pressures and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> takes power
                            with the title of Prime Minister. Another was that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> eased pressures and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> becomes less prominent.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> and others also suggested
                            adding the following contingencies:</p>
                        <p>1. Political intervention by a third party, e.g., bringing the matter
                            before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. Pressure in the US to reduce aid unless <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> does things he is not now doing.</p>
                        <p>3. In the event of a successful coup—the slate of possible Ministers and
                            the various forms that a government might take.</p>
                        <p>4. Request for a variety of US military help—from the use of helicopters
                            ranging up to US troops.</p>
                        <p>5. Large scale civil disorders—from riots through civil war and including

                        <p>304. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>. Called on <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Lalouette</persName>, the French Ambassador. He has
                            been here five years; is intelligent; and has the reputation of
                            sincerely favoring U.S. program here. He expressed himself as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has a steadfastness and
                            determination which is rare in Asia and is valuable. In many ways he is
                            the best Chief of State in Southeast Asia. His weakness is that he is
                            not a political leader, cannot make speeches, cultivate the press,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>He is much better off with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            than without him. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is
                            efficient and intelligent. The war against the Viet Cong can be won with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> administration in
                            office.</p>
                        <p>The present situation is largely the work of the press, helped greatly by
                            Vietnamese ineptness. In the days of French administration, suicides of
                            Buddhists were very common and had no effect whatever on the population.
                            They create much more excitement abroad than they do in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Things are now quieting down; Buddhists are being released. Decree Law
                            No. 10 will be repealed. The pagodas will be repaired at government
                            expense; a ceremony is planned to be held at the Xa Loi Pagoda.</p>
                        <p>Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> will soon go away for
                            several months on a trip to India and the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Vietnamese officials have been waiting for a dialogue to begin with
                            me which has not taken place. They are, therefore, fuming in on
                            themselves, which is bad. My comment: This is not strictly true. In my
                            conversations with both <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, I suggested a number of
                            things which should be done.</p>
                        <p>There is still some danger of a violent uprising, but it is getting
                            less.</p>
                        <p>He asked: What could be done to please U.S. I said: Get rid of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>s. He said: This is
                            impossible, but it might be possible to bring in someone with titles of
                            Prime Minister and reduce <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s
                            role.</p>
                        <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0085"/>
                        <p>In a year or two the guerrilla danger might be ended. The Viet Cong are
                            very discouraged and morale is very low in North Vietnam, concerning
                            which he said he was well informed inasmuch as the French have a mission
                            there. When the guerrilla war is ended, it might be possible for the
                            South Vietnamese, who would then be much stronger than the North
                            Vietnamese, to propose trading some of their rice for North Vietnamese
                            coal. This might lead towards a unified Vietnam with South Vietnam the
                            dominant element. But all of this was remote.</p>
                        <p>When I left, he said: Let me say two things—first, try to calm American
                            opinion and, second, no coupe.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> called on the
                            Secretary at 5:00 p.m. on August 30. One of the subjects discussed
                            was:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Vietnam</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the press both here and in France was giving the
                            impression that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName>
                            had been summoned to this meeting because of General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s statement on Vietnam.<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">See <ref target="#d26fn7">footnote 7,
                                    Document 26</ref>.</note> The Secretary said
                            that this was obviously not true and that it was desirable to correct
                            this impression. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> agreed. He said that while he had not seen the
                            final version of the French statement on Vietnam right after it had been
                            made, he had seen initial <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0086"/>drafts
                            two weeks ago while he was still in Paris. He said that in essence the
                            statement reiterated the points which General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had made in his meeting with
                            the President in the spring of 1961.<note n="3" xml:id="d28fn3">President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> visited
                                France May 31-June 2, 1961. Records of his conversations with
                                President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">Charles De Gaulle</persName>
                                are in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 66 D 110, CF
                                1891.</note> The French did not feel that a military solution could
                            work.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that it was the other side which is seeking to impose
                            a military solution. We did not seek South Vietnam as an ally and we
                            would be perfectly happy if it were truly nonaligned as many other
                            countries are. However, the facts of the situation were that Communist
                            guerrillas supported from the North were seeking to subjugate the
                            country. This we had to resist. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said that he appreciated this position.
                            Certainly the French had no immediate solution to the problem. General
                            de <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">Gaulle</persName>'s statement was
                            intended merely as a long term proposition, not as something that could
                            be put into effect in the near future.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that France had a delegation in Hanoi. He said he
                            hoped the French would let us have some of the information which the
                            French delegation developed there. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> promised to look into this. He said that he had
                            read an article in a recent <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
                            publication comparing the positions of Mao Tse Tung and <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> on the situation in
                            Vietnam. Mao, according to this publication, was for the continuation
                            and intensification of the war, while Ho was for peace. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said that the French
                            agreed with this analysis and he suggested that it would be useful to
                            compare notes on the respective positions of Mao and Ho.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the Soviets had recently created the impression in
                            connection with Laos that they had not much influence in Southeast Asia.
                            This might be true; on the other hand, it was also possible that the
                            Soviets wanted us to believe that this was so. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> was inclined to believe that the
                            Soviets had in fact little influence in the area. On the other hand,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> was basically
                            anti-Chinese. A neutral solution for Vietnam was therefore possible and
                            might be the best solution. The Secretary repeated that we had been
                            drawn into the conflict because of Viet [Cong?] activity. There was as
                            yet no indication that a truly neutral Vietnam was possible. A false
                            neutrality would be most dangerous as it would have repercussions on
                            Vietnam's neighbors, especially on Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said the present
                            situation was most difficult. He felt <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was undesirable; however, there was nobody in sight
                            to replace him. The Secretary said the main problem seemed to be
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and he wondered whether the
                            enticements of <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0087"/>Paris could not be
                            offered to him. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName>
                            said that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s father was going
                            to Paris, but there were no indications that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> himself planned to retire.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName>, while admitting
                            that the neutral solution was not as yet effective in Laos, said that at
                            least it has stopped the war there. The Secretary said the situation in
                            Laos was different. If every foreigner really left Laos it was quite
                            possible that there could be no internal security problem and that the
                            country would not create problems for any of its neighbors. The same was
                            not necessarily true of a unified Vietnam. The Vietnamese are more
                            active and ambitious and might create problems.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said he planned
                            to emphasize to the press that it was absurd to think that France was

                            necessary sea and airlift so that the three reinforced battalions and
                            command elements can close Saigon in 24 hours. Initial heliborne
                            elements from TF 76.5 would close Saigon in two hours.</p>
                        <p>a. One BLT, at sea, can close Saigon in eight hours, with initial
                            elements arriving in two hours. This BLT is now located 50 miles East of
                            Cap St Jacques (70 miles from Saigon). With advance warning, as tensions
                            increase, this force can be moved closer to shore and reaction times
                            reduced accordingly.</p>
                        <p>b. Two BLT's are on a four hour alert with associated airlift at Okinawa,

                        <p>One additional Marine BLT afloat has been directed to a position off
                            Vietnam and will be on station in approximately six days.</p>
                        <p>For backup, there are two additional battalions on Okinawa: one Marine
                            BLT and one battalion of the 173d Airborne Brigade. This backup force

                        <p>284. Eyes only for Ambassador. Following is report to you on today's
                            meeting which reviewed your 383<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">
                                <ref target="#d20">Document 20</ref>.</note> and other messages.</p>
                        <p>Discussion focused on “inertia” mentioned your para 5. Generals so far
                            appear have no plan and little momentum. Further, bits and pieces of
                            information here suggest that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> are
                            moving to normalize situation and head off possibilities of being upset.
                            Prospect of changing government by strong and concerted Vietnamese
                            elements seem very thin on basis of any hard information we have. This
                            raises possibility that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> will
                            try to ease internal and international pressures and perhaps bring about
                            quiet liquidation of potential opposition. Possibility therefore
                            increasingly is that if there is to be a change, it can only be brought
                            about by American rather than Vietnamese effort. Obviously, an abortive
                            effort inspired by or attributed to the United States will be
                            disastrous. Central question therefore comes to be how much reality
                            there is in attitude expressed by generals with whom contacts have been
                            made and their capabilities and determination with respect to what has
                            been said thus far. The distinction between what is desirable and what
                            is possible is one which we may have to face in the next few days. This
                            telegram changes none of your instructions but expresses our uneasiness
                            at the absence of bone and muscle as seen from here. Can assure you that
                            highest levels in Washington are s2ivina this problem almost full-time
                            attention.</p>

                        <p>On instructions from Ambassador had a talk with Brig Gen Khiem, Chief

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> was at first reluctant to
                            say anything, indicating he was just a junior officer and that I should
                            talk to <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> who was
                            really the head guy.</p>
                        <p>I said I would be delighted to talk to <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big
                                Minh</persName>, but he had put the word that no Americans were to
                            contact him.</p>
                        <p>He stated <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> had stopped
                            planning at this time, and was working on other methods—these he did not
                            elaborate on.</p>
                        <p>He said because <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> had
                            called off the planning so had others mentioning only himself and Gen
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>.</p>
                        <p>He said all concerned had such a respect for <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> they followed his
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>Asked where Col Thao, <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> 0483,<note n="3" xml:id="d33fn3">
                                <ref target="#d22">Document 22.</ref>
                            </note> stood in the picture. <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> replied he knew Thao was making plans-but that few
                            of military trusted him because of his V.C. background—and that he might
                            still be working for the V.C. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> This might
                            be an indicator of the other method, but this just conjecture.</p>
                        <p>Then he went on to say the Generals were not ready as they did not have
                            enough forces under their control compared to those under President and
                            now in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>He indicated they, the Generals, did not want to start anything they
                            could not successfully finish.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> then said Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> was not in <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName>'s confidence. Comment:
                            Probably because of Don's present position because they are not personal
                            friends.</p>
                        <p>At a meeting yesterday, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            said he now went along with everything the U.S. wants to do, and even
                            had the backing of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. I said this was news to me. <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> said he wondered if <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is again trying to flush out the
                            Generals. He intimated the Generals do not have too much trust in
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and that he's such a
                            friend of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJH1">Richardson</persName> (<gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>), the Generals wonder if Mr <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> were on the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> payroll. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> (A new angle
                            indeed).</p>
                        <p>He also stated <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> and
                            others could not put too much backing on Mr Connie's<note n="4" xml:id="d33fn4">Reference is to Conein.</note> word as representing
                            U.S. because he was low in position in <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>. It would take someone like myself or Ambassador Lodge
                            to give them complete confidence. Though it was my purpose to do just
                            that—in view of what <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> had
                            already admitted <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0092"/>I decided not
                            to—and told <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> that I would
                            be glad to talk to <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName>.
                            But we would have to arrange the meeting. He said he would. No date
                            set.</p>
                        <p>I asked if someone couldn't confront the <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>s with the fact that their absence from the scene was
                            the key to the overall solution. He replied that for anyone to do that
                            would be self immolation—he also went on to say he doubted if the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>s and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> could be split.</p>
                        <p>He did say that Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> was going
                            to present a plan to the President next week with the backing of the
                            Generals. This was similar to one I had heard mentioned before; that of
                            placing three Generals in key Cabinet positions, Interior, Defense, and
                                <gloss target="#t_DGI1">DGI</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would get some job such as Chief of Cabinet or a
                            government coordinator.</p>
                        <p>So we see we have an “organization de confusion” with everyone suspicious
                            of everyone else and none desiring to take any positive action as of
                            right now. You can't hurry the east.</p>
                        <p>Maybe my meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName>,
                            if it occurs, will smoke out other ghosts.</p>
                        <p>Regards. Ambassador Lodge has seen.</p>

                        <p>This marks the end of one week which began with your instructions of last
                            Sunday. We used every asset that we had including General <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harkins</persName>. Our record has been thoroughly
                            respectable throughout and we have shown our willingness to put
                            ourselves on the line.</p>
                        <p>2. At some indeterminate date in the future [if?] some other group with
                            the necessary strength and lust for office comes forward, we can
                            contemplate another effort.</p>
                        <p>3. I believe the government suspects us of trying to engineer a coup.
                            This belief plus the fact that I have been strictly correct and have not
                            in any way sought to flatter or cajole them have put them in an
                            apprehensive state of mind. They also believe I could say something
                            which would help them with U.S. public opinion if they did something to
                            justify it. Finally they expect me to make a report to Washington.</p>
                        <p>4. Perhaps an arrangement could be worked out whereby the following could
                            be made to happen: Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to
                            leave the country, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s
                            functions to be limited entirely to Strategic Hamlets, the office of
                            Prime Minister to be created and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> to become Prime Minister; Archbishop Thuc to leave
                            the country. In addition the students and Buddhists would be liberated;
                            Decree Law 10 would be repealed; the pagodas would be repaired and
                            conciliatory gestures would be made. All of this, if agreed to might be
                            announced by President in Washington. I think there is a dependable
                            person of highest quality and prestige who would be the go-between. I
                            would not talk of this to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> or
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> without further
                            clearance with you.</p>
                        <p>5. I think the U.S. Government was right to instruct me as it did last
                            Sunday not only because of the state of opinion in America and Free
                            World but because the Government of Viet-Nam has acted both as liars and
                            criminals. But now the only attempt to change the government which would
                            succeed would be one which the U.S. could mount itself and, of course,
                            that is out of the question.</p>
                        <p>6. To take up a different but related matter, I am very reliably informed
                            that French Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Lalouette</persName>
                            was with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> for four hours on
                            August 20 when the attack on the pagodas took place. I am also advised
                            by a dependable source that he wants the U.S. Government out of Viet-Nam
                            so that the French can become the intermediary between South and North
                            Viet-Nam. On Friday (the day on which I had my talk with Lalouette)<note n="4" xml:id="d34fn4">See <ref target="#d27">Document
                                27</ref>.</note> he gave a lunch at which were present the Papal
                            Delegate and the Italian and Australian Ambassadors. After the
                            Australian had gone <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Lalouette</persName>
                            said: “We must save the family”, as though the family were the first
                            consideration.</p>
                        <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0094"/>
                        <p>7. I have good reason to believe that the Holy See would be willing to
                            intervene with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>.
                            I understand that the Papal Delegate told <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that he had betrayed his church and his country. I
                            am reliably advised that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is
                            in a highly volatile state of mind and that some sort of gesture through
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to North Viet-Nam is not
                            impossible.</p>
                        <p>8. As one more persuasive factor in our dealings with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would it be possible for House or House
                            Committee to cut our appropriation for foreign aid for Viet-Nam? Giving
                            me chance to get <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to agree to our
                            points on the ground that this would facilitate restoration of the item.
                            I am too far away to know whether or not this would be practical
                            politics. But here it could have certain advantages.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State began the meeting by saying that we were back to
                            Wednesday of last week.<note n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">August 21.</note> He
                            suggested that we go to the original problem: What factors made us think
                            well of a coup? These factors were still relevant to our basic problem.
                            He felt that we should not rule out our attitude towards <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> as an individual. The problem is
                            what <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> did, the policies they followed
                            that eroded solidarity in Viet-Nam for pursuing the war, international
                            support, and US public opinion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State said that we should consider a message to Lodge
                            picking up his suggestion<note n="3" xml:id="d37fn3">See <ref target="#d34">Document 34.</ref>
                            </note> of telling <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> the
                            problem in the US of continuing support and opening a discussion with
                            Lodge as to what we should get [from?] the Government of South Viet-Nam
                            with respect to the following: Buddhists, students, the military
                            command, free scope for US advisers, and Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> out of the country on a visit.
                            Additional measures might be a real effort to patch up relations with
                            neighboring countries including Cambodia—in other words, a total program
                            to achieve what the Nhus were undercutting. The Secretary was reluctant
                            to start by saying that the number one problem was removing <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. He was also clear that engineering
                            a coup ourselves was something we could not do.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Defense said that he strongly favored the Secretary of
                            State's ideas. He felt that the initial step was to reestablish
                            relations between US representatives and their opposite numbers in the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and especially Lodge and
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State said that an extremely important item to tell
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was that he must not
                            decapitate the military command because of rumors of a coup attempt but
                            get on with the war.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if anyone had any doubts that the coup was off. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Kattenburg</persName> said that he had
                            some doubts. He said that the <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>

                            and that it was an enormous pity that this effect was counteracted by a
                            too rapid pull-back from that broadcast the next day. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Kattenburg</persName> said that the Generals were
                            very, very suspicious of the US and needed the reassurances they had
                            asked for but had never gotten. In <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0097"/>this respect it was tragic<note n="5" xml:id="d37fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> added the following
                                change in his own hand: “it should be noted,” which was apparently
                                intended to replace “it was tragic.”</note> that <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> had not carried out his
                            instructions, i.e., had not given <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> the reassurances even though <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> had said that the plotting had
                            stopped. The Secretaries of State and Defense said that they thought
                            that <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> was absolutely
                            right to stop before giving reassurances in the light of what <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> had told him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that he quite
                            agreed that <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> was right in
                            not following through with reassurances. He thought that what Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Kattenburg</persName> meant by what he
                            had said was that the Generals' need for reassurances that the US was
                            really behind them was a crucial factor. Whether or not it was true, the
                            Generals believed that the authors of the 1960 coup had been encouraged
                            in their action by low level <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> people
                            in violation of US Government policy. On this occasion the Generals had
                            been contacted only by two low level <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            people and they feared a repetition of 1960. Their suspiciousness was
                            enhanced by the close relationship <persName corresp="#p_RJH1">Richardson</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            Station Chief, has had with brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. Against this background, they tended to believe
                            what <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had told them—that he
                            was in communication with the US, that he was doing what the US wanted
                            him to do and that he had had the approval of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> asked the Secretary of
                            State if he could pick up the Secretary's suggestion of getting back to
                            the basic factors in the situation and give his analysis of them. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that there were
                            four factors in the basic problem. The first factor was the attitude of
                            the people and especially of the middle level officers and bureaucrats
                            who would have to carry on the war under any government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked why Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> thought this was key
                            and what evidence he had that these people were in fact disaffected. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> distinguished between
                            what we knew of the attitude of these people and why they were key. He
                            felt that they were key because they were the ones who had to carry on
                            the activities of the government. (What Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> should have said explicitly but only implied was
                            that of his four factors the reason he had put this one first was that
                            pursuing the war to a successful conclusion was the most important of
                            all and that doing this required the cooperation and support of the
                            middle level officers and bureaucrats.)</p>
                        <p>On the question of evidence of the attitude of these people, we had
                            relatively little information and certainly no statistics. However, we
                            had some information from conversations between these people and Embassy
                            officials.</p>
                        <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0098"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Kattenburg</persName> said that he felt
                            that they were disaffected, that he himself had talked to only three
                            such people who were, but that other Embassy officers had talked to
                            others who were. Also, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Kattenburg</persName> said, we must consider as valid evidence the
                            testimony of seasoned newspapermen such as Trumbull and Keyes Beech who
                            talked to these people and who uniformly reported disaffection. The
                            Secretary of Defense felt that this reflected that the disaffected
                            people that we had talked to were only those in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that his second
                            factor was the effect of an American acquiescence in what had happened
                            in Viet-Nam especially in Southeast Asia but also in Korea where they
                            were watching us closely to see how much repression we would tolerate as
                            a guide to the repression they contemplated during their upcoming
                            election.</p>
                        <p>The third factor was Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. We
                            had the experience of his attempting to throw out the key American
                            advisers in the provinces and the strategic hamlet program. This would
                            undoubtedly be revived. Also Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> had said <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would engage in shenanigans in Laos and Cambodia.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said he thought he
                            would also do so with the North Vietnamese and we knew he had been in
                            contact with them some months ago. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that sensitive information showed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had been behind the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> statement, at least
                            to the extent that what he had told the French Ambassador gave <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> the notion.</p>
                        <p>The fourth factor was US domestic opinion and world opinion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that his
                            recommendation was we now move to the political and diplomatic arena;
                            that we open tough negotiations with President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, maintaining with him and
                            publicly our position of disapproval of recent actions; that we ought to
                            consider telling <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that we
                            had temporarily suspended aid pending the outcome of these negotiations;
                            that this was not an ultimatum but only a position for negotiations to
                            bring about a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> posture that would
                            permit us to continue our support. This move had the advantage of giving
                            Lodge some leverage, of signaling the rest of Asia that we were not
                            condoning <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> actions and also help with
                            domestic public opinion. Most importantly of all, however, it would
                            signal to the rest of Viet-Nam that we were doing our utmost to change
                            the nature of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policies. We would
                            then negotiate with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> for an
                            acceptable arrangement. The disadvantage was that it would interrupt the
                            momentum of the war effort, but this had perhaps already happened. The
                            Secretary of State said he would not exaggerate what <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said to the French, that was not
                            exactly treasonable and, if it was, we have been a little treasonable
                            too.</p>
                        <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0099"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we should look at the things that we wanted to
                            extract from these negotiations. It might well be that the effect of the
                            transaction would be wholesome in getting more cooperation from South
                            Viet-Nam. They might have had a scare during these recent days too.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary was not inclined to start with an actual suspension of aid
                            but a statement that without <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> changes
                            it might not be possible to continue aid. On the question of
                            international opinion as a result of the repression of the last few
                            weeks, this might be turned around if there was in fact a turn-around by
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. On Vietnamese opinion, his
                            feeling was that the disaffection had not yet spilt outside Saigon but,
                            if the policies of repression continued, then the disaffection would
                            seep out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that this was
                            not a problem of religious persecution, that the Buddhists had never
                            been persecuted, that the line should be that the action against the
                            Buddhists was not religious persecution but to remove political efforts
                            under the cloak of Buddhism. The Secretary said that this was impossible
                            for us to maintain and he was not at all sure it was true, but that if
                            there was anything to what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said it would have to come out of the actions of
                            conciliation the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> now took.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> said that there had
                            been world-wide condemnation of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            actions; that if US policy implied that we continued to support such a
                            government without complaint the world would blame us for supporting
                            both the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and its action if its
                            actions continued bad, as, for example, the censorship remained in
                            force. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName>'s point was
                            that it would be no easy task to turn around world opinion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Defense said that we must work out a way of continuing
                            to help the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> against the Viet Cong.
                            He agreed that it should not start with a suspension of aid. We need to
                            reopen communications with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            to get his ideas about what comes next. He said that part of the problem
                            was the press-an assumption that the US was willing to change the
                            situation when in fact it may not be able to change the situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Kattenburg</persName> said that his
                            feeling, and he felt <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName>'s was that if we
                            acquiesce in what has happened or even if we acquiesce with halfway
                            measures—i.e., <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> negotiations with
                            puppet bonzes—we will be butted out of the country within six months to
                            a year<note n="6" xml:id="d37fn6">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Kattenburg</persName> later stated that
                                Lodge specifically asked him, if he got the chance, to make this
                                point. (Department of State, Office of the Historian, Vietnam

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> asked what was behind
                            this conclusion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Kattenburg</persName>
                            said that the recent actions of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            have made the people the unwilling allies of the Viet Cong; that he had
                            known <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> for 10 years and
                            admired him, but that he had fumed into a petty dictator inseparable
                            from <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and that the general
                            expectation in South Viet-Nam would be that the Viet Cong would win.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that the
                            discontent was confined to the cities which was only 15 percent of the
                            population; the villagers were not affected. The feeling in the cities
                            is worse now than ever before but not that much worse. The government
                            had actually done well with US help that had begun in 1961 and though
                            this was a bad period he felt the government could succeed. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KPM1">Kattenburg</persName> said that there
                            was one new factor. The population was in high hopes following the
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> broadcast but could do nothing
                            because of the many guns in the street. If we patch up with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, we may survive for a few months but popular
                            discontent will crescendo. The Secretary of State said that this was
                            speculation. We must start with the situation we are now facing. He felt
                            that we, first, should decide that we will not pull out of Viet-Nam and,
                            second, that the US is not going to operate a coup d'etat itself. We
                            were making steady progress during the first six months of this year and
                            what we should do is go down the middle of the track and hope to recover
                            that.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that he agreed. He recognized the evils of Diem
                            but has seen no alternative to him. Certainly we can't pull out. We must
                            reestablish ourselves and stop playing cops and robbers. We might cut
                            down on aid and tell <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that
                            he had created a situation which we cannot handle politically and he
                            must do 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Certainly the US itself could not pull a coup
                            and certainly there were bad situations in South Viet-Nam. However,
                            there were bad situations in the US. It was difficult to live with Otto
                            Passman but we couldn't pull a coup on him.<note n="7" xml:id="d37fn7">Regarding Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s remarks, <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Smith</persName>'s memorandum of discussion reads as follows:
                                “The Vice President stated his view that he had not known of U.S.
                                actions taken last Saturday until the following Tuesday meeting. He
                                had never been sympathetic with our proposal to produce a change of
                                government in Vietnam by means of plotting with Vietnamese generals.
                                Now that the generals had failed to organize a coup, he thought that

                        <p>The important thing is to win the war. It is important to maintain the
                            leverage of US discontent both in our public posture and in our private
                            conversations with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. We want
                            to go to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> with a frank but
                            tough line. We must insist he lay off the Generals and not arrest them
                            and we must be blunt about this. We must return to the situation before
                            the 24th of August. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> ought
                            to have a dialogue with the real Buddhists (<persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> suggested the venerable <persName corresp="#p_KHIET1">Khiet</persName> as a possibility). We ought to
                            hit hard on press censorship. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> ought to open his conversations with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> by saying that he has come to
                            talk. The US is troubled and these are the reasons. The conversation
                            ought to close with the problem of the Nhus. This could be settled in
                            later discussions—leave them till last. Our sanction is that Congress
                            may have to force us to suspend aid. The President at his next press
                            conference would have to express his disapproval of what has happened in
                            Viet-Nam. One reason for this is that the US continues to suffer
                            casualties in Viet-Nam—e.g., <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>
                            today juxtapositions the repression of the Buddhists and the US
                            disapproval of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> actions with a story
                            of two more Americans killed. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> must face these facts. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will say that public opinion and Congress don't
                            understand the true situation because of erroneous press reports but our
                            reply should be tant pis. The fact is thus what they believe, whether
                            the information they base their conclusion on is right or wrong. Lodge
                            should not say that aid has been suspended but that suspension is around
                            the bend and will be forced upon us. We must establish a posture of
                            candid and critical discussion privately and also this should be the
                            general impression publicly both in Viet-Nam and abroad. If the people
                            of South Viet-Nam decide to make a change of government they know where
                            we are. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> knows where we are
                            too if he wants to change his policies. The impression should be left
                            with the people of South Viet-Nam <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0102"/>that we are there trying not to operate a coup d'etat on the
                            government but to improve the government.<note n="4" xml:id="d38fn4">

                        <p>294. Eyes only for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. Re your 391,<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">
                                <ref target="#d34">Document 34</ref>.</note> agree your conclusion
                            favoring direct effort on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. US cannot
                            abandon Viet-Nam and while it will support Vietnamese effort to change
                            government that has good prospects success US should not and would not
                            mount and operate one. To use your metaphor, when the spaghetti was
                            pushed, it curled; now we must try pulling. In the meantime, our primary
                            objective remains winning war and we concur your suggestion that we
                            should now reopen communications with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. Decision on exact course awaits your
                            recommendations and consideration by highest authority. What follows is
                            thinking of interdepartmental meeting chaired by Secretary today.</p>
                        <p>As to general posture, it seems desirable to maintain both publicly and
                            in our private talks with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> the
                            leverage of US discontent with repression which has eroded war effort
                            within Viet-Nam as well as support of Congress, US public, and world.
                            Impression should be, both privately and publicly, that US engaged in
                            candid and critical discussion to improve government not overthrow it.
                            Decision on changing government is Vietnamese affair.</p>
                        <p>In your talk with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, our
                            thought is you should first stress common interest in defeating Viet
                            Cong. Then in frank but tough line point out that daily juxtaposition of
                            continuing American casualties and massive US aid with repressive
                            measures contrary deepest American convictions will make it difficult
                            for Executive and Congress to continue support. Common problem for US
                            and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in general and <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0103"/>you and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in particular is to work out set of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policies and actions that will make
                            possible continued US support. But time is rather short. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> may well be obliged
                            at next press conference to express US disapproval of repressive
                            measures. Should we find it impossible to reach an agreement with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on a program to undo the damage caused
                            by recent <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> actions, then suspension
                            of aid might soon be forced upon us.</p>
                        <p>Specific policies and actions should be designed to develop political
                            support within Viet-Nam necessary to win the war and also to restore
                            damaged image abroad. Our feeling is that your list of specifics should
                            begin with blunt warning, if required, not to arrest Generals who are so
                            badly needed in war effort, and with strong demand Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> leave country on extended holiday.
                            (Question of future role of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            could be left to later discussions.)</p>
                        <p>In the intermediate discussion the most important is relations with the
                            Buddhists. Our feeling is that you should frankly say that negotiations
                            with puppet bonzes will not accomplish purpose. We recognize that the
                            other side of this coin is that we must assure <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that we will make every effort to
                            persuade the Buddhist leaders to throw themselves fully into the common
                            effort for the independence and security of South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Other points might be:</p>
                        <p>1. Repeal of Decree 10 by immediate executive action or by special
                            session of the National Assembly.</p>
                        <p>2. Restoration of damaged pagodas.</p>
                        <p>3. Release of students and reopening of closed universities.</p>
                        <p>4. Removal of press censorship.</p>
                        <p>At some stage, you will wish to talk about future relationships between
                            American advisers et al and free scope to them in helping to carry on
                            the war effort at all appropriate governmental levels. (In this respect
                            we fully agree with <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>'
                            decision to refrain from giving assurances in light of statements made
                            to him. He and all military advisers should now concentrate on
                            reestablishing normal relationships at all levels <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to get on with the war.)</p>
                        <p>Also would you think it useful if we tried to get Vatican to summon
                            Archbishop Thuc to Rome for lengthy consultations?</p>
                        <p>If initial discussions go well, at some stage you may want to urge some
                            form of reorganization of government introducing Generals and perhaps
                            other civilian leaders into ministerial posts.</p>
                        <p>It may be important at a fairly early stage to raise the subject of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> improving its relations with its
                            neighbors and especially to avoid interfering with Cambodian traffic on
                            the Mekong.</p>
                        <p>The above is not an instruction but intended only for your comments.</p>
                        <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0104"/>
                        <p>We will appreciate your views on it and on any additional actions we
                            should require of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in order to
                            get on with the task.</p>
                        <p>President has reviewed this message and approves it in general. He
                            suggests you should also plan your response to probable <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> claim that all this trouble comes
                            from irresponsible press. He thinks you should say we hold no brief for
                            press but <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had been playing
                            into their hands. Fact is that actions of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> have now created a situation which is very difficult
                            indeed for USG. For example, large cut in aid program in House largely
                            due to sense of disillusionment in whole effort in Viet-Nam. There are
                            reports that still further cuts may be pressed on same ground, and in
                            such a case USG simply would not have resources to sustain massive
                            present level of support. So we need very quick and substantial response
                            to your demarche. You should add that President will be commenting on
                            situation in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> in TV interview to be
                            taped Monday a.m. at Hyannis and broadcast Monday evening. While in this
                            interview he will be as restrained as possible, if asked it will be
                            impossible to avoid some expression of concern. This expression,
                            however, will be mild in comparison to what may have to be said soon
                            unless there is major improvement.</p>

                            must keep our eye fixed on the main purpose of our presence in South
                            Viet-Nam and everyone on the US side needs to review the bidding on this
                            elementary purpose: why we are there, why are we asking our fellows to
                            be killed and what is getting in the way of accomplishing our purpose.
                            The actions of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>s have eroded this purpose-inside
                            Viet-Nam and internationally and they have also eroded our capacity to
                            provide political leadership in the US necessary to support the effort
                            in Viet-Nam. To raise these questions is not merely an emotional
                            reaction to two individuals. They <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0105"/>involve the fundamental requirement of political leadership in
                            Viet-Nam which is necessary to coalesce the Vietnamese people in a war
                            effort which we can support. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> must realize that his obligation of political
                            leadership runs to the solidarity of his people which may require
                            conciliatory actions which are distasteful to him personally. He must
                            make a systematic effort to improve his international position, and a
                            demonstration to the American people that we are not asking Americans to
                            be killed to support Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s

                        <p>1. Your 295 states the issue admirably.</p>
                        <p>2. I agree that we must keep our eyes fixed on main purpose of our
                            presence in South Vietnam which at the very least is to deny this area
                            to the Communists and, hopefully, also to transform South Vietnam into a
                            country strong enough to stand by itself. It is for these enormously
                            important reasons that we are asking our fellow citizens to risk their
                            lives.</p>
                        <p>3. I also agree that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and Nhus have
                            made it much harder to achieve this purpose and that a continuation of
                            the status quo may make it impossible to achieve.</p>
                        <p>4. I do not, however, exclude the possibility that an improved situation
                            can be created if Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and
                            Archbishop Thuc could leave the country; if <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is restricted to work on Strategic Hamlet <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0107"/>Program, if the post of Prime Minister
                            is created with <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> as Prime
                            Minister, and if I get on a footing with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in which I try to influence them to act like
                            responsible political leaders in the best sense of the word. In addition
                            I should get assurance of repeal of Decree Law Number Ten, restoration
                            of damaged pagodas, release of students, and Buddhist prisoners,
                            reopening of closed universities, removal of press censorship, and
                            negotiation with true Buddhist leaders on implementation of June 16

                            draft them, but I continue to think they should not be used. In
                            particular, the possibility of a reference to French position in Laos
                            has been discussed with <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                            who strongly advises against it. Argument is that we really do not want
                            larger French presence in Laos, where French military missions have been
                            most unhelpful, and that any linkage of Laos with South Vietnam raises
                            specter of neutralist solution. More generally, we find only our own
                            personal irritation as an argument against well-established conclusion
                            that we do best when we ignore Nosey Charlie.</p>

                            interview</p>
                        <p>The difficulties in South Vietnam are serious, but it is important to
                            keep the issues clear.</p>
                        <p>1. We agree with the Government of South Vietnam on many central issues.
                            We both want to see South Vietnam strong and free. We both want to
                            defeat the brutal and aggressive effort of the Communists to take the
                            country over by force. So we both support the campaign against the
                            Communists. We both support the Strategic Hamlet Program, which has the
                            double purpose of assisting self-defense in the villages and promoting
                            strong programs of economic and social development. It is important not
                            to forget that President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            has in the past given outstanding leadership to his people at a time
                            when many of those in the West who had most experience in the country
                            thought that everything was lost.</p>
                        <p>2. Yet now there are serious differences with the Government of South
                            Vietnam over certain acts of arbitrary power, some of them strongly
                            repressive, which that government has allowed. Our difficulty over such
                            acts is double: First, as a democratic people, we cannot approve of this
                            kind of repression in a situation in which we are closely engaged and
                            where our resources provide much of the government's strength. Second,
                            we believe that such acts undermine the unity of the people of the
                            country, weaken confidence in the government, and so play into the hands
                            of the Communists.</p>
                        <p>3. We have an obligation to make our position clear on this matter, and
                            we certainly cannot approve such acts of repression. Our concern and our
                            sense of the urgent need for improvement are being continuously
                            communicated to the Vietnamese Government.</p>
                        <p>4. The larger question of the shape and structure of the Vietnamese
                            Government is one for the Vietnamese people themselves. The interest of
                            the United States here is that the Government of South Vietnam be able
                            to secure the effective support of its people in defending the freedom
                            of the country. We are making a large effort in South Vietnam, where
                            approximately 35 thousand American troops have served since General
                            Taylor's mission in 1961,<note n="5" xml:id="d43fn5">For documentation
                                on the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Mission to

                            been lost by hostile action. It is hard to see how we could continue
                            this effort if the essential conditions for success were no longer
                            present.</p>
                        <p>5. But it is too soon to conclude that we cannot find a good way out of
                            the present difficulties. Our support for the people of South Vietnam
                            against the Communist aggressors will continue as long as it is wanted
                            and can be effective.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Alternative comments on General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s statement, for possible use
                            on Monday TV interview</p>
                        <p>1. We have noted the French statement. General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> expressed similar views to
                            the President in 1961 in Paris,<note n="6" xml:id="d43fn6">See <ref target="#d29fn3">footnote 3, Document 29</ref>.</note> but at
                            that time it was his conviction that the West should give no military
                            help to South Vietnam against the Communists. If that is still his view,
                            it is hard to see how his expression of sympathy for the Vietnamese can
                            much affect the present situation. The U.S. will always welcome
                            additional French support for the independent non-Communist forces of
                            Southeast Asia, and we have been hoping for stronger French
                            participation in the support of the Government of Laos, where the
                            current policy of our two countries is in agreement.</p>
                        <p>2. We have noted the French statement. As we understand the matter from
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName>, this is merely
                            a restatement of a view General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> has held for a long time. He apparently believes
                            in neutralizing Vietnam, and not in giving help at present to those who
                            would resist Communism there. We of course have a different view; we do
                            not see how there can be independence and freedom for any part of
                            Vietnam if those who are ready to resist the Communists are not
                            supported.</p>
                        <p>So we have disagreed with the French over Vietnam. Fortunately in Laos we
                            have an agreed policy; there is much room there for increased French
                            activities and for increased French support of that hard-pressed
                            government.</p>
                        <p>3. We have noted the French statement, but we do not know just what it
                            means. If it means that France is now ready to share in the work of
                            resisting Communist aggression in Vietnam, we can only applaud this
                            change in French policy. Certainly, if the people of South Vietnam want
                            such French help, it will be welcome to us too. But if the statement
                            means that France does not believe in helping those who resist
                            Communism, we can only say that we continue to disagree. And if the
                            statement means that the Communist character of the regime in Hanoi and
                            its aggressive support of subversion in South Vietnam are not matters of
                            central importance, we simply do not understand it.</p>
                        <p>4. As we understand this statement, it is simply a general expression of
                            good will from a country which has no present responsibility in the area
                            and no intention of making any commitment of military or economic
                            resources to the defense of South Vietnam against Communist subversion
                            supported from the North. Expressions of good will are always
                            welcome.</p>

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> will resign, leave the
                            government service for good and move to Dalat after he has lifted
                            martial law, which he would prefer to do after certain U.S. agents who
                            he says are still promoting a coup d'etat against family have left.
                            “Everybody knows who they are”, he said. He would also appreciate
                            American radio in Vietnam stopping its attack on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and he suggested as a matter of national pride that
                            Americans coming to Vietnam be required to have Vietnamese visas. His
                            resignation would be announced as a sign of the success of the program
                            against the Viet Cong and it would be put out that things were going so
                            well that he no longer needed to stay in the government.</p>
                        <p>2. Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to leave September
                            17 for the Interparliamentary Union meeting in Yugoslavia, for a trip in
                            Italy and possibly a trip to the U.S. where she has been invited to come
                            as a guest of what he called the “Overseas Club” which I suspect is the
                            Overseas Press Club of New York.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">Numbered paragraph 3 (1 line) not
                            declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>4. A number of measures involving Buddhist prisoners will be taken to
                            ease these tensions.</p>
                        <p>5. Short of actual constitutional changes, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is prepared, as an altogether new departure and as a
                            public relations gesture, to consider broadening the membership of the
                            Cabinet and to have a de facto Prime Minister. I pointed out to him that
                            such a Prime Minister could absorb some of the criticism now going to
                            the President and could easily be replaced.</p>
                        <p>6. In the context of this last approach, he suggested a change in the
                            economic aid in terms of long range loans at low interest rates rather
                            than grants. He thought this would make it easier both for Americans and
                            Vietnamese because we would not have responsibility <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0111"/>for all the things that were done here
                            which we did not like. He seemed to like the idea of relenting on
                            austerity measures, such as dance halls for soldiers.</p>
                        <p>7. He said he could not leave the country because of his contacts with
                            the Viet Cong who, he said, were extremely discouraged and ready to give
                            up. He said that six months ago a Viet Cong colonel had offered to
                            desert with three battalions, but <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had told him not to desert but to stay at the Laos
                            frontier so he could secede at the right moment. He reported this to
                            Embassy at the time. There was a Viet Cong general in Cambodia who
                            wanted to see him. He said that not only was the Viet Cong discouraged,
                            it felt it had been used and let down by North Vietnam. He predicted
                            that pretty soon the only way to supply the Viet Cong would be by air.
                            Supply by sea was already prohibited, supply by land would soon be
                            virtually impossible. When supply was by air the planes would be shot
                            down.</p>
                        <p>8. He told of the ChiCom offer to sell two U-40 planes, which, I
                            understand, was reported by <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> 60 days ago.</p>

                                follows: “Foreign intervention must cease. The forces and the

                                cease-fire could presumably be arranged between the Diemist forces

                            with General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> on 31 August
                            1963.</p>
                        <p>1. Met General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> about 5:30 PM,
                            rather later than anticipated, and asked him what the situation was.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> clearly expected coup attempt, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName>'s special forces were
                            on full alert, and that they were in a position to prevent any coup
                            attempt from succeeding at this time. Planning would continue, he said,
                            but on tightly compartmented basis for security reason.</p>
                        <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0113"/>
                        <p>2. I then asked <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> if he aware
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> had seen
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> that morning and if
                            he knew what had been discussed. <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> said he had not heard of meeting and was sure <hi rend="italic">Big Minh</hi> had not been informed.</p>
                        <p>3. I then told <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> in effect that Generals could
                            do nothing, all planning had ceased, and perhaps best solution would be
                            for <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to become Prime Minister
                            with support of the Generals in exchange for more authority for
                                Army.<note n="2" xml:id="d46fn2">See <ref target="#d33">Document

                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> reacted strongly and, I
                            believe, sincerely. Was vehement in saying that <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> had not spoken for the rest of
                            Generals, admitted that activity had been curtailed because of apparent
                            security leaks, but insisted that under no circumstances would <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> be acceptable to them. Further, he
                            did not know why <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> had made
                            these statements, but believed it probable that they were deliberate
                            effort to mislead <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>.
                            Admitted possibility also that <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> had decided to turn against coup group, or might
                            be attempting to play lone hand.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> then said that would check
                            immediately with <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName>, and
                            that he would seek to bring <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>
                            to meeting that evening with Col Conein (for whom he specifically asked)
                            and myself. This he wanted to do if possible (although General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> might object for security
                            reasons) to confirm <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> was
                            not speaking for <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>.</p>
                        <p>6. I agreed to meeting, but pointed out that Americans now seemed
                            convinced as result of <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>'s
                            statements that Generals lacked will to effect coup, and that it might
                            be necessary for the Americans to continue supporting administration as
                            presently constituted. Best way of saving situation, I said seemed to be
                            for <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> to speak frankly to
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> replied he believed <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> would want to speak to
                            Ambassador, if to anyone.</p>
                        <p>7. I told him I doubted if this possible but would investigate and, in
                            any case, would meet him at 8 o'clock that evening. We broke up meeting
                            after this discussion.</p>
                        <p>8. At Ambassador's residence I discussed situation briefly with Mr. Dunn,
                            who advised me that proposed meeting with Ambassador was not desirable.
                            After picking up Col Conein I returned to agreed meeting place. There I
                            was again met by <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>, who asked
                            that Col Conein stand guard while he talked to me.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> said that he had reported
                            to <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, who had said, in
                            substance:</p>
                        <p>a. <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> had not yet informed
                            him of meeting with <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>.</p>
                        <p>b. He had definite information that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was aware Generals actively planning coup.</p>
                        <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0114"/>
                        <p>c. Had received information that Americans other than Conein and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 1ine not declassified</hi>] had contacted
                            lower-ranking Vietnamese officers, urging them to effect coup. In this
                            connection he mentioned that a Col Cuong (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>)
                            had evidently been so contacted.</p>
                        <p>d. Vietnamese Special Forces had been placed on alert as result of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s knowledge of Generals'
                            intentions, and it was therefore impossible to do anything at this
                            moment, without courting almost certain failure.</p>
                        <p>e. This did not mean planning was discontinued, or that he was not
                            determined to go ahead and overthrow government. Under no circumstances
                            would <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> be acceptable.</p>
                        <p>f. He was sorry if Americans believed that Generals lacked the will. They
                            did not, but at moment they lacked the means.</p>
                        <p>g. Americans should understand they had given so much to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> in the past that it was impossible
                            to organize counter-action in few days. Further, so far as most
                            Vietnamese officers were aware, US still supported present government.
                            Words had been said against it, but there were no overt actions to back
                            up the words. As result, whole operation against the government rested
                            upon his word and that of a few others, which was not enough for
                            immediate action by these officers.</p>
                        <p>h. Finally, he said, he understood why it was not feasible to talk to
                            Ambassador, and that he did not wish to speak to General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> at this time.</p>
                        <p>10. After thus expressing <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>'s

                            views. Said that as friend he wanted me to know he was irrevocably
                            committed against Nhus. Further, was confident that if US indicated firm
                            disapproval of Nhus they would be overthrown, but that this would take
                            time, given their present preponderance of power. Americans, like
                            Vietnamese, must be patient and persevering, and most important things
                            they could do at this time would be:</p>
                        <p>a. Clamp on tight security to protect Vietnamese who opposed Nhus,
                            and;</p>
                        <p>b. Indicate by actions, as well as words, that they (Americans) do not
                            support Nhus or their creatures.</p>

                        <p>1. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] surprised
                            that this news to U.S. Govt. They had reported months ago [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> policy was one of ultimate
                            neutralization and unification of Vietnam. It was “open secret” Saigon

                            with North. French policy over past year or more obviously that of

                            personally) was foregone conclusion.</p>
                        <p>2. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] had no hard
                            inter to back this up but repeated earlier statement that <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Maneli</persName> several times in past few months
                            has asked him tell <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> that

                        <p>3. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] spelled out
                            at some length his irritation with Americans for relying on “two-bit
                            agents” and ignoring seasoned observers such as self who in position
                            learn great deal. He then cited <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> press interview circa 8 May in which <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he looking forward to

                            anti-American.</p>
                        <p>4. Both [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] said
                            worst thing now would be for U.S. Govt to take precipitous action as was
                            case in Laos with Phoumi. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] then offered their services to negotiate with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. Both said <hi rend="italic">Nhu</hi> wants negotiate. Both convinced Madame

                            first step to save [garble] face. Apparently both recently in contact
                            with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> apparently volunteered that his

                            with some specific message he wants convey, but neither [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] willing take
                            initiative for such meeting or volunteer views. They waiting be
                            asked.</p>
                        <p>5. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] then said
                            he reliably informed that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> in
                            meeting with Generals “the other night” told them he aware some of them
                            thinking of fast action because they fear country lost without American
                            aid. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> then told them not
                            worry, other resources would be available if aid cut, and if worse came
                            to worse he, as Generals aware, had contacts with Northern brothers and
                            could get breathing spell by having North direct Southern guerrillas
                            ease off operations while negotiating more permanent settlement.</p>
                        <p>6. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] said he
                            fears U.S. Govt may be thinking of having Vietnamese troops march into
                            Saigon. This unthinkable as consequent slaughter would have worse
                            repercussions than Bay of Pigs. Both [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                not declassified</hi>] said they cabling home their assessment along
                            these lines and again asked Trueheart take initiative to go see [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>].</p>

                            situation will be more difficult. Buddhist and student trouble over, but
                            those behind these groups do not think issues settled and will continue
                            working together to overthrow government by any available means. <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> role always is to support
                            government.</p>
                        <p>3. General Duong Van Minh asked how to answer Americans who ask what we
                            think of present situation. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            replied either state no comment or say you do not have enough
                            information to comment.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> then dominated informal
                            conversation making following points:</p>
                        <p>a. In discussion difficulties of working with U.S. Govt., cited <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> as group that would like to see him
                            personally “out of way.” Local <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            personnel do their utmost to alienate people from supporting
                            government.</p>
                        <p>b. There has been mobilization of international press against <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, caused primarily by American press.
                            Many local American officials covertly encourage American newsmen to
                            report contrary to best interests of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>c. There now exists a mobilization aimed at overthrow of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> supported by secret elements of U.S.
                            Govt. This situation has intensified shortly after Test Ban Agreement
                            with Russians.<note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">The Treaty Banning Nuclear
                                Weapons Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under the Water,

                        </p>
                        <p>d. Referring to Highlanders and people along Cambodian border, certain
                            elements desire cause <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> more trouble
                            and thus will intensify efforts involving these groups. Cambodia severed
                            relations with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> only because a
                            foreign element insisted so that anti-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> groups can exploit the people..</p>

                        <p>f. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> told me both
                            Vietnam and U.S. Govt. are deeply committed to fighting Communism, and
                            that therefore it is necessary that Vietnamese people be very friendly
                            with U.S. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> could not
                            understand why there is no close relationship between American and
                            Vietnamese people.</p>
                        <p>g. I know without American aid we cannot exist. USG is only country
                            willing support our country without any strings attached. There are U.S.
                            Govt. personnel in Vietnam not working conscientiously for welfare of
                            Vietnamese people. This caused by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            personnel and certain so-called professional political affairs officers.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> now getting
                            better picture of situation; we can manage him-he will fully agree with

                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and that they are not as result of

                        <p>2. We assume that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and Nhus
                            are fully aware that USG encouraged Generals to attempt coup and that
                                <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> was instrumentality of this
                            encouragement. We estimate that they know good portion, possibly most of
                            substantial details of our approaches. Our impression is that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> realizes, however, that it is still in
                            profound difficulty with military leaders, good portion of population,

                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and U.S. Govt will be to reach

                            and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> must realize that it will have
                            to give reasonable satisfaction to USG to continue major programs even

                        <p>3. There is even possibility that all major programs can go forward as in

                        <p>[Here follows discussion of unrelated subjects.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cronkite: Mr. President, the only hot war we've got running at the
                            moment is of course the one in Viet-Nam, and we have our difficulties
                            there, quite obviously.</p>
                        <p>The President. I don't think that unless a greater effort is made by the
                            Government to win popular support that the war can be won out there. In
                            the final analysis, it is their war. They are the ones who have to win
                            it or lose it. We can help them, we can give them equipment, we can send
                            our men out there as advisers, but they have to win it, the people of
                            Viet-Nam, against the Communists.</p>
                        <p>We are prepared to continue to assist them, but I don't think that the
                            war can be won unless the people support the effort and, in my opinion,
                            in the last 2 months, the government has gotten out of touch with the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>The repressions against the Buddhists, we felt, were very unwise. Now all
                            we can do is to make it very clear that we don't think this is the way
                            to win. It is my hope that this will become increasingly obvious to the
                            government, that they will take steps to try to bring back popular
                            support for this very essential struggle.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cronkite. Do you think this government still has time to regain the
                            support of the people?</p>
                        <p>The President. I do. With changes in policy and perhaps with personnel I
                            think it can. If it doesn't make those changes, I would think that the
                            chances of winning it would not be very good.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cronkite. Hasn't every indication from Saigon been that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has no intention of
                            changing his pattern?</p>
                        <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0120"/>
                        <p>The President. If he does not change it, of course, that is his decision.
                            He has been there 10 years and, as I say, he has carried this burden
                            when he has been counted out on a number of occasions.</p>
                        <p>Our best judgment is that he can't be successful on this basis. We hope
                            that he comes to see that, but in the final analysis it is the people
                            and the government itself who have to win or lose this struggle. All we
                            can do is help, and we are making it very clear, but I don't agree with
                            those who say we should withdraw. That would be a great mistake. I know
                            people don't like Americans to be engaged in this kind of an effort.
                            Forty-seven Americans have been killed in combat with the enemy, but
                            this is a very important struggle even though it is far away.</p>
                        <p>We took all this—made this effort to defend Europe. Now Europe is quite
                            secure. We also have to participate—we may not like it—in the defense of
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cronkite. Mr. President, have you made an assessment as to what
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was up to in
                            his statement on Viet-Nam last week?<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">See <ref target="#d26fn7">footnote 7, Document 26</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President. No. I guess it was an expression of his general view, but
                            he doesn't have any forces there or any program of economic assistance,
                            so that while these expressions are welcome, the burden is carried, as
                            it usually is, by the United States and the people there. But I think
                            anything General de Gaulle says should be listened to, and we
                            listened.</p>
                        <p>What, of course, makes Americans somewhat impatient is that after
                            carrying this load for 18 years, we are glad to get counsel, but we
                            would like a little more assistance, real assistance. But we are going
                            to meet our responsibility anyway.</p>
                        <p>It doesn't do us any good to say, “Well, why don't we all just go home
                            and leave the world to those who are our enemies.”</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is not our
                            enemy. He is our friend and candid friend—and, there, sometimes
                            difficulty—but he is not the object of our hostility.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cronkite. Mr. President, the sending of <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Henry Cabot Lodge</persName>, who after all has been a political
                            enemy of yours over the years at one point or another in your career,
                            and his—sending him out to Saigon might raise some speculation that
                            perhaps you are trying to keep this from being a political issue in
                            1964.</p>
                        <p>The President. No. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> wanted to go out to Saigon. If he were as careful
                            as some politicians are, of course, he would not have wanted to go
                            there. He would have maybe liked to have some safe job. But he is
                            energetic and he has strong feelings about the United States and,
                            surprisingly as it seems, he put this ahead of his political career.
                            Sometimes politicians do those things, Walter.</p>

                            and suggestion by those to whom it is being circulated. By early evening
                            I should have from Forrestal reactions of <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, and I will call you
                            then. </p>
                        <p>2. The urgency of this message is only in the desire which <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and I feel particularly to
                            get dialogue with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> started.
                            If you prefer to review this instruction in presence of your principal
                            advisers, we only lose one day by waiting until tomorrow. <persName corresp="#p_CLGMS1">Carter</persName> of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has strongly recommended this delay, and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName> inclines to agree.<note n="2" xml:id="d51fn2">

                                September 2,1:12 p.m., as follows: “The Sec. said that <persName corresp="#p_CLGMS1">Pat Carter</persName> had urged no hasty
                                action on reply to 403 from Saigon. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said he had gotten the word also and had
                                passed it along to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> did not favor hasty
                                action. They were in the process of working on a draft to pouch to
                                the Pres. The idea was to get the draft to the Pres., the Sec, the
                                other Principals and then see where we go from there. The Sec. said
                                to remove some of our people would be very dangerous.” (Department

                            he has been very skeptical of last week's line of action and would
                            probably incline to a line substantially softer than this message. </p>

                        <p>For Ambassador Lodge. Re your 403.</p>
                        <p>1. Results your talk with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            promising on surface but we fear stalling tactics especially in light of
                                [<hi rend="italic">document number not declassified</hi>].<note n="5" xml:id="d51fn5">
                                <ref target="#d46">Document 46</ref>.</note> Thus <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> [in?] Dalat could still be power
                            behind throne; Mme. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s tour
                            could be plus for her local prestige unless she stays away a long time;
                            dealings with Buddhists depend on concrete action not expression of
                            intent; broadening of Cabinet may or may not be real. In short,
                            everything depends on evident cut in personal authority of Nhus.</p>
                        <p>2. In this situation feeling here is that it is essential that central
                            negotiations should be conducted directly with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and that you should proceed to a
                            first meeting as soon as possible. Bargain with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would only confirm his
                            ascendancy.</p>
                        <p>3. You should react strongly against any bargain on removal of U.S.
                            agents or stopping of American radio attack on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. We are not offending party in this case and must not
                            be put on defensive. This does not preclude later adjustments if we get
                            a solid bargain.</p>
                        <p>4. You will have President's broadcast comment separately.<note n="6" xml:id="d51fn6">Reference is to telegram 319 to Saigon, in which the

                            President has carefully understated degree of his concern in order to
                            make needed improvements easier.</p>
                        <p>5. Subject to these specific comments, the following is guidance for your

                            repression which has eroded effort toward common goal of winning war
                            until there are concrete results in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            policies and posture. U.S. not trying to overthrow government, but
                            engaged in candid and critical talks to improve it. Purpose of general
                            posture is to give you <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0123"/>leverage
                            with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>; avoid false impression U.S.
                            tried something and now backing off; and to avoid seeming to acquiesce
                            in repression, which would put U.S. on wrong side fence with majority of
                            people inside Vietnam and the world.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Final reports of military operations in Vietnam for the month of August
                            indicate favorable trends in all military activities, despite Saigon's
                            preoccupation with the unstable political situation. During the month of
                            August, the Government forces conducted 166 large operations <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0125"/>(battalion equivalents or more), a
                            figure which compares most favorably with the 168 large operations
                            conducted in July-the month which set new highs, as the execution phase
                            of the National Military Campaign was begun. Although the number of
                            regular combat battalions committed was somewhat reduced, ranger, civil
                            guard, and self defense corps units were used extensively to maintain
                            the operational tempo. Small unit actions show an increase from 10,240
                            in July to 15,480 in August. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> attributes much of this apparent increase to
                            better reporting procedures.</p>
                        <p>Of particular interest are increases in the last week (28 August-4
                            September). There were 56 large and 3211 small unit government
                            operations in progress, as compared to 49 large and 3146 small unit
                            operations for the previous week. This increase in tempo is somewhat
                            offset by a reduction in friendly casualties to 308, which is the lowest
                            figure for this category for July and August.</p>
                        <p>Viet Cong activity for the past week was at the highest level since July
                            with a total of 391 incidents of all types. This increase in activity
                            was not without cost, for Viet Cong casualties also rose to 567,
                            continuing a three-week rising trend. The Viet Cong can be expected to
                            continue a high level of activity in an attempt to create as much
                            confusion and lack of faith in the government as possible.</p>
                        <p>Finally, as of 2 September, progress continues with the strategic hamlet
                            program. The latest Government of Vietnam figures indicate that 8,227 of
                            the 10,592 planned hamlets had been completed. 76 per cent, or 9,563,370
                            of the rural population, are now in these hamlets.</p>

                        <p>The President asked what the French are doing toward assisting the
                            Vietnamese. He was handed a paper on French economic and military
                            programs in Vietnam.<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">Not found.</note> He
                            commented that the French were doing practically nothing and their
                            program had been minimal in the last ten years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> added that the French
                            were doing very little in Laos. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> said their program there involved
                            approximately $9 million.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that the French were trying to get for Vietnam
                            what had been done in Laos, i.e. neutralization. He pointed out that
                            neutralization was not working in Laos and he wondered why <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Walter Lippmann</persName> had suggested that the
                            Laotian case provided an illustration of what should be done in Vietnam.
                            As to whether the French would protest the recent statement<note n="3" xml:id="d52fn3">
                                <ref target="#d50">Document 50</ref>.</note> he had made about

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested that the
                            President look at the draft instructions to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> (copy attached).<note n="5" xml:id="d54fn5">Not attached to the source text. A draft telegram
                                was attached to <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName>'s
                                memorandum for the record. With the exception of the last two
                                paragraphs (see <ref target="#d54fn10">footnote 10</ref> below) the
                                draft cable attached to <ref target="#d51">Document 51</ref> was
                                almost identical to the draft under discussion at this meeting. For
                                the cable as sent, see <ref target="#d56">Document 56</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President requested any information on a report<note n="6" xml:id="d54fn6">Not found.</note> concerning the defection of three
                            Viet Cong battalions. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that this report involved units in Laos.
                            not Vietnam. Mr. McCone cast <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0127"/>doubt on the entire report which had been repeated by <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> in his statement to our
                                officials.<note n="7" xml:id="d54fn7">See <ref target="#d44">Document 44</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President asked whether sending <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to Dalat would mean an improvement in the situation
                            in Saigon. Several members agreed that it would be an improvement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the
                            resignation of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would be
                            helpful for U.S. public opinion and world opinion. If Nhu were
                            physically absent from Saigon, this would also be an asset.</p>
                        <p>In the light of these comments, the President asked that the first
                            paragraph of the <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            instructions be rewritten. He did not think we should be so negative as
                            the draft.<note n="8" xml:id="d54fn8">In <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName>'s record, the President's remarks are
                                recorded in more detail. It reads as follows: “The President stated,
                                with respect to paragraph 1, that it is too negative; that it should
                                be rewritten to exhibit that visible removal of the Nhus from the
                                Saigon scene is some improvement, and to make sure that there is a
                                requirement for some actual substance in the reduction of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s power.”</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> responded that the instructions
                            represented our opening bid to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. He expected that they would end up somewhere in
                            the middle.</p>
                        <p>The President felt that there might be some substance to the proposals
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> made to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. He did not think we
                            ought to discourage the travel abroad of <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>, but he did not want her to come to the U.S.,
                            and above all, did not want her to make a speech in Washington. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> added that he thought
                            a trip by <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> was a good
                            idea. He believed we could handle the press in such a way that the trip
                            would not increase <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>'s
                            prestige.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether we should negotiate with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, but expressed his view that we should negotiate
                            with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, as the instructions
                            indicated. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> agreed
                            that negotiations should be conducted directly with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that paragraph 2 be revised to indicate that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> should resume
                            frequent meetings with Minister of Defense <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            on military matters as soon as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> had met with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph 3 dealing with how to react to any suggestions to remove
                            individual Americans or to stop what are alleged to be American radio
                            attacks on the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime was
                            deleted after Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            and Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> expressed
                            their doubt as to whether Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> should discuss these matters at all. It was
                            decided that the paragraph was not necessary in the light of the
                            President's public statement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> pointed out that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> may insist that certain
                            U.S. officials be removed from Vietnam. He said that if the Vietnamese
                            know what we know they would undoubtedly want certain officials to <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0128"/>leave. He suggested that we
                            leave the personnel question open but keep in the question of U.S. radio
                            attacks. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>
                            thought that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s complaints
                            about U.S. radio attacks referred not to the Voice of America but to
                            certain armed forces radio programs heard in the area.</p>
                        <p>At the President's suggestion, paragraph 4 is to be rewritten to make
                            clear that the President's broadcast was an effort to express his views
                            on the situation in Vietnam and was not a personal attack on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> commented that the President's
                            words would not be provocative to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> because he would understand why the President was
                            required to comment on the Vietnamese situation. It was agreed that the
                            entire CBS transcript, part of which was not broadcast, would be sent to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph 5 was revised in ways which are apparent in comparing the draft
                            with the final text (attached).<note n="9" xml:id="d54fn9">In <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName>'s record, he describes
                                these revisions as follows: “5. Respecting paragraph 5a of the
                                attached draft, the President did not desire to use the expression
                                'keep up tension' end directed that it be replaced by the phrase 'we
                                will continue to assert, publicly and privately, U.S. discontent'.
                                In connection with paragraph 5b, the President was desirous of
                                ensuring that the second phrase read 'difficulty in continuing
                                support of American people'.” The President commented that <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName>, the New York Times
                                reporter in Saigon, was not an accurate reporter. He noted that the
                                Bonzes went to our Ambassador in search of protection. Hence, the
                                Buddhists were not anti-U.S.<note n="10" xml:id="d54fn10">

                                    rest of the discussion at the meeting reads as follows: <p>“6.
                                        Following further discussion and minor editorial alteration
                                        of the draft, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> proposed the addition of two
                                        paragraphs, shown on the attached as paragraphs 6 and 7. The
                                        President decided to omit paragraph 7 and have paragraph 6
                                        sent as a separate message in light of its greater
                                        sensitivity. He stated that its thrust should be in terms of
                                        saying that the generals should be in contact with us,
                                        rather than we with them, in the event that they desire
                                        action; that, on the basis that the generals are not acting,
                                        we are now making a diplomatic effort. He was anxious to
                                        make it plain that it was the generals and not we who backed
                                        off.”</p>

                        <p>A draft of an additional paragraph was circulated. It involved military

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> pointed out that we
                            had already had two contacts with Vietnamese generals. One would lead to
                            a further discussion, and the other was a rejection, in effect, of
                            further contact. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            said these contacts indicated there was less support than we had thought
                            there would be.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked why we
                            should try to unscramble the confused situation among the generals in
                            Vietnam. He thought we ought to keep Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> out of touch with the
                            generals.</p>
                        <p>The President decided that we should wait for the generals to contact us.
                            Meanwhile, we assume that they are not acting and that we are going down
                            a diplomatic route. When they come to us we will talk to them. We should
                            avoid letting the generals think that the U.S. had backed off.</p>
                        <p>As the meeting ended, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> agreed that no action need be taken in connection
                            with current instructions to our military forces. Fleet movements would
                            continue in view of the fact that such action created no problems for
                            us. Ships on station would remain in place. Proposed redeployment of
                            aircraft would be stood down, however.</p>

                            case of pure and careful deduction. The President said he would not want
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> carrying the story. Mr M said he
                            had spoken with Ed<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3">

                            Mr M said he did not think anyone had been talking out of turn; he
                            himself had been the only one, he believed to talk with Hightower since
                            the President's statement and he remembered what he had told him. Mr M
                            said that we had made a strong statement last week and when we pointed
                            the finger, any good correspondent would be bound to draw some
                            conclusions and get the idea that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is the one we do not like. The President said we do
                            not think we can get him completely out of the picture. Mr M said there
                            was a problem in saying that too. Mr. M said he had made clear to
                            Hightower that we could not tell the Vietnamese Government what to do
                            and who to choose. Mr M said he felt Hightower had a good grip on
                            things.</p>

                            decision to withdraw which had not been made. The President said he
                            thought it would be good if we could turn these stories off for a few
                            days, and not have people going on TV. Mr M mentioned that Mr <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> had been turning down press

                        <p>In this situation feeling here is that it is essential that central

                            has expressed his views because of his concern for the success of the
                            war effort and his hope that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            will recognize the need for changes in their policy and improvements in
                            their government.</p>
                        <p>Subject to these specific comments, the following is guidance for your
                            first conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">General Posture</hi>: We will continue to assert
                            publicly and privately US discontent with repression which has eroded
                            effort toward common goal of winning war until there are concrete
                            results in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policies and posture. US
                            not trying to overthrow government, but engaged in candid and critical
                            talks to improve it. Purpose of general posture is to give you leverage
                            with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>; avoid false public impression
                            US tried something and now backing off; and to avoid seeming to
                            acquiesce in repression, which would put US on wrong side fence with
                            majority of people inside Viet-Nam and the world.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. If I correctly understand instructions, they are based on a very
                            different reading of the situation here and the possibilities than my
                            own and my colleagues. Reftel states that “everything depends on there
                            being real substance in <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s
                            various proposals and change in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            policies and actions.” In fact, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s proposals, insofar as they related to what he is
                            offering us, have very little substance, and I did not mean to suggest
                            in my 403<note n="3" xml:id="d58fn3">
                                <ref target="#d44">Document 44</ref>.</note> that they did have,
                            they are largely scenery. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is
                            certainly not contemplating a change in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policies and actions. On contrary, he feels in a
                            stronger position than ever before domestically and he no doubt feels
                            reassured from President's excellent TV conference that we are not
                            planning to pull out, which has surely been his assumption right
                            along.</p>
                        <p>2. Our leverage is therefore very slight, and the question whether
                            Washington would like to see an agreement between US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> along lines of my 403, in an effort to
                            clear the air and then get on with the war (and wait for appearance of
                            individual or group with iron and will to take over government). If
                            answer is in the affirmative, then I would propose to proceed as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Believe it would be unwise to talk to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> until we have reacted to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s offer. Do not think this would
                            give <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> any greater ascendancy
                            than he has already. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s
                            so-called retirement and <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame
                                Nhu</persName>'s departure can only be worked out directly through
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>b. Meeting to be held with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                                [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>]. Aim at this
                            meeting would be to spell out details of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s change of status; length of time of <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>'s absence. I assume three
                            months would have value to us in broadening of Cabinet membership;
                            release of students and bonzes still in prison; and repair of pagodas.
                            Am advised [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 1ine not declassified</hi>]
                            that repeal of Decree Law No. 10 is no longer relevant. However, it
                            would no doubt have value in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and I
                            would try for this too. Release of bonzes in Embassy not yet requested.
                            When it is asked for, we can stipulate safety guarantee.</p>
                        <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0134"/>
                        <p>Possibly best solution would be for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            to agree Quang can leave country. As for negotiating outstanding issues
                            with “true Buddhist leadership,” this is out of the question if we mean
                            pre-May 21 leadership.</p>
                        <p>c. Once these matters are settled with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, I would see <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, as a gesture of ratification.</p>
                        <p>d. If I see <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> now with all of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s proposals hanging fire,
                            I will get nothing but a two-hour filibuster and a mouthful of
                            generalities and run risk of losing whatever progress has been made.</p>
                        <p>e. President's broadcast is excellent in underscoring serious view we
                            take of situation. I have already at great length dwelt on the
                            importance of improving <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> posture and
                            will do so again.</p>
                        <p>3. If something like this is not satisfactory and we must have a change
                            in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policies and actions, then we
                            must have leverage. Nothing better has occurred to me on this score than
                            previous suggestion of arranging for House or House Committee to cut our
                            aid for Vietnam. I could then demand concessions on ground they
                            necessary to get Congressional action reversed.</p>
                        <p>4. Other devices may occur to Washington, but we must be clear as to our
                            objectives. I regret that none of alternatives is inviting. Do not want
                            to bother you with details, but the question of whether we will be
                            satisfied with agreement on points in my 403 or whether we insist on
                            far-reaching policy changes (which cannot be had with existing leverage)
                            is so fundamental that I ask guidance.</p>

                        <p>1. Re your paragraph 4, President's interview<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3">

                            of U.S. policy, i.e., to secure a victory in war against Viet Cong. It
                            is in that context that he expressed our sense of need for change in
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policies and perhaps in
                            personnel so as to regain touch with people.</p>

                        <p>2. Re your paragraph 3, we recognize that you are entering into difficult
                            negotiations and must be the first judge of what you can or cannot
                            achieve in the light of the leverage which you have. Believe you will
                            have clearer picture of what is possible after your first talks with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and we will then be in better
                            position evaluate results and decide whether we can provide you with
                            more powerful negotiating tools.</p>
                        <p>3. You are best judge of whether it is wiser to talk to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> first on question of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s offer to resign and we accept your advice on this
                            point. However suggest you save other policy issues for talks with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. Believe it important
                            to get both talks started as soon as you can.</p>
                        <p>4. Do not really believe we have different readings of the situation. Our
                            previous exchanges of telegrams should give you idea of what we believe
                            would be optimum outcome of your talks. Goal is that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> have political support at home and
                            abroad indispensable to winning war. In opening negotiations you should
                            press for maximum steps in this direction, along lines generally agreed
                            in our preceding exchanges. We do not believe we should set minimum
                            terms at this stage, but should await further report on your
                            negotiations.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Agree your paragraph 1 on great desirability of “change in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policies.” There may be an off-chance I
                            might in time get in a position to give them advice, some of which they
                            would take. But this is clearly impossible in the present
                            atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>2. Re your paragraph 2 as to “what I can or cannot achieve”, the main
                            leverage I have is the build-up given me by the President's personal
                                letter<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">See <ref target="frus1961-63v03">Foreign Relations, 1961-1963, vol. III</ref>, p. 644, footnote
                                2.</note> which has inspired some hope in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that I will <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0136"/>some day speak well of them to U.S. public. They, therefore, may be
                            willing to do something to impel me to do so. I am using this leverage
                            to the utmost as well as President's expressions of disapproval.</p>
                        <p>3. But I do not believe their word is good; <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s resignation surely would mean very little;
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>'s departure is
                            obviously intended to be a triumphant lecture tour; the broadening of
                            the membership of the government will realistically change nothing; and
                            the placating of the Buddhists, as far as <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is concerned, is largely done. If these things have no
                            usefulness in the U.S. as gestures, they are probably not worth doing.
                            It would be better to keep them worried than to agree to some gestures
                            which we regard as essentially meaningless but which would give them the
                            feeling that they are forgiven.</p>
                        <p>4. Rather than go myself, I intend to get [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                1ine not declassified</hi>] to tell <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> that we are really not interested in his package;
                            that is, his resignation, <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame
                                Nhu</persName>'s lecture tour, etc., and see if they can get
                            something better. If they get something better, I can then go back.</p>
                        <p>5. If [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 1ine not declassified</hi>] produce
                            nothing substantial, I would then see <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and request the departure of both Nhus, the
                            broadening of the composition of the government, the placating of the
                            Buddhists, etc. Believe this will be for the record only but, of course,
                            will try.</p>
                        <p>6. As to “political support at home and abroad” in your paragraph 4, I do
                            not believe the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> really understands
                            this at all. They are essentially a medieval, Oriental despotism of the
                            classic family type, who understand few, if any, of the arts of popular
                            government. They cannot talk to the people; they cannot cultivate the
                            press; they cannot delegate authority or inspire trust; they cannot
                            comprehend the idea of government as the servant of the people. They are
                            interested in physical security and survival against any threat
                            whatsoever—Communist or non-Communist.</p>
                        <p>7. Of course, I will always keep trying, hoping this estimate may be
                            wrong and that there may be changes of one kind or another.</p>
                        <p>8. We are also studying possibilities of selective cutbacks or controls
                            on aid components. Separate telegram will follow on this.<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">Not found. In telegram 337 to Saigon, September 5,

                        <p>The President: Hello, Roger. Who puts this stuff out in Washington?
                            There's an article in The New York Times by Tad Schultz [<hi rend="italic">Szulc</hi>], page 5, in which he says that officials
                            say that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is trying to
                            blackmail us.<note n="2" xml:id="d61fn2">In this New York Times article
                                entitled, “Washington Officials Accuse <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> of Blackmail,” September 5, Szulc stated that
                                administration officials believed <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s attempts at political blackmail were bound to

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>: I've given strict
                            orders to everyone in <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> not to talk to

                            might have said anything. If no one is telling Schulz this stuff then
                            somebody ought to call the NY Times. If nobody there—you or <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Manning</persName> or Gov. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>—has said anything then no one
                            with the authority could have said this.</p>

                            nobody qualified to make such a statement could have given him this kind

                        <p>On September 5, 1963, President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> sent United Nations Secretary-General U Thant a
                            letter responding to an appeal by U Thant on August 31. On behalf of
                            Asian and African member states, U Thant expressed grave concern over
                            the situation in the Republic of Vietnam. The Secretary-General added
                            his own “personal appeal” to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> “to find a solution to the questions which are so
                            deeply affecting the population of your country.” <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s response denied that there was
                            suppression of Buddhism in the Republic of Vietnam, charged that such an
                            allegation was “an imperialist invention,” and stated that the African
                            and Asian members of the United Nations were “allowing themselves to be
                            poisoned by an international conspiracy of the East or West against the
                            Republic of Viet-Nam.” <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            stated that Vietnam was upholding public order, freeing the Buddhist
                            hierarchy of outside influence, and had already found a solution to the
                            Buddhist question. U Thant's letter of August 31 is printed in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents</hi>, 1963,
                            pages 869-870. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s letter of

                            two-hour executive session today with Far East Subcommittee of Senate
                            Foreign Relations Committee revealed far-reaching doubts regarding not
                            only <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> leadership but also advisability of
                            continued US participation in Viet-Nam war. Subcommittee mood augurs
                            heavy sledding in upcoming Senate aid debate as well as probable
                            introduction of resolution condemning further US support for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>; e.g. “It is the sense of the Senate
                            that the American people are no longer willing to support a regime in
                            South Viet-Nam that oppresses the people and religious sects. Continued
                            support of such a regime is inconsistent with the basic precepts of
                            American democracy.”</p>
                        <p>Major themes of Senatorial concern today were: “disaster course” of
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> leadership; dangers in Viet-Nam and
                            elsewhere of US identification with repressive regime; press reports of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> contacts with Hanoi;
                            failure of US to produce alternative to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>; absence

                        <p>Dear Mr. Undersecretary: When we met two years ago you suggested kindly
                            that I may send you a private message whenever I have something to say
                            about the situation in my country: Vietnam. I am now taking advantage of
                            this permission because while I am now in Africa, deeply involved in the
                            development problems of this part of the world, I cannot refrain from
                            being anguished by the late events in my own country.</p>
                        <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0141"/>
                        <p>Two years ago I told you that any political improvement must come from
                            the people and that political change must be the responsibility of the
                            Vietnamese themselves. I did not agree with those who claimed to be
                            Vietnamese political leaders and were only expecting changes worked out
                            by foreign influence.</p>
                        <p>Now I am pleading that the US does its utmost to prevent the further
                            crushing of the Buddhist movement and the subsequent political protest
                            which has developed out of general discontentment and of M. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and family's handling of the
                            religious crisis.</p>
                        <p>I am advocating a strong stand from the US not only for the sake of those
                            directly threatened by <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s
                            repression, but also for the sake of preserving the Southern part of
                            Vietnam as a place where one day a true regime of freedom of thought
                            could seed and develop.</p>
                        <p>Without a US clear cut condemnation of M. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s recent sacking of temples, it will be impossible
                            for any future Vietnamese Government to be able to gain popular support
                            while siding with the West. Yet our chance of survival depends from the
                            conciliation of these two conditions.</p>
                        <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and his family must go
                            now, even if there is no ready made alternative, even if the change
                            involves important risks; those risks must be taken for M. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has become the worst alternative,
                            the only one leading to fatal communist takeover.</p>
                        <p>Even those most attached to freedom like myself cannot accept the idea of
                            the continuation of M. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s
                            rule for the sake of preserving our country from falling into communist
                            hands.</p>
                        <p>It is time now for the US to side with the people of Vietnam in its
                            struggle to free itself from dictatorship. Time is now working for the
                            communists, action has to be taken quickly. I am convinced that the
                            Vietnamese people is ready to fight for Independence and Freedom, it
                            will never fight for anti-communism as such.</p>
                        <p>This letter is not inspired by any political ambition, it is not
                            motivated by any partisan consideration. I am now in International
                            Service and intend to remain so. If I raise my voice now it is because
                            as a simple Vietnamese I feel compelled to do so; the recent events in
                            Vietnam is [<hi rend="italic">are</hi>] as shocking as the crushing of
                            the Hungarian revolt.</p>

                        <p>The President telephoned and asked what the news was.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said we did not have a
                            telegram in yet.</p>
                        <p>The President mentioned the newspaper stories attributed to one of our
                            wonderful sources there. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that we had gotten the ticker last night
                            and had sent a blast to Saigon.<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">Not
                                found.</note> The President said this strips us kind of bare. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said this makes him
                            so damned mad. He had warned them about talking. The President said you
                            can't stop people from doing that. We have the same problem here.</p>
                        <p>The President said we now should have some sort of economic
                            program-things we could do that would not have material effect
                            immediately but which would give them the word. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said he had started looking
                            into the various possibilities a week ago. In reply to the President's
                            question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said there
                            was not too much. The President asked what about tying aid to U.S.
                            purchases. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said this
                            was an idea; that we tie some in anyway. The President asked what the
                            dollar loss was to Viet-Nam. He said we ought to do that anyway.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>
                            had <persName corresp="#p_JSJ1">Janow</persName> or someone working on
                            it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_JSJ1">Janow</persName> and Bob Barnett and the economic
                            people here were working on it already. The President said he would like
                            to have some ideas this morning.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that if the
                            situation continues to deteriorate in Vietnam, if our relations with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> continue to
                            deteriorate, and if U.S. domestic opinion becomes strongly
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, we will be faced
                            with no alternative short of a massive U.S. military effort. We should
                            direct Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> to tell
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>:</p>
                        <p>1. That we can foresee a condemnatory resolution in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> within the next ten days. We will not be
                            in the position to keep this anti-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> resolution from being passed. <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>'s appearance at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be disastrous.</p>
                        <p>2. Unless <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> acts promptly,
                            there will be a drastic effect in the U.S involving both reduction in
                            economic and military assistance and strong pressure to withdraw U.S
                            political support of Vietnam. He noted that we have not yet used the
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> channel. Our urgent task is to
                            gather all the evidence we can on the situation in Vietnam and the
                            effect of recent events on the military effort against the Viet
                            Cong.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested that
                            we direct General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to see
                            Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> and get
                            his current views. He may no longer be saying, as he was last week, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has to go. We also need a
                            military evaluation of what is happening in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> suggested that
                            we ask Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> to see
                            Vice President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> who will have
                            an excellent feel for what effect the recent events have had on the
                            Vietnamese military effort.</p>
                        <p>There followed a discussion of a statement appearing in the press
                            allegedly quoting General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> as saying that recent events had reduced by 50%
                            the Vietnamese military effort.<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2">A copy of the

                            effort had been affected but not seriously. An effort was being made to
                            find out whether General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            had been misquoted. (It later developed that the reporter had
                            misrepresented General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>'
                            view which continued to be that the effect on the anti-Viet Cong
                            operations had been limited.)</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General asked whether we could win the war with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that the answer was no, if the Nhus
                            remained in power and continued along the same lines they have been
                            following. However, the Nhus may change their line.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General asked whether the Nhus would change now. He cited
                            press stories saying that we can live with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.
                            Such stories are certainly read by <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. The effect is to greatly reduce our bargaining
                            power with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. We have to be
                            tough. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> has to
                            do more than say our President is unhappy. We have to tell <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that he must do the things we
                            demand or we will have to cut down our effort as forced by the U.S.
                            public.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said he had already
                            sent a cable asking Embassy Saigon how we could cut U.S. programs
                            without hurting the war effort.<note n="3" xml:id="d66fn3">Telegram 313

                        </p>
                        <p>The Attorney General asked if we have concluded that we are going to lose
                            with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, why do we not grasp
                            the nettle now.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> pointed out that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would not be relying on
                            press reports for information as to U.S. views. Our actions should be
                            taken in two or three bites. It is very serious to threaten to pull out
                            of Vietnam. If the Viet Cong takes over in Vietnam we are in real
                            trouble. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> could
                            discount press stories by talking about what has to be done to meet our
                            demands, including the exile of <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame
                                Nhu</persName>. On the basis of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s talk with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, we could then decide on our next
                            move. At that time we might decide to issue an ultimatum.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> agreed that this was not the moment of
                            decision. When we say we can't win with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> we are talking of a longer time period. He
                            personally doubted that General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> had said that the war effort had fallen off by
                            50%. He thought we should find out what was on <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>'s mind.</p>
                        <p>He recalled that <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>'s view
                            that something must be done immediately if the war was to be won had
                            triggered our action of last week end. He thought we should find out
                            whether <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>'s view had
                            changed during the past few days and in the light of the collapse of
                            coup planning.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> recalled that
                            three weeks ago we still believed that we could win the war with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. The Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff shared that view. He asked whether recent events had changed our
                            judgment.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General again asked what we should do if we have concluded
                            that we can't win with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that
                            we can't answer that question because we have insufficient information
                            in Washington.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed that a
                            reassessment was required. He then read a cable from Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> reporting most recent
                            developments (attached).<note n="4" xml:id="d66fn4">No cable was

                            now but a discussion of the current situation.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General asked whether we could get the views promptly of
                            U.S. officers working with Vietnamese military units. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we could ask
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to do this
                            today. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said we
                            could get the grass roots military view and suggested that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> go to Vietnam,
                            returning the first of the week, to report on the views of the
                            Vietnamese officers.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> commented on a
                            report by <persName corresp="#p_HM1">Marguerite Higgins</persName> who
                            had visited the Vietnamese countryside. He thought that Saigon may be
                            such a snake pit that the views of those in Saigon may not be
                            representative. He felt a strong need to try and find out the realities
                            of the situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> said he could ask his
                            station chief to find out the views of the 23 Vietnamese on the <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> payroll.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that his son
                            had received a personal letter from a junior Foreign Service Officer
                            friend now in Vietnam reporting real promise in the war against the
                            Vietcong.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> recommended
                            that General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> go to
                            Saigon and return Monday.<note n="5" xml:id="d66fn5">September 9.</note>
                            He asked that we get views from British Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1">Thompson</persName> who is in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said the crucial question is what are the
                            components of a judgment as to whether we can win the war with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said we can live
                            with the international aspects of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government, but can we win in Vietnam? Can we
                            contain criticism in the U.S.? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> asked that we do not underestimate the harm being
                            done to us internationally by our continued support of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that if we win in Vietnam,
                            the international aspect will come into line.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the instructions to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said we should make clear that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s first substantive meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> should not be
                            considered a showdown.</p>
                        <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0146"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> urged that we
                            do not use pressure on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. To
                            do so, in his opinion, would produce an unfortunate reaction. He asked
                            that we do not talk to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            about sanctions, but describe to him flatly the situation as we saw
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> described our
                            present position as being stage one. There may be no stage two if we
                            decide to pull out. If we pull out, we might tell <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that we wish him well. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> may be able to win the war
                            without us, but this is unlikely. Prior to actually pulling out, we
                            might want to consider promoting a coup.</p>
                        <p>The President entered the meeting at this point. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> summarized the earlier discussion
                            and the draft instructions to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President<note n="6" xml:id="d66fn6">For additional remarks by the
                                President, see <ref target="#d67">Document 67.</ref>
                            </note> asked why our goal is to get <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> out for six months. Is this realistic? <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> should go abroad but somehow
                            she should be kept from making speeches.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> asked what is the essential minimum of our
                            demands. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied
                            that if the Nhus stay on their present course we will continue to lose
                            ground.</p>
                        <p>The President said we should ask <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to prohibit <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame
                                Nhu</persName> from talking. We had a public relations task in the
                            U.S. and worldwide in dealing with <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame
                                Nhu</persName>. He asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> whether our minimum requirement was the removal
                            of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that on
                            balance he felt that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would
                            have to go. He believed that the departure of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would mean a loss in Vietnam but a
                            gain with U.S. public opinion. He acknowledged the choice was a very
                            close one.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said that if <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> would leave we could live with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> remaining in Saigon. He asked again
                            that we try to find out from <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> whether he believes as he did two weeks ago that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> must go if the war is to
                            be won.</p>

                        <p>At the end of the 10:30 meeting on September 6, 1963 (see <ref target="#d66">Document 66</ref>), the President made the following
                            additional remarks (see <ref target="#d66fn6">footnote 6,
                            Document 66</ref>):</p>
                        <p>“The discussion then turned to the instructions to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>.</p>
                        <p>“The President asked if it was realistic to demand that brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> should go out. We certainly should
                            insist on <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> shutting up,
                            if only for the public relations problem here in this country.</p>
                        <p>“As to brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, the President
                            asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> if he would be
                            for his going if we could get him to go. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that as far as the
                            problem here in the US is concerned he was sure that it would be better
                            to have brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> leave.
                            Internally within Viet-Nam he was not at all sure that it would be good
                            to have him go.</p>
                        <p>“The President said that this should be one of the major purposes of the
                            reassessment that we are undertaking. The President asked what sanctions
                            we should give <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> in
                            connection with aid. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>
                            resorted on his appearance before the Senate and the use that <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> had made of this in Saigon
                                (<gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 335 and Saigon's
                            431).</p>
                        <p>“Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that if
                            we want to come out with our marbles we must not present <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> an ultimatum. Even the strongest
                            sanctions would not work. It was OK, however, to talk of American public
                            opinion, Congress, etc.</p>
                        <p>“The Secretary of State said that <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>'s position was all right for the first stage
                            but, if we do pull out, we must tell <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in advance saying that we would still wish him
                            well. The point was that a pull-off might well make a military coup
                            probable.” (Memorandum of discussion by <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>, September 6; Kennedy Library, Hilsman Papers,

                            result of recent developments in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>1. The first report (TDCS DB-3/656,446) relates to an interview of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>'s brother, Tran Van
                            Khiem, on August 31 by Denis Warner, a reliable Australian
                            correspondent. Warner informed an American official that <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> showed him a list of United
                            States Embassy, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> personnel he was planning to assassinate. Warner
                            indicated that the assassination of Americans would result in the
                            landing of United States Marines within hours to which <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> replied that there are 20,000
                            Vietnamese troops in Saigon to meet this eventuality. However, <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> seemed impressed with Warner's
                            counter that a division of Marines would quickly wipe out any opposing
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>We do not think that the Vietnamese Government would at this time
                            sanction such acts against American officials. However, we can expect
                            that the current anti-American campaign as reflected in the
                            government-controlled press and in official statements will continue;
                            anti-American rallies or demonstrations are also possible. <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> is the brother of <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>, and his own father, the
                            former Vietnamese Ambassador to Washington, <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Tran Van Chuong</persName>, has denounced him as incompetent,
                            corrupted, and cowardly. The last we have heard of <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> was on August 11 when Secretary
                            of State for the Presidency Thuan informed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> had organized her own secret
                            police squad headed by <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>.
                            Thuan stated that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> himself was

                                which had as its central premise that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in conjunction with the Viet Cong spent millions of

                            attempt to inspire a coup. On September 5, the First Secretary of the

                                <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>, told an American

                            she had written most, if not all, of the article. She is reported to
                            have also stated that most of South Vietnam's troubles resulted from
                            false reporting by the American press and from American interference.
                            She even charged that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> was planning to have her removed or murdered. She
                            added that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was too weak and
                            was dependent upon her for support and strength to carry out the

                        <p>We have suspected that the <hi rend="italic">Times of Vietnam</hi>
                            article was written, or at least inspired, by the Nhus. Of course,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> is aware that we
                            want her to leave, and she probably feels she would be a main target in
                            any coup attempt against the regime. Her statement on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> recalls a similar public
                            statement of hers about a month ago and one which touched <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> on a very sensitive point.</p>

                        <p>3. We then discussed 2 Sept <hi rend="italic">Times of Vietnam</hi>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> alleged he had nothing
                            whatever to do with article and claims he had not even read it. Stated
                            that he did not hide himself behind backsides of a woman, in this
                            instance referring specifically to Mrs. Gregory. He surmised in passing
                            that Gregorys may have obtained some of their information from American
                            sources but did not emphasize this line. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> did not raise question of <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>'s role nor did he.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> stated he wished explicitly
                            authorize <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> and station to proceed
                            with all station programs of joint nature. Volunteered that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, he, <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LUONG1">Luong</persName> and others had approved these
                            programs. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> considers the

                            to claim, is his primary interest. Stating he had previously said he had
                            no political or power ambition he modified this to say he has primary
                            ambition after all, which he describes as winning counter-subversive war
                            because of its importance not only to South Vietnam but also because of
                            bearing counter-subversive <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0151"/>war

                            conversation, he again stressed his desire we continue joint programs.
                            Without <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> putting question to him,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> disclaimed any role in

                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> seems convinced some
                            Americans (unidentified) arranged sanctuary of three bonzes in American
                            Embassy. When <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> expressed complete
                            disbelief, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> admitted arrival
                            of three bonzes probably came as surprise to Embassy officials but
                            continued to claim <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in possession
                            telephone tap indicating that (unidentified) American had been behind
                            this episode. He did not elaborate on problem constituted by bonzes in
                            Embassy nor did <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> press him on this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> feels there are too many
                            American civilians in Saigon and that some of these personnel are
                            maintaining continual campaign of anti-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> criticism. Did not name them but expressed view that
                            this was matter for internal discipline of U.S. Mission, not for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> action. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> seems to think number of American civilians in
                            Saigon should be reduced and states he was asked at Interministerial
                            Committee on Strategic Hamlets meeting morning 6 Sept about presence
                            U.S. military advisors. Had answered question to effect that military
                            advisors should be increased where they were needed and effective and
                            decreased where contrary situation prevailed. Said nothing about any
                            reduction in military establishment.</p>
                        <p>7. With respect to negotiations with Hanoi, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said Italian Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DOG1">D'Orlandi</persName> and Indian High Commissioner Goburdhun had
                            asked him to see Polish <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> Commissioner
                                <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Maneli</persName> to find out “what was
                            in his stomach”. <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Maneli</persName> had made
                            several previous efforts to talk with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> but had not been received. As result of <persName corresp="#p_DOG1">D'Orlandi</persName> and Goburdhun's persuasion,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> received <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Maneli</persName> about three days ago. <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Maneli</persName> expressed view that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> should take advantage of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> declarations<note n="4" target="d69fn4">See <ref target="#d26fn7">footnote 7,

                            and to enter into negotiations with Hanoi. <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Maneli</persName> said he had been authorized by <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Pham Van Dong</persName> to act as intermediary.
                            He suggested to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> that <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> could sell rice and beer to North
                            Vietnam in return for coal. Volunteered to be at <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s services any hour of day or
                            night. <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Maneli</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> he was only man in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> who could dare to undertake such
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> claims he answered
                                <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Maneli</persName> to effect that, while
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s statement was
                            interesting, only combatants in this war had right to speak and act.
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is allied with U.S. and it would
                            be “immoral act” to explore such a problem unilaterally behind backs of
                            Americans. Commercial relations with North Vietnam would have inevitable
                            political repercussions on fighting morale and political clarity of
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> population. <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Maneli</persName> asked what was next step and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he replied “continue
                            building strategic hamlets”. To <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0152"/>has no secret channel to Hanoi but
                            could communicate through Goburdhun or <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Maneli</persName> if he wished. His contacts are with Viet Cong in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and his objective with them is
                            to win them over against North Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> stated he believes the guerrilla war would be
                            greatly advanced in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> favor by end of
                            1963 and that at some future time <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            and U.S. might be able negotiate with North Vietnam from position of
                            strength. He states he is adamantly opposed to neutralism, although
                                <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> had not brought up this subject.
                            Neutralism, according to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, is
                            completely contrary to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s outlook and
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>9. Without specifying, <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Maneli</persName> [told
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>?] Saigon <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would soon have four enemies against
                            it, presumably including U.S. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            says he answered <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Maneli</persName> with
                            comment that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> accustomed to being
                            attacked from many sides and would prefer go down with dignity than to
                            live on knees. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> told <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> that neither <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> nor any other government could possibly negotiate with
                            Hanoi either openly or secretly, except after having won guerrilla war
                            and not in terms of neutralization but rather within framework of strong
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> seeking to incorporate North
                            Vietnam within free world order.</p>
                        <p>10. On Buddhist question, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said
                            he had been off on vacation with family, 8 May and had not participated
                            immediately in crisis which exploded that date. Buddhist problem
                            advanced too far and too fast, reaching final point where surgery was
                            necessary to survival of government and conduct of war. Still claims he
                            had nothing to do with declaration of martial law or with attacks on
                            pagodas. Denies he manipulated Secret Police or <persName corresp="#p_LQTC1">Colonel Tung</persName>'s forces. When general
                            officers saw <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> evening 18
                            August to propose martial law, claims <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            what Generals wanted see him about at that hour and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> surmised to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that probably they wanted take up
                            question of new Chief of Staff. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> claims general officers informed him on 19 August of
                            their discussion with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.
                            During general officers/<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            meeting on 18 Aug, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> approved
                            martial law in principle, asked that bonzes not be harmed, and
                            recommended that military legal officer be present at pagodas to see
                            that military forces acted in accordance with law. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> claims military found this last
                            stipulation unrealistic and impractical. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said General Do Cao Tri had visited him about 19 or
                            20 August and initiated discussion on what General <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri</persName> intended to do during martial law.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri</persName> brought out notebook
                            indicating precise steps he intended take and persons he would arrest.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri</persName> said he had been planning for the
                            action over the past preceding month. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> stated to <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> that
                            he is “scapegoat” of entire affair, although said at same time that
                            situation had reached point where surgical action necessary. The [<hi rend="italic">He?</hi>1 says there was no <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0153"/>meeting of civilian leaders after

                            session of 18 Aug (contrary to Minister <persName corresp="#p_HIEU1">Hieu</persName>'s report (FVS 9513)).<note n="5" xml:id="d69fn5">Not found.</note>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that, apart from
                            surgical operation of 21 August, he has been for policy of conciliation
                            and continues to be now. He said this was another part of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s stipulations during his session
                            with Generals on 18 August, i.e., that martial law and removal of
                            Buddhists to home pagodas would not constitute breach of his policy of
                            conciliation.</p>
                        <p>11. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> asked <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> how long he thought martial law would last.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> answered that he had no
                            idea. He felt persistence of martial law was dangerous to government and
                            commented that martial law was having psychological effect on general
                            officers which he thought could become a serious problem. During today's
                            meeting of Interministerial Committee on Strategic Hamlets, general
                            officers had raised question of their participating in Cabinet positions
                            within government and problems relating to general style structure.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had answered them to
                            effect that Interministerial Committee was not proper forum nor did this
                            lie within his responsibility. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            impression is that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is in fact
                            worried about changes in general officers' outlook and increasing
                            demands from their side for participation in government.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> gave some time to
                            discussing how his children found life at Gia Long unpleasant and unlike
                            normal lives led by other children. They felt they did not have
                            playmates like other young people, could not walk down the street
                            normally, were surrounded by too many servants, and would much rather
                            live in villa somewhere in other part of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, like their villa at Dalat. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that he had to take this family problem
                            seriously because psychological wounds of this kind in childhood could
                            have lasting effects into adult life. (<gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> had impression, as result <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s emphasis on this subject, that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> might be laying ground work for his
                            temporary withdrawal.)</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s comments are contrary to
                            information we have received from other sources. See no point in trying
                            to elaborate on his sincerity or insincerity but do not exclude that
                            there are various substantial elements of deception involved in his
                            statements. This would not be unnatural in power and politics. He claims
                            to want to go forward with [as] U.S. ally and that he recognized fully
                            American contribution to winning guerrilla war. I had no impression from
                            this meeting that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was
                            inclined toward significant cutback in American presence of programs. He
                            again claimed he is not anti-American. Discussion was conducted on both
                            sides in friendly, dispassionate manner. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was looking well.</p>

                        <p>1. Following is result of highest level meeting today.<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">See <ref target="#d66">Document 66</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. It is clear that as a minimum we face a major problem with world, with
                            US Congress and with American public which will require <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to take actions to restore its image so
                            that we may continue to support it. These actions include effective
                            silencing and probably removal from country of <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>, releasing of bonzes,
                            students, etc., along lines we have discussed.</p>
                        <p>3. What is not clear is whether these measures will suffice to restore
                            sufficient confidence in the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government within Viet-Nam to permit them to win
                            the war.</p>
                        <p>4. Sense of meeting was that if the answer to this second question is
                            that additional measures, such as departure of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, are essential, and if we cannot
                            obtain these additional measures after negotiating with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, then US faced with question
                            whether to apply sanctions with all their risks rather than let
                            situation get steadily worse.</p>
                        <p>5. At present there are two missing ingredients necessary to make a
                            judgment. First is information on Vietnamese attitudes, and <gloss target="#t_SEPTEL1">septel</gloss>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">
                                <ref target="#d71">Document 71</ref>.</note> describes actions we
                            are taking this regard in addition to those you already have
                            underway.</p>
                        <p>6. The second missing ingredient is <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s attitude. You should initiate dialogue with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> soonest. Purpose of
                            this is not for showdown negotiations or ultimatum (since we not yet
                            decided on ultimate sanctions to be used) but rather to afford you and
                            us an opportunity to clarify present situation and assess future
                            moves—e.g., to express clearly and authoritatively considerations US
                            side and to ascertain <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s
                            future plans and policies in the light these considerations. You must
                            dispel any idea <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> may have
                            gotten from recent press reports that everything is okay in US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> relations and make him understand that
                            we are coming to a point where our sensitivity is as important as his,
                            stressing that we have a common problem to work out to permit us to
                            proceed together towards our joint objective of winning the war against
                            the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0155"/>
                        <p>7. You should hit hard on consequences of now inevitable <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> debate and difficulty US would have in
                            supporting <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> there in present
                            circumstances (you should, incidentally, make it absolutely clear that

                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be disaster.) Second, you
                            should elaborate difficulties with US public opinion and Congress using

                        <p>8. You should also emphasize to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> extreme time urgency—we have only ten days before
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> debate for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to restore its image.</p>
                        <p>9. You should also emphasize that while the problem here and in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> created by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> acts may or may not be aggravated by press distortions
                            problem is big and real and only <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            acts can solve it.</p>
                        <p>10. At the outset you should stress the points that relate to the public
                            opinion problem (para 2 above)—e.g., release of remaining students and
                            bonzes, removal press censorship, restoration of pagodas, etc., as
                            developed along lines generally agreed in our preceding exchanges,
                            leaving to later discussions additional measures we may think necessary
                            in light of results of assessment described para. 5 above and <gloss target="#t_SEPTEL1">septel</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>11. We have some doubts here about reliance upon [<hi rend="italic">less

                            allies, but your own authoritative discussion of these issues seems to
                            us indispensable.</p>

                        <p>1. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] stressed
                            the urgent crisis created by the situation in US Senate described in
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>'s no. 335<note n="3" xml:id="d72fn3">

                            </note> to me. They explained that passage of a resolution described in
                            the telegram would be an irreversible action and would commit every
                            Senator voting for it to vote against further appropriations.</p>
                        <p>2. They think <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was shaken by
                            this news which evidently he had not expected. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he had expected me to come
                            back, apparently, “to negotiate” with him about his resignation. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] said that
                            there was nothing for me to negotiate; that I, from a background of 25
                            years in US public life, had given my very best advice, which was for
                            him to leave the country immediately for six months. It was up to him to
                            take the advice or to reject it. There was nothing to haggle over.</p>
                        <p>3. Then came a long tirade by <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            who lost his usual impassive composure and walked up and down. Some of
                            his statements were:</p>
                        <p>a. “I'm the winning horse—they should bet on me. Why do they want to
                            finish me? I want to be—not the adviser to Pres. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>—but the adviser to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Henry Cabot Lodge</persName>.</p>
                        <p>b. “I may leave the country after a month and what if 100 Strategic
                            Hamlets go over to the Communists while I am away?</p>
                        <p>c. “I am alarmed by what's going on in the Armed Forces. If I leave, the
                            Armed Forces will take over the government. 'Ces grenouillards' (which I
                            translate as “these schemers” or 'these contrivers') of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> will sabotage the war effort.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: This is first admission I have seen
                            that Army was worrying him. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            also said he was burning his papers.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> is to leave on
                                Monday<note n="4" xml:id="d72fn4">September 9.</note>—for a two or
                            three months “rest” in Europe.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> stressed he would not
                            consider leaving country, but would formally resign without retaining
                            any connection with Strategic Hamlets. After a “number of months” had
                            gone by he might consider leaving for a period of 3 or 4 months. When he
                            did resign he would <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0158"/>not deny
                            that he had been kicked out. He would also consider any piece of
                            legislation which would help to appease Buddhists, deal with Decree Law
                            10 and rebuild pagodas.</p>

                            him. Planning Monday meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, using <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> telegram, <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> no. 331<note n="5" xml:id="d72fn5">In telegram 331,
                                September 5, the Department of State informed the Embassy in Saigon

                                could expect substantive debate on the issue and a condemnatory

                            for each target group. These should therefore be considered
                            guidelines.</p>
                        <p>1. Attitudes toward top <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            leadership:</p>
                        <p>a) To what extent has confidence in <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> been
                            impaired by recent events?</p>
                        <p>b) How is <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regarded? Has he
                            escaped most of opprobrium for recent actions? How is <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> regarded? Is he acceptable as
                            dominant force? Are <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> regarded predominantly as
                            separate or as Siamese twins?</p>
                        <p>c) What are attitudes toward Vice President? Key cabinet ministers? Other
                            top leaders?</p>

                            Buddhist crisis and present policies martial law and suppression
                            regarded as excessively oppressive?</p>
                        <p>e) Has discontent crystallized into disaffection? If so, how determined
                            and militant is disaffection? At what levels in bureaucracy and military
                            is disaffection most serious and explosive? How serious is impact on
                            efficiency and morale?</p>
                        <p>f) Does each target group have feeling of stake and participation in govt
                            policies and programs?</p>
                        <p>g) Do target groups believe situation will now stabilize under <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> leadership or that significant political challenge
                            by opposition to regime will occur?</p>
                        <p>h) What if any alternative political leadership is mentioned by
                            groups?</p>
                        <p>2. Attitudes toward top military leadership.</p>
                        <p>How are generals regarded now? Are their actions viewed as having
                            supported regime, and how is their failure move against regime
                            appraised? Are generals viewed as strong, weak, or irrelevant factor in
                            political situation?</p>
                        <p>3. Attitudes toward <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and war:</p>
                        <p>a) To what extent have developments last few weeks significantly affected
                            war effort against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>? b) Is feeling now
                            that war can be continued with reasonable prospect of success? Will
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> be able to regain momentum and
                            progress in the war? c) How has govt handling of Buddhist crisis
                            affected attitudes toward <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>? Is <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> now increasingly regarded as only
                            opposition to regime which has chance of success? d) Is there more
                            thinking now than before about rapprochement with Hanoi?</p>

                        <p>4. Attitudes toward external forces:</p>
                        <p>a) What are current attitudes in target groups toward US, US policies and
                            US advisors? b) Toward France and General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De

                        <p>Review of Deptels raises possibility we have not been sufficiently
                            precise in telling you our thoughts about the possible removal of
                            brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>From the viewpoint of Vietnamese solidarity and world and domestic US
                            opinion, it is important that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            not have a key role.</p>
                        <p>What we are not yet clear about is whether the step of insisting that he
                            depart the country for an extended period would be necessary to restore
                            the Vietnamese peoples' confidence in their government so as to permit a
                            victory in the war. It is on this point that we hope the reassessment
                            you are now engaged in will shed some light. End of message.</p>

                                informed the Embassy that it should not respond in writing to the
                                Government of Vietnam's request for release of the three Buddhist
                                monks who had received sanctuary in the Embassy. If asked by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> about release,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> should respond
                                that before the United States would consider releasing them it had
                                to be satisfied that South Vietnam was taking positive steps to
                                assure religious tolerance and redress specific Buddhist grievances.
                                The Department also asked if it would not be preferable in the
                                Embassy's view to exclude <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                    Quang</persName> from the discussions and to arrange for him to
                                leave South Vietnam. (Ibid.)</note> Embassy believes would be
                            preferable omit <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> from
                            discussion on release of bonzes. His strong belief in importance of
                            removing Ngo family (with possible exception <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>) from power render him enemy of
                            regime, which will most probably feel action against him (at least long
                            term detention) necessary for own security. Up to present <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has not released other top level
                            Buddhist leaders, and <persName>Quang</persName> may well be regarded by
                            Ngo family as most dangerous of all. As reftel suggests, believe best
                            course under current conditions would be for <persName>Quang</persName>
                            to leave country. He himself has requested this (Embtel 399).<note n="3" xml:id="d75fn3">Telegram 399, September 2, contained the text of a

                                1. (Ibid.)</note> As to feasibility, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> may well believe that oppositionists out of country do
                            not pose significant threat, although in case of
                                <persName>Quang</persName>, his probable ability to aid in
                            mobilization of international Buddhist opinion against <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would be factor working against their
                            willingness see him leave.</p>
                        <p>As to <persName>Quang</persName>'s leadership potential, Embassy believes
                            this to be considerable. At time of May 8 incident in Hue,
                                <persName>Quang</persName> demonstrated his complete mastery of
                            crowds on several occasions. In addition to this ability to speak
                            effectively to the public he has impressed Embassy officers by the
                            acuteness of his intelligence and his political awareness. He is in
                            addition self-assured to point of conceit. While in Embassy he has made
                            systematic effort to build himself in our eyes as well as to attempt
                            persuade us to pursue policy conducive to his ends. While his goal has
                            been replacement of key members of Ngo family he has maintained to date
                            that he had not considered in detail how Buddhist tactics (popular
                            agitation) would lead to result desired or whether forces Buddhists
                            setting in motion might not result in overall change for worse. In
                            response to questioning he has limited himself to general statement that
                            in his view <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> could not gain control of
                            situation in <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0163"/>event of a change
                            and that removal members Ngo family could only be considered change for
                            better. (We are continuing to probe further on this subject.)</p>
                        <p>Although he has disclaimed idea of himself assuming political leadership,
                            believe it be quite possible that he has in fact entertained idea, but
                            that he has given little or no systematic thought to problems which
                            would be entailed. In short, as oppositionist,
                                <persName>Quang</persName> possesses very considerable leadership
                            powers; as potential member of government, he has given no basis for an
                            evaluation of his ability, although his basic intelligence, courage,
                            force of personality and political awareness would argue that his
                            leadership potential could be utilized in fields other than
                            religion.</p>
                        <p>Should of course be borne in mind that both <persName>Quang</persName>'s
                            physical presence in Embassy and his awareness of US importance as
                            factor in situation lead him to concentrate his efforts on attempt to
                            influence our policy. Therefore possible that many of his statements to
                            us (e.g., anti-Communism, anti-neutralism) may reflect his tactical
                            judgments rather than deeply held convictions.<note n="4" xml:id="d75fn4">

                                    of which were worth risking at that time. The better course, in
                                    the Embassy's view, was to continue to hold <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>. If a new Vietnamese
                                    Government emerged he might play a role in it; if the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government continued,
                                    then the United States would have to evacuate him without

                                <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Rufus Phillips</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> late evening September 7:</p>
                        <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0164"/>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> opened the conversation
                            by saying that he felt completely useless now. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> says that he has been bought by the
                            Americans, and would certainly kill him if he tried to resign.
                            Nevertheless, he said, he would like to resign, and would like to know
                            if the Americans could arrange to get him out of the country if he
                            decided to quit. He was told that the matter would be looked into.</p>
                        <p>2. According to <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is now in effective control of the
                            country. He is the only one whom the President trusts, and, in effect,
                            the President has mentally abdicated in his favor. Ordinarily at
                            meetings, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> speaks for the
                            President, and the President gives assent; on other occasions the
                            President simply repeats what <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            has told him to say.</p>
                        <p>3. Both <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and the President are
                            completely unrealistic about the progress of the war, in <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>'s opinion. Each has asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> how long the country
                            could last without US assistance. His reply, [he] said, was that it
                            might last for six months without other than military aid; but that a
                            cut-off in military aid would precipitate an almost immediate
                            collapse.</p>
                        <p>4. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>
                            recalled that in a recent conversation with Colonel <persName corresp="#p_LAC1">Lac</persName> (Permanent Commissioner,
                            Interministerial Committee for Strategic Hamlets), the latter, in
                            response to a question, said that in his opinion the present
                            administration, if it continued in office, would lose the war in 1965.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LAC1">Lac</persName> went on to say that in
                            his opinion, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is losing the war
                            in the Delta now. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> added
                            that he was in full accord with <persName corresp="#p_LAC1">Lac</persName> on the latter point.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said that several
                            Generals had been in contact with him, seeking his views on a coup
                            d'etat. (He would not identify the Generals.) He had refused to be
                            drawn, not feeling sure that they were not acting as agents
                            provocateurs. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> went on to
                            say that in his opinion, General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> could definitely be “had”, for an appropriate price
                            in liquor, women, and cash.</p>
                        <p>6. Asked for his opinion about what the Americans should do, <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said he believed that they
                            should cut off aid, as that would undoubtedly cause everyone to realize
                            that they meant business. He stressed that personal loyalty to the
                            President on the part of many of the officers was one of the major
                            inhibiting factors-but that all were looking to the Americans for
                            leadership—and that most could be expected to follow the Americans'
                            lead.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> also discussed the last
                            meeting of the Interministerial Committee at which General Cao of IV
                            Corps presented a briefing. Cao, he said, stressed that operations in
                            the Delta area are improving, and that the troops are becoming more
                            mobile there. He made three interesting points:</p>
                        <p>a. The Civil Guard and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> should not be
                            given modern weapons. such as carbines.</p>
                        <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0165"/>
                        <p>b. Factories for making “home-made” weapons should be established to arm
                            the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, so that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> could
                            not arm themselves from them; and</p>
                        <p>c. The only thing that he needs to win in the Delta is more troops.</p>
                        <p>8. According to <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> proceeded to interpellate Cao,
                            starting by asking how many static defense posts there now are in the
                            Delta. “2301, sir,” said Cao. “Isn't that more than there were six
                            months ago?” “Yes, sir,” said Cao. “How can you then say that the troops
                            are more mobile now?” said <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.
                            There was no answer. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> went on
                            to ask how the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> could be expected to be effective with
                            “home-made” weapons, if they were unable to defend themselves with
                            modern weapons? Receiving no answer, he then asked if more and better
                            Strategic Hamlets were being built, as Cao said, and therefore
                            presumably releasing more troops from static defense duties, why force
                            levels were steadily rising, and even more troops being sought by Cao.
                            Again, there was no answer.</p>
                        <p>9. Asked directly if he believed <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was on the verge of taking overt action to eliminate
                            Ministers or Americans, or to establish a rapprochement with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said that he did not think there was any serious
                            danger at this time, since <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is
                            so well satisfied with the way things are going. He added, however, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was perfectly capable of
                            any or all of these measures, and might well resort to them if he felt
                            pressed. In his view, the Americans would do well to prepare for these
                            contingencies.</p>
                        <p>10. As a closing comment, <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>
                            said that virtually all work has stopped in the Ministries in Saigon. He
                            cited as an example, a recent visit by the Minister of National Economy,
                            carrying a detective novel. Queried by <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>, the Minister said, in substance: “all we, or
                            anybody else, do in the office is to read these. We are waiting.”</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> was very obviously deeply
                            disturbed by the present situation, convinced that it can only be
                            resolved by American leadership, and equally convinced that he is
                            helpless to do anything. This last is almost certainly correct.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> went over much same

                            that conversation:</p>
                        <p>Re para 6, <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said he had
                            little confidence in the Generals, i.e. in their will and ability to
                            take action. Only General mentioned by name was <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>, Chief of Staff. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> thought that <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> was loyal to President but, on
                            other hand, he might be working with Colonel Thao (see <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> 0483).<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> indicated to <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> considerable concern for his
                            personal safety, saying that he took seriously being on Tran Van Khiem's
                            assassination list. He plainly believes that <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> has a real organization and
                            mentioned that Colonel Phuoc, Chief of Vinh Long Province, is a part of
                            it. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> is especially
                            concerned that Italian Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DOG1">D'Orlandi</persName> has been touting him for PriMinister. “Does he
                            want to get me assassinated?”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is definitely trying to destroy
                            him. He is telling Diem that <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> is American agent, and <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> senses that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s attitude toward him has
                            changed. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is also having
                            Special Forces pass out leaflets claiming that <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> and Minister of Justice
                                <persName corresp="#p_LUONG1">Luong</persName> have received US

                        </p>
                        <p>3. After finishing this description of conditions in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and in Congress, I said it was obvious
                            that public opinion could not condone the idea that American loss of
                            lives and American aid were being expended for the repression of human
                            rights. The President had expressed doubts that victory was possible
                            without a change of policies and it was my personal view that without
                            some change of policy the suspension of aid would become a very real
                            possibility.</p>
                        <p>4. I said I had noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            desired a Congressional investigation. It was my observation that
                            whenever a foreigner tried to put himself between the President and
                            Congress he risked to lose a great deal. In fact I had never seen a case
                            in which this procedure had done other than injure the foreigner. He
                            denied that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was asking
                            for a Congressional investigation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had merely said that it was up to Congress to decide
                            whether to have one or not.</p>
                        <p>5. I then said that it was vital to get a change of personnel and a
                            change of policies. My first advice to him was that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> should go away, not returning at
                            least until end of December—after the appropriations had been voted. He
                            looked at me aghast and said “why it would be out of the question for
                            him to go away when he could do so much for the Strategic Hamlets.” When
                            I said many regarded him as the head of the Secret Police and the
                            director of the Aug 20 raids, Diem said: “He has been very unjustly
                            accused. He was not the one who organized the raid of Aug 20. He was
                            always the influence in favor of a flexible solution of the problem. He
                            is the only man in the Cabinet who is neither a technician nor a lawyer
                            nor a bureaucrat. If American opinion is in the state that you describe
                            then it is up to you, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, to disintoxicate American opinion;” the French
                            word he used is: “desintoxiquer”.</p>
                        <p>6. I said I recognized that it was part of my job to try to straighten
                            American opinion and that I would be only too glad to do so if he would
                            give me something with which to work.</p>
                        <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0168"/>
                        <p>7. I then brought up the matter of eliminating censorship of the press.
                            This started him off on a long harangue about the Buddhist problem,
                            about how they were in a state of evolution with the young men in their
                            late thirties and early forties of which he mentioned particularly
                                <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> and the other fellow
                            Tran Van Nhan. They could write and speak very well, but now the whole
                            thing had been settled by the understanding which he had reached with
                            the regular leaders of the Buddhist movement. When I said that these
                            were considered to be puppets he said how could anybody say that, they
                            were the people who were in the job and were not put there by me.</p>
                        <p>8. Finally I got him back to the question of censorship. He said as far
                            as the Vietnamese press was concerned the journalists did their own
                            censorship and there was no censorship in advance, that whenever the
                            government saw something that was bad for the morale of the Army or
                            totally untrue then they would take it out. As far as the foreign press
                            was concerned there was practically no censorship at all, the foreigners
                            were using planes and using mail and that it was actually impossible to
                            control.</p>
                        <p>9. Whenever I tried to get back either to the departure of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> or the lifting of the censorship of
                            the press he would start off on something else. One of his topics was
                            the fact that he had asked the US Govt for its agreement on their new
                                <gloss target="#t_AMB1">Amb</gloss> a week ago and got no answer. It
                            was obviously extremely annoying to him that Tran Van Chnong and Mrs.
                            Chnong were still in the Vietnamese Emb in Wash. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: Can the Dept tell me something about this?</p>
                        <p>10. He said that his representative proposed to show in New York that the
                            pagodas had been turned into bordellos, that they had found a great deal
                            of female underwear, love letters and obscene photographs. That the
                            virgins were being despoiled there. They knew of one priest who had
                            despoiled 13 virgins. This apparently was part of the “crisis of growth”
                            of the Buddhist movement.</p>
                        <p>11. He said that out of 4700 pagodas in the country only between 20 and
                            30 had been searched and the only one that had been damaged was the Xa
                            Loi Pagoda which had to be touched because “they were using the tower in
                            order to drop things on peoples heads.” Only 70 prisoners remained.</p>
                        <p>12. I then once again got back to the need for new policies and new
                            people in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in order to change the
                            thinking in the Western world, notably in Wash. Whereupon he started off
                            on the situation in Hue. He said that in particular the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> was extremely offensive, that they
                            were printing and distributing tracts to students telling the students
                            to demonstrate on behalf of the Buddhists and to conduct strikes; that
                            they were abusing diplomatic immunity in that they were using houses
                            which possessed diplomatic immunity to print and distribute <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0169"/>these tracts. That Asher, Chief of the
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> at Hue, had incited two
                            professors to tell the most barefaced lies. He hoped something could be
                            done about the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>13. Speaking of the recent student strikes he said that this was a
                            Communist plot, that the Communists had abandoned the idea of taking
                            over the countryside and then leaving the cities for dessert. Because of
                            the success of the Strategic Hamlet Program they were going after the
                            cities first.</p>
                        <p>14. I then read from the Dept's 355<note n="4" target="d77fn4">Dated
                                September 7, not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, SOC
                                14-1 S VIET)</note> which said that the Associated Press quoted
                            Bishop <persName corresp="#p_THUC1">Thuc</persName> as saying that the
                            US has spent $20 million trying to replace <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUC1">Thuc</persName> shouldn't have said
                            this but he wondered whether it was true. “I will speak to him about
                            it.”</p>
                        <p>15. I then read him the passage from the Dept's 355 in which Reuters
                            quotes Bishop <persName corresp="#p_THUC1">Thuc</persName> as saying the
                            Buddhist monks were not suicides but murder cases and were killed with a
                            hammer. He had no comment at all.</p>
                        <p>16. When I got up to go he said he had had a meeting of Generals recently
                            who told him the war was going very well in spite of all the trouble
                            they had had. As I parted he said he thanked me for coming in and said
                            he would carefully consider all the things that I had said. I reiterated
                            that I hoped very much that there would be changes in personnel and in
                            policy in order to make continued support of the war possible.</p>
                        <p>17. Although I stated what I intended to state many times, I did not feel
                            he was really deeply interested. He seemed totally absorbed with his own
                            problems here and was justifying himself and attacking his enemies.
                            Perhaps this is all part of his medieval view of life. He is constantly
                            preoccupied with fighting back, which is a commendable trait in many
                            ways but makes it hard to get a new idea across to him.</p>

                        <p>453. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>. For <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> from <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName>. This is interim report based on observations
                            and discussions both in Saigon and provinces. Have spent bulk of time in
                            central coastal provinces where Buddhist problem is most acute.</p>
                        <p>1. I have been struck by fear which pervades Saigon, Hue, and Da Nang.
                            These cities have been living under reign of terror which continues. I
                            have just been told by Dean of Law School Vu Quoc Thuc that again today
                            hundreds of students were arrested.</p>
                        <p>These are also cities of hate directed mainly at Nhus but President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> himself is increasingly
                            identified with Nhus as sharing responsibility. Most families of
                            government officials (civilian and military) in cities have felt
                            government's oppressive hands on their children, with results in
                            attitude that can be expected. Growing number of students themselves are
                            talking of Viet Cong being preferred alternative to existing government
                            (I have been told this in both Saigon and Hue).</p>
                        <p>American contacts, both official and social, with Vietnamese have been
                            severely curtailed in cities since August 20 because of Vietnamese fear
                            to be seen with Americans. I have personally experienced furtiveness
                            which appears necessary to talk with Vietnamese in current police state
                            atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>2. In visits to Hue and Da Nang I found following re four northern
                            provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien, Quang Nam and Quang Tin based on
                            conversations with Consul, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, [less than 1 1ine not declassified] officials:</p>
                        <p>Army presents mixed picture. Top commanders are loyal-not too
                            surprisingly since dissidents tend promptly be replaced (like General
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGHIEM1">Nghiem</persName> who disapproved
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Buddhist policy by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri</persName> who supports it).</p>
                        <p>Considerable disgruntlement exists below top level, but extent is not
                            clear perhaps partly because of limitations under which <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officers operate with respect to
                            political field. Seems clear, however, that discipline continues prevail
                            under present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>In civilian bureaucracy province chiefs remain loyal—again not
                            unexpectedly since they are shifted if any doubt arises (as in Thua
                            Thien recently) or continue despite incompetence if loyal (as in Quang
                            Tin). <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0171"/>District chiefs to extent
                            known by persons I contacted probably are loyal with one exception.
                            Civil bureaucracies in Hue [and?] Da Nang riddled with dissatisfaction
                            (as in Saigon).</p>
                        <p>Course of war appears be taking downturn in certain of these provinces.
                            Quang Tin had worst month in August since last November. In Quang Nam
                            several recent incidents seen [seem?] indicate that VC who were being
                            pushed away from coastal areas now beginning push back in that
                            direction. Not known whether popular dissatisfaction has been factor in
                            these developments, but may be pertinent that in both Quang Nam and Thua
                            Thien discontent over Buddhist issue extends to villages and in Hue it
                            is now being reported that villagers say they may as well submit to
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> as to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> “conciliatory” measures have no
                            effect in changing attitudes. I am told that, despite release of some
                            arrested, second rounds of arrests have occurred and some of those
                            released are re-arrested by a second security service. Pagodas and
                            schools are claimed officially to be open but in many cases are not.
                            Perhaps noteworthy that Consul in Hue and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line not declassified</hi>] Da Nang have seen only three bonzes in
                            streets since August 20.</p>
                        <p>3. I also stopped in Nha Trang and talked with American military officers
                            who indicated from their limited vantage point of staying out of
                            civilian affairs that there appeared be no further Buddhist problem. I
                            missed [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] but
                            have been informed in Saigon that he has reported people in that area
                            very upset and held down only by fear of retaliation and atmosphere of
                            terror.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> underestimated seriousness of
                            situation and moved grudgingly and too slowly. It now seems clear that
                            Thich Tri Quang and a few leaders around him had far-reaching political
                            objectives from outset, probably preceding 8 May. [<hi rend="italic">1

                            especially American public opinion. We must assume that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concluded its own survival was coming
                            into serious question. It would almost necessarily identify <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> survival with victory in war against

                            Against this background, violation of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> assurances to U.S. representatives with respect to its
                            conciliation policy toward Buddhists was probably almost predictable.

                            of action taken against pagodas. Conclusion is that general officers
                            were themselves also involved in responsibility for 21 August.</p>

                            officers had done some thinking about assuming governmental power but
                            were not unified, determined, or emotionally geared up to coup d'etat
                            action. Do not believe general officers felt that strongly against
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> or that enough of them
                            had deeply rooted animus against <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. They were simply not ready for action and would not
                            embark on operation of this kind without major prospects of success.
                            Assume also that they did not want to engage in all out fight in streets
                            of capital city. At no time did they seem able to shift balance of
                            forces sufficiently in their favor, even if one were to assume that
                            they, in fact, made determined effort to do so. Yesterday, or day
                            before, General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> is reported
                            to have left for Dalat on short several-day vacation leaving his command
                            with Chief of Staff Colonel Co who is responsive to General <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> and Presidency. Despite absence

                            formidable antagonist in terms of forces he commands and his loyalty to

                            officers to act on this apparently favorable opportunity. Am inclined to
                            feel general officers will seek evolutionary accommodation with Diem (if
                            he permits them to do so) unless overall situation clearly deteriorates,
                            there is breakdown of civil order or governmental machinery, or unless
                            war effort begins to go backward seriously. This is not to say that
                            other elements in military establishment might not attempt coup at some
                            time in future.</p>

                            among certain classes of population but it is extremely difficult to
                            gauge intensity or pervasiveness of such effects. [<hi rend="italic">1

                        <p>What follows is based on six assumptions, all of them controversial which
                            will be discussed at length separately if desired. They are:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">A new Vietnamese government is essential</hi>.</p>
                        <p>There is mounting evidence that the war cannot be won with the present
                            regime, especially in view of the damage done to popular support during
                            the Buddhist crisis. Even if the present regime can win, with continued
                            U.S. aid, the point has become irrelevant. International and U.S.
                            domestic public opinion probably would deny the U.S. the option of
                            trying again. Such a try would also be an unacceptable humiliation of
                            U.S. prestige after our present open effort to remove the Nhus from
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Real power must go to a new man</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The focus of present indignation has been the Nhus. In fact, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and his wife are as much symptoms
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s shortcomings as they have
                            been a cause. The true failure over the years to rally the Vietnamese
                            people must be blamed on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            himself. He has always controlled the power base, perhaps even now.
                            Because of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s peculiar,
                            rather neurotic relationship with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, it is to be expected furthermore that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s removal would simply force
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> deeper into suspicious
                            isolation, making him more ineffective than ever. He should be retained
                            only as a figurehead in the interest of stability.</p>

                        <p>The regime over the years has built up powerful loyal forces which are

                            unacceptable gains, there is only one sure recourse: an advance decision
                            to introduce U.S. combat forces if necessary.</p>

                            to promote unseating of the regime and against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, as well as a willingness to accept an
                            engagement comparable with Korea if the Communists choose to escalate.
                            Shock waves from loss of Viet-Nam to communism would be disastrous
                            throughout Southeast Asia, which is strategically vital to U.S.
                            security. Conversely, this kind of strong and successful U.S. resort to
                            force would strengthen resistance to communism throughout Asia and other
                            underdeveloped areas. It would also be a significant defeat of the
                            critical Chinese test in Viet-Nam of their ideology on war.</p>

                            in any case. U.S. forces in Viet-Nam would be used contrarily to help
                            the people, i.e. to carry out policies now in effect but often botched.
                            Their presence and example would quickly inspire better leadership and
                            initiative among the Vietnamese forces, as indeed was the experience in
                            Korea.</p>

                        <p>The available evidence indicates that there is a deep reluctance in the
                            Vietnamese officer corps to accept the hazards of promoting a coup
                            d'etat. It is therefore possible that action to topple the Ngo Dinh
                            regime would not automatically follow even the most severe U.S.
                            measures, e.g. suspension of aid, with resulting near chaos. It is also
                            essential that the eventual successor regime be willing to cooperate
                            with the U.S. including commitment of U.S. combat forces if the war can
                            be won no other way.</p>
                        <p>In the writer's judgment, conditions in Viet-Nam have deteriorated so
                            badly that the U.S. would be drawing to a three-card straight to gamble
                            its interest there on anything short of an ultimate willingness <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0177"/>to use combat troops. Even if
                            all-out pressures succeeded in unseating the Ngo Dinhs, which is not an
                            automatic certainty, at least not immediately, there is real danger that
                            the successor regime would be equally or even more ineffective against
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. There is also the danger that the
                            Vietnamese military forces would fragment, dividing the country into
                            rival camps, with disastrous consequences.</p>
                        <p>If we are not willing to resort to U.S. forces, it is wholly possible
                            that efforts to unseat the Ngo Dinhs would produce results that would be
                            worse, from the U.S. viewpoint, than a negotiated “neutral” settlement.
                            It is also possible that a prolonged deadlock would stimulate an
                            irresistible shift in international and American public opinion in favor
                            of such a settlement.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, a decision now to use U.S. forces if necessary would
                            give the whole U.S. effort psychological lift, producing confidence that
                            we need not be frustrated indefinitely, giving us a sure hand that has
                            been lacking in the past. When and if it became desirable to make this
                            intention public, we would have a lever of immense value vis-a-vis the
                            Vietnamese. Such a new sureness in our actions, with the clear
                            implication that the U.S. “means business,” would quickly get through to
                            the Vietnamese and to third countries and thus conceivably itself remove
                            the need to resort to force.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps it should also be noted that the present situation in Viet-Nam is
                            confronting the U.S. with what was certainly an inevitable showdown on
                            the thesis that Western industrial power somehow must always be
                            frustrated by Communist guerrilla tactics applied against a weak,
                            underdeveloped government that refused foreign advice and reforms of the
                            very ills that the Communists live on. There are incipient insurrections
                            of this sort all over the underdeveloped world and the outcome in
                            Viet-Nam will have critical bearing on U.S. capability to prevent and/or
                            suppress them.</p>
                        <p>In the writer's opinion, furthermore, there is a very real possibility
                            that if and as Viet-Nam is conclusively being lost to the Communists,
                            the U.S. will be forced to use force in any case as a last resort …

                            as we did so unexpectedly in Korea. It would be vastly wiser-and more
                            effective-to make this unpalatable decision now.</p>
                        <p>From this basis of strength, U.S. policy should seek establishment of a
                            new government that would be as strong as possible but in any case would
                            accept introduction of U.S. forces if necessary to defeat the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Ideally the whole Ngo Dinh family should
                            be removed, but the U.S. would accept retention of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in a figurehead role. It is
                            essential that the Nhus leave the country permanently. (A specific time
                            period, say six months, would not be sufficient since their influence
                            and political apparatus would survive.)</p>
                        <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0178"/>
                        <p>Application of this policy should be on a step-by-step basis, thus
                            hopefully achieving U.S. ends with minimum damage to the war effort
                            against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Recommended
                            procedure:</p>
                        <p>1. For the short term, continuation of the present heavy diplomatic
                            pressure on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. This would be
                            designed to combine with outside events-congressional threats to cut
                            aid, increased third country pressures in Saigon, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> censure, and perhaps even a world-wide trend toward
                            consideration of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">DeGaulle</persName>'s
                            proposals-to force <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and the
                            Nhus to capitulate voluntarily and/or precipitate a spontaneous military
                            coup.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that such pressure be developed with an eye to giving
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> some kind of
                            face-saving escape. Perhaps, for example, the U.S. should begin talking
                            publicly about ousting the whole family, so that it eventually could
                            compromise on departure of only the Nhus with the explanation that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had been “misled” or
                            some such. With Orientals in general and notably with the Ngo Dinhs,
                            capitulation is virtually impossible if they are painted into a
                            comer.</p>
                        <p>2. When this fails, as is probable, application of selected cuts in U.S.
                            assistance, preferably through imposition of conditions on its use
                            rather than outright surgery … <note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">Ellipsis in
                                the source text.</note> which would have the same effect. The cuts
                            should be applied to items of minimum importance to the war effort
                            against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and maximum importance to
                            the Nhus' political maneuvering, e.g. the Special Forces. The cuts
                            should be widely publicized and in fact be chosen more for their
                            psychological impact than expectation of serious damage to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> operations.</p>
                        <p>If this did not quickly produce a spontaneous coup, the U.S. should begin
                            covertly planning one. At this point dramatic deterioration of
                                U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> relations must be expected,
                            with distinct physical danger to U.S. nationals and a virtual standstill
                            in the advisory effort.</p>
                        <p>3. Suspension of all aid to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and
                            if this also failed to unseat the regime, implementation as quickly as
                            possible of the planned coup. If this also failed, or only partly
                            succeeded, there should be plentiful excuses to bring in U.S. forces,
                            e.g. to restore order, protect American citizens, etc. Such forces
                            should be prepared for attack by loyal <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> troops, but it is more likely that they would simply
                            act as power in being, making it possible now for the U.S. to have its
                            way by simply presenting the Ngo Dinhs with an ultimatum. Something
                            similar to this happened when U.S. forces were introduced into Lebanon
                            in 1958-with notably little resulting damage to the U.S. political
                            position in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that third country hostility toward the Ngo Dinhs is
                            already so considerable that this kind of reluctant, gradual but
                            persistently determined application of U.S. power would similarly be
                            accepted <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0179"/>in Asia. And once U.S.
                            forces had been introduced into Viet-Nam, it would be relatively
                            simple-on the invitation of the new regime-to keep them on hand to help,
                            if needed, in final destruction of the Viet Cong.</p>

                            concluded that among the factors required to support basic policy
                            decisions is a knowledge of the effect of recent events upon the
                            attitudes of the Vietnamese in general, and upon the war effort against
                            the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>One means of acquiring this knowledge is through the day-to-day
                            observations of U.S. military advisors. It was the purpose of the trip
                            to obtain a first-hand sampling of the observations of U.S. military
                            personnel who are in contact with the working Vietnamese military.</p>
                        <p>The horizons of the average U.S. advisor, except for those very near the
                            top, are limited. Their attention, and thus their direct knowledge, are
                            confined largely to the Vietnamese unit with whose fortunes they are
                            identified. In terms of what they actually see, hear and interpret daily
                            in this environment, their views have strong credibility. To the extent
                            possible, this report derives from discussion oriented upon such matters
                            of fact or of direct observation.</p>
                        <p>All Corps were visited. Substantive conversations were held with 87
                            members of the advisory system, from enlisted men of relatively low rank
                            to senior officers. They included advisors to commanders and staff
                            officers at levels from corps to company, and advisors to province
                            chiefs. Most conversations were held in the individual's daily
                            surroundings, either in the headquarters or in the field during
                            operations.</p>

                        <p>Occasionally, in the interest of saving time, several advisors were
                            assembled in a single place. The map<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3">Not
                                printed.</note> facing page 1 shows the place visited.</p>
                        <p>There is no way of knowing how many Vietnamese officer views are
                            reflected in these 87 interviews. Certainly, the number is great, and
                            the sampling thus has a reasonably broad base.</p>
                        <p>The principal effort was addressed to procuring views of the advisors
                            on:</p>
                        <p>The progress of the war; changes in the past few weeks; prospects for the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>Relations with their Vietnamese counterparts; changes since the emergence
                            of the crisis.</p>
                        <p>Attitudes of counterparts regarding the political problem, the Buddhist
                            issue, the national leadership and pursuit of the war.</p>
                        <p>Attitudes of the Vietnamese people—observed or reported by
                            counterparts—regarding the critical points mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>Complementary to the above, discussions were held with the Ambassador,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and his staff,
                            as well as with 22 Vietnamese officers, whose views were sought on the
                            critical issues wherever it was practicable to do so.</p>
                        <p>As a supplement to all the foregoing, key advisors were asked, through
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, to put their

                            colonel to sergeant. They were cheerful, enthusiastic and readily
                            prepared to discuss the key subjects. Obviously, they had been thinking

                        <p>(1) 33 of the 35 asserted that their advisory relationships had not been
                            changed in any way by the political crisis.</p>
                        <p>(2) All 35 were enthusiastic about the progress of the war and were
                            emphatic that their counterparts were laboring at the war and not at
                            politics.</p>
                        <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0182"/>
                        <p>(3) The Corps Advisor asserted that he was certain the Corps Commander
                            had been ordered to intensify operations against the Viet Cong</p>
                        <p>(4) 10 of the 35 had had limited discussion of political subjects with
                            their counterpart; 3 had gone into the matter deeply.</p>
                        <p>(5) 2 stated that their advisory relationship had degraded; one whose
                            counterpart asserted that there are too many Americans in Vietnam, and
                            another who detected an unwillingness to pass on combat
                            intelligence.</p>
                        <p>(6) One of the 35 reported hearing unfavorable comments regarding the
                            Saigon Government—addressed to <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh
                                Nhu</persName> and his wife.</p>
                        <p>(7) None had discussed coup rumors with their counterparts.</p>
                        <p>(8) 4 of the 35 reported hearing apprehensive comments regarding possible
                            suspension of U.S. aid.</p>
                        <p>b. In addition to the discussions with advisors, conversations were held
                            with 9 Vietnamese officers, from major general to captain. It was not
                            easy to break the ice with them on the sensitive issues. It was evident,
                            however, that they were genuinely intent on their combatant activities,
                            so much so as to give the impression that they could have little time
                            left for plotting and politicking.</p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>(1) General Cao, the IV Corps Commander, was willing to talk about
                            martial law or Buddhists, but not politics. He stated that there was no
                            martial law in his Corps area (this was confirmed separately by both
                            divisions); that there had never been any curfew restrictions (likewise
                            confirmed); that imposition of curfew would halt Saigon's fish
                            supply.</p>
                        <p>(2) General Nhon, <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> of the 21st Division,
                            stated that his troops had no concern over the Buddhist question; that
                            they were too busy fighting; Christians and Buddhists, side by side.</p>
                        <p>(3) The Corps G-3 (a major) stated that he is a Buddhist, and that his
                            wife, a Catholic, complains that <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame
                                Nhu</persName> talks too much.</p>
                        <p>(4) A major, Province Chief, stated that he (a Catholic) and his deputy
                            (a Buddhist) took early steps to ensure tranquillity by conferring with
                            bonzes and assuring them of support for free religious practice. He said
                            that the big Buddhist issue is for President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> to solve.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Incident to the visit, a helicopter-borne attack against a suspected Viet
                            Cong concentration was observed. It involved two Vietnamese battalions,
                            a Civil Guard Company, a River Force section, and 29 helicopters and
                            supporting tactical aircraft. It was professionally planned, well
                            coordinated and efficiently executed.</p>
                        <p>Contact was actually made with the Viet Cong. In the face of it, troops
                            were aggressive and well-led. When time limitations required that I
                            leave the scene of action, I took away two strong impressions; we could
                            not have executed the complex operation any better, and any combat force
                            that fights with the skill and energy which had been demonstrated is not
                            spending much time in intrigue.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">2. III Corps.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. The Corps Commander, General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>, is the martial law commander, and his
                            Corps—officially or not—is the martial law corps. It is still fighting
                            against the Viet Cong, but activity is less than it was a month ago.
                            Much of its attention is aimed at security of the Capital. Operations
                            are now beginning to increase in intensity, and there is indication that
                            the unfavorable preoccupation is diminishing. As would be expected,
                            attention to Saigon diminishes rapidly as the distance from the Capital
                            increases.</p>
                        <p>b. Advisor/counterpart relations have not degraded. There is a general
                            reluctance to discuss politics—apparently deriving from an official
                            Corps order. Such discussions as have been possible between advisors and
                            their counterparts have suggested loyalty—or obedience—to the
                            Government, concern over the need quickly to settle the Buddhist crisis
                            and to defeat the Viet Cong. There is an undercurrent of antipathy for
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">c. Specifics</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourteen officers and one enlisted advisor were interviewed. Reactions
                            were as follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) The Corps advisor, a two-year Vietnam veteran and a confidant of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>, states that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> is firmly locked to the
                            Palace, and has <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s
                            confidence; is surfeited with power and will keep his Corps—and Corps
                            area—oriented toward the Government. He is generally respected by his
                            officers. He stated that, of 10 Vietnamese officers who were willing to
                            discuss politics with him, only one was <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0183"/>deeply worried about the Buddhist problem, three were
                            vocally anti-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, expressing hope
                            that the U.S. will exert pressure to diminish Nhu's power with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, whom they respect.</p>
                        <p>He stated that neither martial law nor curfew has had any significant
                            impact on the civilians and military in the provinces, that civilians in
                            the provinces are largely apathetic to the problem, and expressed
                            confidence that offensive operations—impeded initially in the area near
                            Saigon—would begin to accelerate.</p>
                        <p>(2) Of the 13 other personnel interviewed, all agreed that the attention
                            of the 5th Division (only 20 miles from Saigon) is directed mainly at
                            the security of the city. Only three battalions of the division are now
                            fighting the Viet Cong, although it is planned that the number will
                            increase to six next week.</p>
                        <p>(3) Ten of the 13 volunteered that operations elsewhere had not been
                            impeded.</p>
                        <p>(4) All but one were firm that their counterpart relations had not
                            changed; that one asserted that he had detected a cooling attitude.</p>
                        <p>(5) Two stated that their counterparts had advised them that political
                            discussions with Americans were forbidden.</p>
                        <p>(6) Four of the 13 stated that their counterparts had privately expressed
                            favorable sentiments regarding Diem, unfavorable sentiments regarding
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and an intense desire to
                            get forward with the war.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">3. II Corps.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. This area exhibits its geographic remoteness from Saigon in terms of
                            continued prosecution of the war, minimal impact of curfew (0100 to 0400
                            in Pleiku) and continued effective relationships between the Vietnamese
                            military and their U.S. counterparts. Nineteen advisors were consulted.
                            It was difficult to get them to talk about anything but the war, and the
                            progress the Vietnamese are making.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">b. Specifics:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(1) The Corps Advisor reported that General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, the Corps Commander, has spent much time ensuring
                            that his military forces and his provincial authorities are fully
                            apprised of the facts in the situation (the party line). He states that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> has issued orders for
                            an intensification of all operations against the Viet Cong, aimed at
                            driving them into the mountains, destroying their food and harrying
                            their movements. The advisor reports that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> now spends more time in Saigon, is vocal in his
                            praise of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>; does not mention
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>(2) All nineteen officers interrogated averred that their relations with
                            their counterparts were excellent; two stated that they were closer than
                            before the crisis.</p>
                        <p>(3) Two reported Vietnamese inquiries, following reading Newsweek, of the
                            possibility of losing U.S. aid. One is quoted as saying, “You are our
                            only true friends. We cannot win without you.”</p>
                        <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0184"/>
                        <p>(4) Four advisors reported hearing younger officers speak adversely of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>; two were anxious, at the
                            same time, to evince respect for <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, one, in criticizing <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, stated that nothing could be done. “This is our
                            country. We have nowhere else to go and no money to go with.”</p>
                        <p>(5) One advisor had been lectured by his counterpart on the heavy-handed
                            conduct of the Government in connection with the Buddhists—with whom he
                            had no sympathy.</p>
                        <p>(6) One advisor to a province chief stated that his counterpart was
                            derisive of press claims of religious intolerance. The counterpart is a
                            Montagnard (highlander) major, originally a Buddhist, converted
                            Catholic, now a practicing Episcopalian who is actually building an
                            Episcopal mission in Pleiku with Vietnamese engineers.</p>
                        <p>(7) Seven advisors quoted their counterparts as stating that the Corps
                            policy was to focus on fighting the Viet Cong, to get into the field
                            more and to stay there longer.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">4. I Corps.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. The general reaction derived from the military in this area is that,
                            except for the fury generated in Hue by the original Buddhist troubles,
                            it is business as usual, with the Viet Cong getting the business. The
                            war, undeniably, is going well, and 92% of the rural population is now
                            in strategic hamlets. Both officers and enlisted men have expressed
                            discontent with the Buddhist problem, but their rancor seems more
                            oriented upon <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and Madame Nhu
                            than upon <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> or the
                            Government. Twenty advisors were consulted. They represented a full
                            cross section of the Corps area advisory contingent.</p>
                        <p>b. Specifics:</p>
                        <p>(1) All twenty told the usual story of no change in their advisory
                            relationships. Two stated that their counterparts were even closer to
                            them because of their intense interest in reaming the significance of
                            the world situation.</p>
                        <p>(2) The 1st Division advisor (Hue) stated that his counterpart (General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri</persName>) had made a definite
                            effort to accelerate operations in the past two weeks, and that this was
                            being felt throughout the unit. He quoted his counterpart as saying that
                            the local area could be expected to support the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government, but that “nobody
                            loves <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>”.</p>
                        <p>(3) The advisor to the 3d Regiment (Hue) quoted his counterpart as saying
                            that the current crisis has meant little to the enlisted men or to the
                            common people, that only the cities have been concerned, and that in
                            those areas it is “more noise than anything else”.</p>
                        <p>(4) One advisor reported a conversation with a Vietnamese officer
                            (Buddhist) who was severely critical of the handling of the Buddhist
                            matter in Hue.</p>
                        <p>(5) Three of the 20 interrogated were highly critical either of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, or of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and his wife. One said they should be chased from
                            the country. One said that <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame
                                Nhu</persName> at the U.N. would be a tragedy for Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>(6) None of the 20 had heard any comments regarding the question of
                            withdrawing U.S. aid.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">5. The Navy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In a discussion with the senior advisor to the Vietnamese Navy, he
                            disclosed the following as the expressed attitudes of Navy
                            personnel:</p>
                        <p>a. The commander of the Navy is loyal to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, as a person and as the head of the Government. He
                            states that he is a military man and will support any government that is
                            constitutionally established.</p>
                        <p>b. Four key officers in the Navy are agreed that the imposition of
                            martial law was necessary, but that the abrasive aspects which have
                            accompanied it are the responsibility of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, who ought to leave the country.</p>
                        <p>b. Junior and mid-grade officers have made no significant statements on
                            the subject. They, in fact, have been extremely busy with their Saigon
                            security tasks and their routine sea and river activities.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">6. The Air Force.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Conference with the senior advisor to the Air Force elicited the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>a. There are many Air Force officers who are overly attentive to
                            politics, including the commander.</p>
                        <p>b. On balance, their comments exhibit a loyalty to the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government either out of
                            patriotism (on the part of many, sincere younger officers who are U.S.
                            trained), or of opportunism (on the part of the more senior officers who
                            are French trained and who enjoy their position due to the current
                            regime).</p>
                        <p>c. The Air Force war effort has not degraded significantly since the
                            crisis.</p>
                        <p>d. Officers have expressed the view to the senior advisor that the Viet
                            Cong war will be won—political vibrations notwithstanding—if the U.S.
                            continues its aid.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">7. The Marines.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The senior advisor to the Marine Brigade contributed the following:</p>
                        <p>a. The entire brigade must be accounted wholly loyal to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. Colonel Khang, the commander, is
                            intensely devoted to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and
                            his officers will follow him without question.</p>
                        <p>b. On the night of 30 August Khang, who is on intimate terms with his
                            advisor, confided to him that there was probably going to be a coup that
                            night, that he would lead the counter-coup and asked the advisor to care
                            for his family affairs (8 children) in case he did not survive.</p>
                        <p>c. The units of the brigade are either busy fighting or anxious to do so.
                            Their attention is on the war.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">8. The Senior Advisor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The final interview was with General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>. He assessed the temper of the military forces
                            in detail, and in much the same terms as were derived from the visits
                            described in the preceding paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>He is convinced that the programs we have under way are sufficiently
                            matured that it would be extremely difficult to put them in serious
                            disarray.</p>
                        <p>He believes that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is seeking
                            now to get the country back to what passes for normal, and is emphatic
                            about the relatively minor effect the Buddhist repressions and the many
                            ineptitudes of martial law have had on the country at large.</p>
                        <p>He believes that both sentiment and reality polarize strongly and
                            properly against the Nhus; that the country could survive—and
                            flourish—with them gone and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            still there.</p>
                        <p>He is pursuing the military advisory role exactly as before, and is in
                            frequent contact with the Ambassador, who obviously seeks and respects
                            his counsel.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">9. The Ambassador.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A final interview was held with the Ambassador just before departure, and
                            following his long meeting of 9 September with President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. Since it has been reported
                                separately,<note n="5" xml:id="d82fn5">
                                <ref target="#d77">Apparent reference to Document 77</ref>.</note>
                            his debrief will not be repeated here, beyond recounting these
                            peripheral comments:</p>
                        <p>a. The Ambassador was impressed with the difficulty of getting <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to contemplate the points he
                            sought to make.</p>
                        <p>b. He felt that the greatest impact was probably made by the discussion
                            of the grave reaction which Diem is courting in the U.S. Congress.</p>
                        <p>c. He was not sanguine concerning the success of his appeal that Nhu
                            should depart, in the nation's interest, but is not prepared to
                            acknowledge this is impossible to achieve.</p>
                        <p>d. Just prior to the close of the discussion he observed that the Vietnam
                            war is, in his view, the key to our Asian position and the controlling
                            factor in the future of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and our
                            forward posture in the Pacific. He said that we cannot afford to lose,
                            and that he is both resolute and confident that an effective formula can
                            be found.</p>

                        <p>The shooting war is still going ahead at an impressive pace. It has been
                            affected adversely by the political crisis, but the impact is not

                        <p>There is a lot of war left to fight, particularly in the Delta, where the
                            Viet Cong remain strong.</p>
                        <p>Vietnamese officers of all ranks are well aware of the Buddhist issue.
                            Most have viewed it in detachment and have not permitted religious
                            differences significantly to affect their internal military
                            relationship.</p>
                        <p>Vietnamese military commanders, at the various echelons, are obedient and
                            could be expected to execute any order they view as lawful.</p>
                        <p>The U.S./Vietnamese military relationship has not been damaged by the
                            political crisis, in any significant degree.</p>
                        <p>There is some dissatisfaction, among Vietnamese officers, with the
                            national administration. It is focused far more on <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> than on President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s departure would be hailed, but
                            few officers would extend their necks to bring it about.</p>

                        <p>Excluding the very serious political and military factors external to
                            Vietnam, the Viet Cong war will be won if the current U.S. military and
                            sociological programs are pursued, irrespective of the grave defects in
                            the ruling regime.</p>
                        <p>Improvements in the quality of the Vietnamese Government are not going to
                            brought about by leverage applied through the military. They do not have
                            much, and will probably not use what they have.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName> gave his
                                report:<note n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">Based on <ref target="#d78">Document 78</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName> stated he had found
                            a virtual breakdown of the civil government in Saigon as well as a
                            pervasive atmosphere of fear and hate arising from the police reign of
                            terror and the arrests of students. The war against the Viet Cong has
                            become secondary to the “war” against the regime. There is also the
                            danger of the outbreak of a religious war between Buddhists and
                            Communists [Catholics] unless the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            ceases oppression of the Buddhists. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is held responsible for all the repressive measures,
                            but Diem is increasingly identified as sharing responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName> said he also found
                            a similar atmosphere of fear and hate in Hue and Da Nang. In the
                            northern coastal area the Viet Cong have made recent advances in Quang
                            Tin and Quang Nam. It is not clear whether this is attributable to the
                            Buddhists, but it is clear Buddhist agitation extended to the rural
                            areas of Quang Nam and Thua Thien and that reports have come from Hue of
                            villagers in Thua Thien opting for the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Students in Hue and Saigon are also talking of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> as a preferred alternative to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName> concluded that he
                            was convinced by his visit that the war against the Viet Cong could not
                            be won if <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> remains in

                            was reporting on “national” attitudes.</p>

                            there was also paralysis in 1961 and we came through at that time.
                            Further, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName> has held
                            the opinion that we could not win the war with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> for some time.<note n="5" xml:id="d83fn5">

                                discussion: “Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> reminded Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName> that in 1961 he had made the same
                                statement, forecasting that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                                would soon defeat the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. He asked
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName> to rationalize
                                how, in the ensuing years, so much progress had been made by a
                                government which he forecast could not survive. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName> did not respond, because
                                he was interrupted by the President, who asked how it could be that
                                two people who had observed the same area could have such divergent
                                reactions. After a period of silence, when it became evident that no
                                one else was going to respond, I suggested to the President that the
                                answer was plain—that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName> had given him a metropolitan viewpoint on
                                Vietnam; that I had given him a national viewpoint.”</note>

                        <p>Mac Bundy said that in 1961 we overcame the paralysis by strengthening
                            the effort against the Viet Cong; now it was the government that was
                            causing the fear and paralysis and it was a little difficult to
                            strengthen a war against the government.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Rufus Phillips</persName> reported as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>He had many friends in Viet-Nam as a result of long years of working
                            there. He knew <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> well,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> well and many of the
                            officers and Generals well. He had an opportunity to know the mood of
                            the rural areas since he was in charge of the strategic hamlet program.
                            He said that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has lost the
                            confidence and respect of both the officers and the civil servants. They
                            do not support the government with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> in it and would not support the government if they
                            had an alternative. He said there was now a crisis of confidence in
                            Viet-Nam not only between the Vietnamese people and their government but
                            between the Vietnamese people and the Americans. As far-as the
                            Vietnamese are concerned, we have supported <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and they have no evidence that we have changed our
                            views. Therefore, people are reluctant to stick their necks out since
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would move against any
                            individual who did. Everyone is looking to the US and here we stand. The
                            Vietnamese do not lack the guts to move against the government once they
                            are sure of the US position.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled that we had made a number of public statements
                            condemning the Vietnamese Government's actions but this has ignited
                            nothing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName> said that we have
                            criticized the government before. What the Vietnamese people are looking
                            for is a concrete action illustrating the US position. He said that he
                            would recommend a middle course of action—a series of moves in a
                            psychological and political warfare campaign to isolate the Nhus and
                            destroy the current impression that they were all-powerful. Most
                            Vietnamese would like to see President Diem remain but they are
                            unalterably opposed to the Nhus. In <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName>' judgment, we cannot win the war if the Nhus
                            remain. He has this from <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>,
                            from <persName corresp="#p_LAC1">Lac</persName>, the Vietnamese head of
                            the strategic hamlet program, and from many military officers whom he
                            has known over the years. All of them have come reluctantly to this
                            conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName> said that we need a
                            man to guide and operate a campaign to isolate the Nhus and to convince
                            the government and people that the US will not support a government with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> in it, thus encouraging
                            the military to do the job if Diem won't come around. He thinks there is
                            one man who could guide and operate this campaign as a special assistant
                            to the Ambassador and it was <persName corresp="#p_LMGEG1">Ed
                                Lansdale</persName>.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName> said that with all
                            due respect to General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName>'s
                            report, the US military advisers were not able to give credible evidence
                            on political attitudes. They were under a direction not to talk politics
                            with their Vietnamese counterparts and their Vietnamese counterparts
                            knew of this and were reluctant to talk over politics with the American
                            military. It was only with old American friends that they would discuss
                            such matters.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what specific steps Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName> would recommend. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName> said first he would cut aid to
                                <persName corresp="#p_LQTC1">Colonel Tung</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName>
                            could not redirect other aid into his special units. <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName> said that we could go direct
                            to the field, that <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> could
                            get some help from the President but our cutting aid to <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> would have important political
                            and psychological effects throughout Viet-Nam illustrating that we
                            disapproved of <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and what they stood
                            for.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName> suggested another
                            specific step would be to cut aid to the Motion Picture Center which is
                            now processing films laudatory of the Nhus. Another step was that in the
                            approving of any new request for aid we should require a signed
                            statement that it was not to be used for repression and to build up the
                            Nhus.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that it would be hard to get a signed statement
                            with the latter phrase.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName> also suggested covert
                            action to split <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> and Col.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> and to discredit
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> asked what the
                            result of all this would be. Would it be military action against the
                            Nhus? Military action against the Government? Or decision by the Nhus
                            that they have had it? What would be the result? Civil war or a quiet
                            palace revolution? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName>
                            replied that he thought there was a good possibility of splitting
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> from the President. He
                            would expect some retaliation from <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, perhaps cutting aid programs that the US likes, but
                            the result should be that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            would lose the support of officers and civil service people who now go
                            along with him.</p>
                        <p>The President asked, “What about the possibility that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s response would be to withdraw
                            funds from the war and field to Saigon—retreating to Saigon and charging
                            publicly that the US was causing them to lose the war?” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName> said that the Army would not
                            stand still for this—too many of the Army were on the Viet Cong
                            assassination list. Furthermore, it was our money in the provinces. We
                            controlled it and the Central Government could not in fact withdraw it.
                            If worse came to worst we could take our plasters out to the provinces
                            in suitcases. We started the strategic hamlet program this way and we
                            could finish it this way.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> said that the
                            advisers were not good on politics or palace intrigue but they were good
                            on saying whether or not the war was being won and they do say that the
                            war is going well.</p>

                        <p>The President asked how these differences could be explained. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName> said that the war
                            was going well in the first, second and third corps but it was
                            emphatically not going well in the fourth corps, the Delta region. The
                            strategic hamlets are being chewed to pieces by the Viet Cong. Fifty
                            hamlets have been over-run recently. This deterioration of the war
                            effort in the Delta, however, was not connected with political
                            developments and repression of the Buddhists.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> said that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName> was putting his
                            judgment against General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' judgment and that he, <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName>, would take <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>'-the battle was not being lost in a purely
                            military sense.<note n="6" xml:id="d83fn6">

                                        Phillips</persName>, who gave a gloomy picture, stating that
                                    we were indeed losing the war, that in the Delta things were in
                                    a tragic state, that in Long An province, for example, 60% of
                                    the strategic hamlets had been overrun and that, contrary to
                                    what I had said, the military campaign was not going forward
                                    satisfactorily.</p>
                                <p>“The President asked if I cared to make a comment regarding Mr.

                                    statement respecting military progress had its origin in a
                                    reservoir of many advisors who were doing nothing other than
                                    observe the prosecution of the war; that their view was shared

                            <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName> said that he did not
                            think so; there was too much activity in the Delta. The strategic
                            hamlets are not being protected; they are being overrun wholesale.
                            Furthermore, in response to General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName> said that this was not a military war but a
                            political war. It was a war for men's minds more than battles against
                            the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName> reported as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>He concurred with <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName> and he
                            especially wanted to underline the point about the American image. We
                            are in deep trouble with politically-conscious people in Viet-Nam. The
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> has unbelievable prestige. The
                            rural hamlets are hanging on every word and living off the <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>. There is a widespread feeling of
                            appeal to the US—that we should do something. This is an unreasonable
                            attitude to look to us to solve their problems, but that's the way it
                            is. The US prestige was at stake in Viet-Nam and also in third
                            countries. He said it was an absolute certainty that the military effort
                            will be affected in time. The war had to be fought and managed by the
                            Saigon elite and the officers corps attitudes would follow the attitude
                            of the elites.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName> felt that <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName>' suggestions were inadequate.
                            He also had known Viet-Nam and the family for a decade. He thought that
                            even cutting of all aid would not do the job quickly. There would be
                            months of chaos; the government would eventually fall; but we don't know
                            what we would get in exchange. He felt that we must be ready to use US
                            combat forces; that we should start off by trying to remove the whole
                            government, including <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>,
                            since the Nhus are a symptom, not a cause. Then we might compromise and
                            let <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> stay. The President
                            asked what he thought US troops would do. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName> said that if we cut aid there would be
                            retaliation so we would have to go in as we did in Lebanon and we should
                            go in since Southeast Asia was so important to us.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State said that we should digest these reports and we
                            should especially consider what it is that has happened in July and
                            August that has changed all our views that the war could be won with the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government.</p>

                            succinctly reported. He said that there should be another meeting
                            tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>For that meeting papers should be prepared describing the specific steps
                            that we might take in a gradual and selective cut of aid, consulting the

                        <p>The President said that he was disturbed at the tendency both in
                            Washington and Saigon to fight out our own battles via the newspapers.
                            He quoted stories reflecting what seemed to be State Department views
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> must go and other
                            stories (from the Journal American) saying that the Defense Department
                            felt there had been inept diplomacy, etc. He said he wanted these
                            different views fought out at this table and not indirectly through the
                            newspapers.</p>
                        <p>The President wanted a cable to go to Saigon to the same effect, <note n="9" xml:id="d83fn9">The Department of State sent telegram 376 to

                            O'Brien. The President thought the resolution might be helpful, but what
                            would really pull the rug out from under us in Viet-Nam was if it was
                            offered and then beaten. Certainly some would attack it on the grounds
                            that we must not question a government fighting successfully against the
                            Communists. We would certainly need the support of <persName corresp="#p_MM2">Mansfield</persName> and Dirksen if our judgment

                        <p>After exchanging pleasantries, Senator <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Church</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> how soon he would be leaving on his trip. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> replied that it would
                            not be until Friday evening.<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">September
                                13.</note> He also said that he had talked with the President and
                            that it was his understanding that he (RH) was to work with him and he
                            asked for a number of copies of the proposed bill [resolution] for
                            distribution to the Secretary of State, etc. to be sent to him as soon
                            as possible. Senator <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Church</persName> said
                            that he would be happy to do this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> stated that he had two
                            thoughts in mind. One was that they had better have a pretty careful
                            explanation of its effect in Vietnam. The second was that the President
                            wanted O'Brien and <persName corresp="#p_DFG1">Dutton</persName>
                            <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0194"/>to work on this, too. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> mentioned the fact
                            that the one thing that would really “do us in” would be if the bill
                            were to be defeated. Have to be sure that it is near unanimous.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Church</persName> felt that first of
                            all it should be introduced and then go on from the kind of support
                            which develops after they know what it is all about. It seemed to him
                            that there was good prospect of getting real support. This would be
                            especially true if there were a keen feeling that it would be helpful to
                            the President and not a bill designed just to be obstructional to the
                            President. Felt that the way it should be worded would be to say that
                            the continuation of our government to support a government in South
                            Vietnam which persists in religious persecution offends the United
                            States and can not be continued.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and Maggie Higgins have
                            insisted that there is no religious persecution. But, however, he said
                            that he could assist Senator <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Church</persName> with the language.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Church</persName> felt that there was
                            a definite feeling in the world and around the Congress that there
                            definitely was religious persecution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> assured him that the statement could be
                            modified, for instance, by use of the wording “repression of
                            Buddhists.”</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Church</persName> mentioned that he
                            had sent a copy of the proposed resolution to the other senators and
                            that an introductory statement was being prepared, a copy of which he
                            would send to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3">In telegram 392 to Saigon, September 12, the
                                Department sent the Embassy a copy of the text of the proposed

                                had 22 cosponsors, but which was lying “at desk” one week to obtain

                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Church</persName> thought that the
                            situation would come up in the President's press conference on
                                Thursday.<note n="4" xml:id="d84fn4">The question did arise at the
                                President's news conference of September 12. The President agreed
                                with Senator <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Church</persName>'s view
                                that the United States should continue to assist South Vietnam. He
                                also indicated “our feeling that the assistance we give should be
                                used in the most effective way possible.” (<hi rend="italic">Public

                            undercut his own bargaining position the way he did yesterday.<note n="5" xml:id="d84fn5">Apparent reference to the President's
                                interview on the “Huntley-Brinkley Report,” September 9; text of the
                                interview is ibid., pp. 658-661. In it, the President indicated his
                                belief that reduction in U.S. aid would not be helpful “at this
                                time,” since it might affect the government structure in
                                Vietnam.</note> If he were to say that he understood this resolution
                            relates to a continuation of religious repression, which if continued
                            would make our position increasingly difficult, his bargaining lever
                            would be kept available. It was Senator <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Church</persName>'s thought that the President should <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0195"/>be fully informed along these lines.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> stated that he was
                            sure the President would be thoroughly briefed, but one couldn't promise
                            as to his actual words.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> opened the meeting by making the following
                            points:</p>
                        <p>1. He requested that each agency list all current programs being carried
                            out in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>2. He suggested the drafting in Washington of a guidance document to be
                            sent to all U.S. agency officials which would define the posture and
                            attitude to be followed by all U.S. government officials in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. He suggested that we need a document to provide press guidance for use
                            in Washington and in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. He recommended that we develop a way of controlling all U.S. messages
                            going to Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> pointed out that U.S. policy is as the
                            President has stated in his last two public statements, copies
                            attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2">See <ref target="#d50">Document 50</ref> and footnote 5, Document

                        </p>
                        <p>The Attorney General stated his view that we should now concentrate on
                            specifics. All agreed that the war would go better without <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. How much do we pay for a change? He said he did
                            not think we should discuss with the President generalities and
                            differences of view. What we should now do is to concern ourselves with
                            specific actions.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> thought we
                            ought to try to change <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s
                            policies. He believed our present policy was not viable. He thought that
                            we had been trying to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, but we had no alternative to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that he knew about. Therefore, we
                            were making it impossible to continue to work with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> on the one hand and, on the
                            other, not developing an alternative solution. He felt that we should go
                            back to what we were doing three weeks ago.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> stated
                            his flat disagreement. He said Diem had created a situation where we
                            cannot back him.<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">

                                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                                    proposed that we start with a clean slate and review the problem
                                    in terms of our objectives. To this Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said that to start
                                    with a clean slate was not permissible; that we have to operate
                                    within the public statements already made by the President; that
                                    we cannot begin afresh, overlooking the fact that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had gravely offended the
                                    world community.”</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> said that the military
                            views as represented by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> were saying that our sole objective was to win
                            the war and that we could win with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. The civilian side believed that the political
                            situation was deteriorating so rapidly in Vietnam that we must replace
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> before his eroding
                            position led to a collapse of the fight against the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>During a discussion of how we should use Congressional criticism of
                            Vietnam to advance our objectives, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said Senator <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Church</persName> would be fully responsive to suggestions as to
                            the wording of the Senate resolution and to the timing of its
                            introduction. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> pointed
                            out that we might well use Congressional criticism of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in an effort to persuade
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to change his ways, but
                            that such criticism would be reflected in the debate on the aid program,
                            which would be hard to control.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> expressed his doubt
                            that alternative leadership existed in Vietnam. He said he had heard
                            various names but he knew of no paper which listed a group which could
                            form a government strong enough to rule if <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> were
                            removed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> described a two-prong

                            the aim of forcing him to change his present policies. He acknowledged
                            that if we started down this path we would have to be prepared to
                            contemplate the use of U.S. forces on the ground in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> indicated his
                            support of the position that we should continue to work on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and revealed a reluctance to
                            contemplate the use of U.S. troops in combat in Vietnam, either against
                            the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government or against
                            the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> asked that two papers be prepared by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>, the first listing
                            our objectives in Vietnam and the second a program of pressures against
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> with the aim of forcing
                            him to meet our demands. <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0197"/>Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> was asked to prepare
                            a paper on alternative leadership. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> was asked to develop a paper recommending a
                            delay in any decision for a sufficient time for the situation to
                            ripen.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> reminded the group
                            that the policy of the U.S. was as stated by the President and that he
                            agreed with it fully. He did not believe we should discuss changing that
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> disagreed and felt that the group had an
                            obligation to the President to review the policy in the light of the
                            developing situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> disagreed as to whether we could or could not
                            achieve our objectives in Vietnam with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in control.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> asked that he be
                            relieved of writing press guidance until after tomorrow's meeting in
                            view of the fact that the guidance could not be written until our policy
                            was clear.</p>

                        <p>478. Eyes only for the Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. My best estimate of the current situation in Viet
                            Nam is:</p>
                        <p>a. That it is worsening rapidly;</p>
                        <p>b. That the time has arrived for the US to use what effective sanctions
                            it has to bring about the fall of the existing government and the
                            installation of another; and</p>
                        <p>c. That intensive study should be given by the best brains in the
                            government to all the details, procedures and variants in connection
                            with the suspension of aid.</p>
                        <p>Herewith is the background for this proposal:</p>
                        <p>1. I do not doubt the military judgment that the war in the countryside
                            is going well now. But, as one who has had long connection with the
                            military, I do doubt the value of the answers which are given by young
                            officers to direct questions by Generals—or, for that matter, by
                            Ambassadors. The urge to give an optimistic and favorable answer <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0198"/>is quite unsurmountable—and
                            understandable. I, therefore, doubt the statement often made that the
                            military are not affected by developments in Saigon and cities
                            generally.</p>
                        <p>2. The fact that Saigon is “only one-seventh” of the population does not
                            allow for the fact that there are a number of other cities and that the
                            cities in the long run must play a vital military role. For example, the
                            junior officers in the Vietnamese Army come, as they do in all
                            countries, largely from families which are educated, the so-called
                            elite. These people live largely in the cities. The evidence grows that
                            this elite is filled with hostility towards the Govt of Viet Nam,
                            consider therefore the lieutenant in the Vietnamese Army whose father
                            has probably been imprisoned; whose mother has seen her religion
                            insulted, if not persecuted, whose older brother has had an arbitrary
                            fine imposed on him—and who all hate the government with good reason.
                            Can the lieutenant be indifferent to that? Now come the high school
                            demonstrations and the fact that the lieutenant's younger brother has
                            probably been dragged off in a truck (bearing the US insignia) to
                            camping areas with the result that our lieutenant also has a deeply
                            disaffected younger brother, if not a sister, who has been handled
                            disrespectfully by the police.</p>
                        <p>3. Is it conceivable that this will not affect the energy with which the
                            lieutenant will do his job in supporting his government? Is it any
                            wonder that I hear reports of a major in the G-3 section of a corps
                            headquarters who simply sits and does nothing because he is disgusted
                            with the government? Must there not inevitably be a tendency—not for
                            something spectacular and mutinous—but for the soldiers to get less
                            aggressive and for the populations to get less sympathetic to the war
                            effort? And as this happens will not the popularity of the US inevitably
                            suffer because we are so closely supporting a regime which is now
                            brutalizing children, although we are clearly able, in the opinion of
                            Vietnamese, to change it if we wanted to?</p>
                        <p>4. Does not all of this mean that time is not on the side of the military
                            effort and that if the situation in the cities is not improved, the
                            military effort is bound to suffer?</p>
                        <p>5. But instead of improving, everything I can learn shows me that the
                            situation is getting worse. The demonstrations in the schools are to me
                            extremely curious and impressive manifestations. Out of nowhere
                            apparently appears a banner and a plan to put up a roadblock or a scheme
                            for conducting a parade. Perhaps this is the work of Communist agents,
                            even though the students are undoubtedly not Communists. The latest
                            rumor is that there will soon be similar demonstrations by civil
                            servants—and what a fantastic confusion this will create and the
                            government is obviously cut off from reality—not looking at anything
                            objectively but solely concerned with fighting back, proving how right
                            it has been-and privately thumbing its nose at the US.</p>
                        <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0199"/>
                        <p>6. For these reasons it seems to me that the ship of state here is slowly
                            sinking. This brings me to the conclusion, that if there are effective
                            sanctions which we can apply, we should apply them in order to force a
                            drastic change in government. The only sanction which I can see is the
                            suspension of aid and therefore I recommend that the best brains in the
                            government study precise details of suspending aid so as to do ourselves
                            the most good and the least harm.</p>
                        <p>7. Let us, for example, assume that our aim is to get rid of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. I use this purely for illustrative
                            purposes, as we may think of something better. Once we have made up our
                            minds that we are willing to suspend aid, should we not make a private
                            threat that unless <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was
                            removed we would suspend aid? This procedure might have two advantages:
                            First it might result in <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s
                            being removed. But, secondly, it would seem to put us on the popular
                            side of the question and would then, when news of it leaked, tend to
                            separate the government from the people. Also, when the tremendous shock
                            of aid suspension took place, it should lessen the hatred which would be
                            visited on us. This should be a period of action with perhaps a few
                            leaks and with a minimum of statements by us—certainly not
                            emotion-stirring statements which would arouse the xenophobia which is
                            always latent here and the arousing of which would strengthen the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. We might, for example, be able to
                            express our horror at the brutalization of children, but even this is
                            risky if we are the ones who are doing the talking.</p>
                        <p>8. Renewed efforts should be made to activate by whatever positive
                            inducements we can offer the man who would take over the government—Big
                            Minh or whoever we might suggest. We do not want to substitute a Castro
                            for a Batista.</p>
                        <p>9. We should at the same time start evacuation of all dependents. Both in
                            order to avoid the dangers to dependents which would inevitably ensue,
                            but also for the startling effect which this might have.</p>
                        <p>10. As the aid suspension went publicly into effect, we should be
                            prepared to launch a massive program to protect the lives of the little
                            people in the cities from starvation. Should this be soup kitchens, or
                            should it mean taking anti-inflationary measures?</p>
                        <p>11. As aid suspension went into effect publicly, should we not start
                            another quiet program to keep the Army supplied so that the war against
                            the Viet-Cong should go on? Should not the Army be supplied by totally
                            bypassing the Govt of Viet Nam, with supplies coming directly from the
                            US to the Vietnamese Army?</p>
                        <p>12. Might we not thus bring sanctions to bear on the government without
                            impeding the war effort and without making ourselves hated all over the
                            world, as would be the case were there famines and misery?</p>
                        <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0200"/>
                        <p>13. Admittedly this is difficult and intricate and perhaps impossible,
                            but it is also utterly vital and I recommend that it be studied without
                            delay. We are giving it as much study as we can here in the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>14. If we decide to wait and see, we run certain risks:</p>
                        <p>a. That the future leadership of Viet Nam, the educated classes—already
                            completely out of sympathy with the regime, and disillusioned with and
                            distrustful of us as the instruments of change—will lose heart. (For
                            while waiting we shall have to resume the rose of supporters of the
                            regime.)</p>
                        <p>b. More importantly, those individuals whom the regime regards as
                            proximate threats will be systematically eliminated from contention in
                            one way or another.</p>
                        <p>In short, by a wait-and-see approach, we insure that when and if we
                            decide that we cannot win with the present regime, we shall have even
                            less to work with in terms of opposition than we have now.</p>
                        <p>What is even more dangerous is that the situation here may not wait for
                            us. The student demonstrations in Saigon, for example, are profoundly
                            disturbing. At the very least, these reflect in the most unmistakable
                            way the deep discontent of the middle and upper-class population of
                            Saigon. They are also the classic vehicle for Communist action. There is
                            thus the real possibility of the situation getting out of hand in such a
                            way that only the Communists will be in a position to act—when and if we
                            decide that we cannot win with this regime.</p>

                            added that this would surely lead the President to calling a meeting on

                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> was visibly disturbed by
                            the way things are going in Vietnam and, in a revelation one seldom
                            sees, seemed at a loss about what to do. When asked if he had seen the
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Reston</persName> article in today's
                            paper (attached),<note n="3" xml:id="d87fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">James Reston</persName>'s article
                                appeared in <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> September 11.
                                It was entitled “On Suppressing the News Instead of the Nhus.” It
                                had as its central premise that the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government was doing the American public a
                                disservice by censoring American correspondents in Vietnam.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Reston</persName> also charged the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> administration
                                with clumsiness in handling the crisis. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Reston</persName> suggested that the President should insist
                                that the American-supplied equipment not be used against Buddhists
                                and that the administration provide more information about the
                                    <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s role in Saigon. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Reston</persName>, however, did state that
                                proposed congressional plans to cut off aid so long as <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> remained in power would lead
                                to a “loss of the Vietnamese peninsula and more.”</note> he said
                            that he had, that he had talked with <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Reston</persName> yesterday, but had batted only about .213 on that
                            particular item. He later said that at least <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Reston</persName> supported continuing the war in the article,
                            which he did not do at the beginning of the discussion yesterday.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Reston</persName> article led to a general
                            discussion of newspaper treatment of the situation on Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> remarked that, under the
                            circumstances, he thought the newspaper treatment had been mild; it
                            could legitimately have been much worse. He remarked that someone in the
                            State Department had been talking to Tad Szulc, who was writing
                            inaccurate reports. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName>
                            said that he didn't know who it was, but that Szulc was particularly
                            unreliable. <persName corresp="#p_SAJ1">Schlesinger</persName>, back
                            since yesterday, dissented and said that Szulc actually had a sound
                            base, but just did some “imaginative extrapolation.” After laughter died
                            down, this led to a discussion about how to handle bright young
                            reporters who “extrapolated.” <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Carl
                                Kaysen</persName>, down on a consultant status, said he believed it
                            was preferable to give them a line for their story rather than have them
                            go off half-cocked in the wrong direction. The matter was left up in the
                            air there.</p>
                        <p>About this point, <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Bromley Smith</persName>
                            brought in a ticker tape that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s brother, Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_NDT1">Ngo Dinh Thuc</persName>, was coming to the United States, having
                            left Rome today. The purpose of his visit will be to make arrangements
                            for Madam <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s visit. Already
                            wobbly, this was close to the last blow for <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>, who said that this was the first time the world
                            had been faced with collective madness in a ruling family since the days
                            of the czars. <persName corresp="#p_DRA1">Ralph Dungan</persName> said
                            that, if the Pope was peeved with the Archbishop, Cardinal Spellman
                            would undoubtedly put him under wraps in New York.</p>

                        <p>U.S. Policy in Viet-Nam since the 1954 partition of the country by the
                            Geneva Agreements has been directed toward the securing and maintenance
                            of a strong, viable and free South Viet-Nam capable of resisting
                            Communist aggression with U.S. assistance and support.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II. Broad U.S. Objective in Current Situation</p>
                        <p>The U.S. policy objective should continue to be the maintenance of a
                            viable, strong and free area in South Viet-Nam capable of maintaining
                            its independence, successfully resisting Communist aggression, and
                            susceptible to U.S. influence.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Prerequisite</hi>: To achieve this objective South
                            Viet-Nam must have a regime and government capable of drawing sufficient
                            popular support in the broad mass of the population and that degree of
                            support in the Vietnamese elites required for the effective and dynamic
                            communication of leadership to the masses of the population. Vietnamese
                            leadership must be basically responsive to the burden of aspirations of
                            the people as a whole.</p>

                        <p>Similarly, Dr. Pham Huy Quat, and Vu Quoc Thuc should be given

                        <p>5. [<hi rend="italic">4.</hi>] These are not impossible demands since
                            none of the civilians mentioned are open opponents of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime and the generals have thus

                        <p>These changes would further convey the changing character of the now

                            </hi>.</p>
                        <p>1. There should be a clearly announced policy statement made to the
                            National Assembly convoked in extraordinary session reversing current
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> repressive policies.</p>
                        <p>Specifically: (a) All those arrested as a result of recent events should
                            be released without penalty, and thoroughly amnestied.</p>
                        <p>(b) Martial law should be revoked and press censorship removed.</p>
                        <p>(c) A joint statement of reconciliation should be negotiated by <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> as Acting Prime Minister between
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and a reconstituted
                            committee of the real bonzes. These do not need to include <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> but should include at least
                            Thich Thien Khiet, Mai Tho Truyen and Thich Thien Minh.</p>
                        <p>The joint statement should include provision for reconstitution for all
                            damage and indemnification of all victims as can be agreed.</p>
                        <p>(d) Decree Law No. 10 should be repealed immediately by executive action
                            subject to confirmation by vote of the National Assembly at its
                            extraordinary session.</p>
                        <p>(e) <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> should make a unilateral
                            statement of explanation for the policies of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> since May 8 to the extraordinary session of the
                            National Assembly.</p>

                        <p>(f) The same statement should schedule new elections to be held at a
                            defined date and should give his guarantee that such elections will be
                            held in full and complete freedom.</p>
                        <p>(g) The entire statement to the National Assembly, and proposals made
                            therein should be subject to vote of confidence by the Assembly or
                            covered by Assembly resolution expressing such confidence.</p>

                        <p>Subject to the above we should tell <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that we are ready to prosecute our program to
                            annihilate the Viet Cong menace with renewed vigor and that we expect
                            full cooperation from him in this endeavor.</p>
                        <p>We should undertake in agreement with him to assist in the quiet removal
                            from Viet-Nam of certain persons, both official and private, presently

                        <p>1. The purpose of this memorandum is to analyze some of the favorable and
                            adverse consequences of a U.S. policy toward South Vietnam which would
                            involve the minimum of change in our current relationships with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. It is assumed that under such
                            an approach we would continue to press the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, both publicly and privately, for the kinds of changes
                            in policy which we have already recommended to them. We would attempt to
                            maintain and improve our normal contacts with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> at all levels and avoid taking any
                            “incorrect” actions. We would not make any significant changes in our
                            aid policy. We would try to maintain a balance in our public posture
                            between expressions of disapproval of specific repressive actions of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and support for Vietnam in its
                            struggle against the Communists.</p>
                        <p>2. The following are some of the principal arguments in favor of such a
                            policy:</p>
                        <p>(a) There is a possibility that a hands-off approach by the United States
                            to the internal politics of South Vietnam would permit the natural
                            political forces within the country to achieve their own solution. The
                            United States would not be involved in the replacement of the present
                            government nor in the selection of a new one, with the result that a new
                            government would not be stigmatized as a U.S. puppet. It is also
                            possible that once it became clear that the United States would not
                            involve itself, local leaders (both civilian and military), who up to
                            now have been unwilling or unable to act, would accept the fact that
                            initiative for change would have to come from themselves. If it is true
                            that the political situation in Saigon will continue to deteriorate, the
                            pressures for such local action should build up.</p>
                        <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0208"/>
                        <p>(b) A decision not to use economic sanctions would, of course, avoid the
                            disruptive effects of a suspension of U.S. aid. The war effort in the
                            countryside, at least, in its material aspects, would not be disturbed;
                            and we would not add to the confusion in the cities by triggering a
                            possible runaway inflation.</p>
                        <p>(c) Although we have already discovered that there is a disinclination
                            among senior military leaders to take any action in the present
                            circumstance, it would seem likely that as conditions within the country
                            became more chaotic, they would be forced to take collective action. It
                            has been suggested that since the military stand the most to lose in the
                            event of a Communist take-over, their self-interest will eventually
                            force them to work for a change in the government. To the extent that
                            military aid continues uninterrupted, they will not be denied the
                            resources to effect a change, and their attitude toward the United
                            States should not worsen.</p>
                        <p>(d) Despite the voices in the United States which would be critical of
                            such a policy, a recent analysis by the Department of State of editorial
                            opinion in the newspapers<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">American Opinion
                                Summary, prepared by the Public Opinion Studies Staff, Bureau of
                                Public Affairs, dated September 10. (National Archives and Records
                                Administration, RG 59: Office of Public Opinion Studies, “U.S.
                                Policy on S. Vietnam, April-Dec. 1963”)</note> suggests that—at
                            present at least—there is a fairly even division over the question of
                            whether we should get tough or ride it out. In any event, the suggested
                            policy will be justified by whether or not it succeeds in producing the
                            desired changes in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policy and
                            personnel. Thus, the real question is whether U.S. domestic opinion will
                            allow us sufficient time to determine whether the Vietnamese can solve
                            their own problems. On this question we are in the best position to make
                            a sound judgment.</p>
                        <p>(e) The same comment would presumably apply to world opinion; and to the
                            extent that the pressure of domestic U.S. and world opinion can be
                            brought to bear on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, U.S.
                            interests would seem to be furthered. Reiteration of our disapproval of
                            the repressive actions of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government would, for a time at least, preserve the
                            U.S. from complete identification with the unpopular acts of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(f) One of the most attractive factors in the suggested policy is that it
                            tends to preserve a wider range of options open to us. If our objectives
                            are not achieved after a reasonable period of time, or if the situation
                            deteriorates to a point where hard evidence indicates that an eventual
                            collapse of the war effort is certain, we should still be able to move
                            up the scale and adopt more aggressive tactics. On the other hand, once
                            we embark on a program of graduated sanctions, turning back would not
                            seem feasible.</p>
                        <p>3. Some of the adverse consequences of the suggested policy can be
                            summarized as follows:</p>
                        <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0209"/>
                        <p>(a) A fundamental assumption has to be made that there is sufficient time
                            to permit all of the internal and external pressures upon the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to change its policies and personnel to
                            crystallize and produce remedial action. We do not have the kind of hard
                            evidence that enables us to predict with any accuracy whether there is
                            enough time. We do not know whether the structure of the civilian
                            government and the military in South Vietnam would hold together long
                            enough while local initiative for change takes effect.</p>
                        <p>(b) We also do not know what the alternatives are as they appear to the
                            Vietnamese themselves. It is possible that instead of reacting to
                            continued political deterioration in a positive manner, the educated
                            civilian segment of the society might relapse into complete apathy, or
                            worse, turn secretly in the direction of the Viet Cong. As for the
                            military, there also is a lack of information on their physical ability
                            to pull themselves together in the midst of the disintegrating
                            situation. Can, for example, commanders outside of Saigon communicate
                            independently and effectively with each other?</p>
                        <p>(c) Another obvious problem would be the degree of influence, if any,
                            which the U.S. could have in the formation of a new government should a
                            local initiative crystallize. Despite our public condemnation of
                            repression, there might remain sufficient hostility to the United States
                            among Vietnamese leaders to make it difficult for us to communicate
                            effectively with them. Some of this disadvantage might be avoided if we
                            were to maintain covert contact with the leaders of local coup groups.
                            This would probably be easier to do in the case of military leaders than
                            in the case of civilians, although we have some evidence that even the
                            former are becoming less willing to talk with us.</p>
                        <p>(d) Although we are probably on reasonably sure ground in assessing our
                            ability to weather domestic U.S. criticism of the suggested policy, we
                            may not be able to assess foreign reaction with the same certainty. It
                            is possible, for example, that a number of Governments, including some
                            friendly ones, would begin pressuring for a Laotian-type solution in
                            Vietnam. Our ability to maintain the American presence there might be
                            seriously compromised if international pressures for the neutralization
                            of South Vietnam got out of hand.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s statement of
                            August 29<note n="2" xml:id="d92fn2">See <ref target="#d26fn7">footnote
                                    7, Document 26</ref>.</note> reflects his long-standing belief
                            that neutralization of Southeast Asia is inevitable and desirable.
                            However, neither his words nor reports of French diplomatic activity in
                            Saigon indicate any clear and imminent intention of moving to bring this
                            about in South Vietnam. Nonetheless, his statement and these reports
                            provide a basis for <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>
                            to threaten, directly or indirectly, that clandestine contacts between
                            Saigon and Hanoi might arrange a settlement contrary to United States
                            interests. This threat may be merely a bluff to reduce United States
                            pressures upon <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>; should it go
                            further <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would probably stop
                            such activity well short of any deal with Ho Chi Minh. Hanoi, however,
                            would attempt to encourage such contacts if only to exploit
                            contradictions within the non-Communist camp. Conceivably the mixture of
                            truth and rumor, contrived and accidental, could bring about diplomatic
                            pressures for an international conference on Vietnam. Soviet Russia
                            might back such a move; Communist China would reluctantly go along if it
                            thought this could force a withdrawal of the United States from South
                            Vietnam.</p>

                            He said those in Saigon were in the center of developments, and as a
                            result, felt strongly about what they thought ought to be done. He
                            recalled that the U.S., over the past years, had gained considerable
                            experience in dealing with individuals who, in effect, controlled their
                            governments, i.e. Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, etc. From the
                            Washington viewpoint, what was happening in Saigon was not a new
                            situation. He felt that it was most important for us here to be clear as
                            to what our objectives are in Vietnam. He thought we ought to try to
                            define the perimeters of our problems. The U.S. came back into Vietnam
                            in a major way in 1959 in response to an intensified Viet Cong campaign.
                            If U.S. presence is not needed now, we should leave, but we want to
                            leave behind an independent Vietnam. We cannot leave if to do so
                            consists of abandoning Vietnam to the Viet Cong. At the other extreme,
                            we do not want to apply U.S. force because, if we introduce U.S. troops,
                            we will have resumed the situation in Vietnam to that which existed when
                            the French were fighting a colonial war there. He said <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> probably has to go, but this did
                            not mean that we had to turn against <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. It is possible for us to work with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. Possibly we can persuade
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to separate from
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. Maybe we can't, but as
                            of now, we don't know whether we can force <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to exile <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> so far has not been able to break through to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and to conduct
                            meaningful conversations. We do not underestimate the capacity of
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to pull the temple down around
                            their heads and ours if they won't buy what we demand. It is possible
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> may turn to the northern
                            Vietnamese and make a deal with them if he concludes that <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0212"/>he cannot accept our requirements. As
                            to the reports we receive of U.S. citizens' conversations with their
                            Vietnamese friends, he doubted that when the fate of a nation is at
                            stake we should put very much reliance on what the Vietnamese tell their
                            American friends.</p>
                        <p>Turning to a draft paper outlining U.S. objectives in South Vietnam (copy
                                attached),<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3">Not attached, but see <ref target="#d89">Document 89</ref>.</note> he expressed doubt that
                            we should cut back U.S. aid which is essential to the war effort in
                            Vietnam or reduce aid which benefits the Vietnamese people. He
                            acknowledged the difficulty of finding pressures which we could use
                            which actually bite into the Diem government.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> recommended that the
                            next step consists of instructing Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> to wrestle with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in an effort to prompt <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to make changes in the government
                            we feel are essential if the war effort is to succeed. He pointed out
                            that the degree of urgency should be thought of in terms of weeks. We
                            are not in a hurry in terms of the coming days. His comment referred to
                            a sentence in the objectives paper which states that our judgment is
                            that there is a time urgency.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> reported that the
                            Defense Department had looked closely at our entire military assistance
                            program to Vietnam and concluded that to suspend any part of it would
                            mean an immediate halt to the war effort in Vietnam. This is true in
                            part because our assistance covers spare parts and ammunition.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> continued his
                            general remarks by recalling a situation on Mainland China during the
                            time when Chiang Kai-shek was encountering dissidence and opposition.
                            The U.S. had decided to terminate its support to China, stepped out of
                            the Chinese picture, and the Communist Mao took over. He saw
                            similarities in the Vietnamese situation and argued that we must not
                            yield to the temptation of despairing of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and act in a way which would result in the
                            Communists taking Vietnam. There are several alternatives yet available
                            to us before we have to choose between getting out or sending in U.S.
                            combat troops. If we do go in with U.S. combat troops, the Vietnamese
                            will turn against us. Perhaps we should offer to assist <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in finding out whether the Viet
                            Cong was responsible for instigating the student riots.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> supported
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s comments by
                            urging that we look at what is happening in Vietnam in historical
                            perspective. He asked who would organize a religious, political movement
                            in opposition to an existing government during a time when that
                            government was fighting a civil war. He said he doubted that Lincoln,
                            during the Civil War, would have acted in a way to meet the protests of
                            a religious, political movement.</p>
                        <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0213"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> expressed his belief
                            that both political and religious factors were involved in the Buddhist
                            demonstrations. He speculated that the protest may have started in Hue
                            as a religious protest, which later became a political protest.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said we had never
                            accused the Vietnamese of religious persecution, but only religious
                            oppression.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> turned to his
                            thought of asking how actions are to be evaluated when they take place
                            in the midst of a civil war. He believed that there had been some
                            penetration by the Viet Cong of the Buddhists who had staged the
                            demonstrations. He suggested that to clarify our thinking we should
                            separate those things we must have from those things we would like to
                            have from <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said he liked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s sense of timing, i.e., that we do
                            not reach a crisis within days, but rather within weeks.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> advocated that we
                            avoid pin pricks which serve to annoy <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. He recommended that in conversations with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> we be serious and tell
                            him the things that he must do if he is to continue to receive help from
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> said Defense favored
                            a suggestion that had been made to evacuate all U.S. dependents from
                            Vietnam as a way of indicating to Diem how seriously we felt about the
                            changes we were asking him to make. Both Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            shared this view.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said we should start pressures against
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. We are not sure these
                            pressures will be effective, but we can begin now to contain <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s power. If <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s power continues to ascend in the
                            way it has in the past few weeks, and if <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> continues to carry out his ideas of how to govern
                            Vietnam, we cannot win the war against the Communists.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that the
                            removal of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would be the
                            symbol of a reconciliation by Diem with the Vietnamese people and with
                            the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> called attention to
                            his paper entitled “A Plan to Achieve U.S. Objectives in South Vietnam,”
                            copy attached.<note n="4" xml:id="d93fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName>'s record of this
                                meeting makes it clear that <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> is referring to early drafts of his
                                “Reconciliation” and “Pressures and Persuasions” track papers. For
                                the drafts as printed, see attachments to <ref target="#d114">Document 114</ref>. <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName>'s record reads as follows: <p>“The Group then
                                    studied the draft program prepared by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>. Mr.
                                        <persName>Bundy</persName> made the point that the paper was
                                    too much in reliance on the press and on press leaks. General
                                        <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> stated that
                                    the proposed Phase I actions would not get rid of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> if suasion failed. Mr.
                                        <persName>Bundy</persName> agreed with this, saying that we
                                    are not going to get rid of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> by putting out black newspapers. He does,
                                    however, like the idea of threatening the evacuation of
                                    dependents on the basis of pure risk to their well being.”</p>
                            </note> He said this plan was merely a concept, but it did have specific
                            courses of action which illustrated how the concept would become
                            reality.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> returned to the
                            question of urgency. In his view, there is none. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> commented that this time
                            reference involved weeks and months. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said the Agency estimated we would have a grace
                            period of three months before there was real trouble.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General asked whether any estimate had ever been made as to
                            how <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would react if we said
                            he must do certain specified things or we would withdraw from Vietnam.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said no such estimate
                            had been made. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>
                            recalled that some believed <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            would pull the house down around him in reaction to an ultimatum.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that former
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> believed that
                            if we made clear to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that
                            Congress might force us to drastically reduce aid, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> might yield.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said we might withdraw
                            aid to Colonel Tung's Special Forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> replied that this could not be done. Aid to the
                            Special Forces was so interlaced that we could not stop some forms of
                            aid without affecting others. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> also doubted there would be any way in which we
                            could withhold support from Colonel Tung alone. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> repeated his view that he
                            believed such action was possible.</p>
                        <p>The group turned to a discussion of a Congressional resolution proposed
                            by Senator Church. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            was concerned that our support of such a resolution might get out of
                            control. He predicted that Senators who are opposed to aid would vote
                            for us along with those who would use the withdrawal of aid as a
                            sanction to force <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to change
                            his method of governing. He agreed that we should encourage Senators to
                            sound off, but was not enthusiastic about voting a specific resolution.
                            Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> commented that the plan proposed by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> put too much weight
                            on press policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName>
                            agreed. He recommended that we not leak our decisions to the press, as
                            recommended in the plan, but make formal, precise announcements.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> commented that the
                            plan would not overcome <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> if he
                            chose to resist.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> suggested we could tell <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that we are cutting all links to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and thus isolate
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. We would give assistance
                            for the prosecution of the war, but not through <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_LQTC1">Colonel Tung</persName>. He did not favor the use of black press
                            stories.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_LQTC1">Colonel
                                Tung</persName> was a nonentity. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> asked then why we should hit him. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> responded that we were seeking
                            to attack <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> through <persName corresp="#p_LQTC1">Colonel Tung</persName>.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked whether the
                            objective of the plan is to reduce the influence of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> or eliminate him. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> responded that the courses of
                            action recommended in the plan will have very <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0215"/>limited material effect, but those who
                            are expert in Vietnamese affairs say that the actions proposed will have
                            a profound psychological effect.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked what we do
                            if the plan fails. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said we need not look
                            at the plan in such black and white terms. He said we could live with an
                            interim target for months. We could decide later if we had to take more
                            drastic action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said one objective was
                            to take actions, plus words, to disassociate the U.S. government from
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. The report is still
                            circulating in Saigon that we fully support <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. If we succeeded in disassociating ourselves from
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, this may result in his
                            removal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said a good case could be made for
                            continuing U.S. aid, but he suggested that we should build up our own
                            distribution system so that if we wish to redirect our aid we would have
                            a capability of doing so. We do not now have this capability because our
                            aid is distributed by the Vietnamese. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JSJ1">Janow</persName> replied by saying that we cannot take over the
                            distribution of our aid. The system is so built that it will defeat the
                            objective of phase one actions. He pointed out that we must decide soon
                            on what we are going to do about several major pending issues, the
                            biggest one being whether we go forward or not with a new <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 agreement. If we do, and if we take
                            other big aid steps, the small actions suggested in phase one will be
                            ineffective.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s base is wider than <persName corresp="#p_LQTC1">Colonel Tung</persName>'s Special Forces. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said the steps in his
                            plan were not aimed at achieving a material effect, but rather at
                            creating a psychological effect while continuing to support the war
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said no one could estimate whether the
                            plan would succeed or not. He said he saw no serious objection in an
                            effort to break the tie between <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that the next
                            step is another attack on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. He said we
                            should review the bidding for the past eight years. Then we should call
                            attention to what has happened in the last few months. We could then
                            explain to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that we were
                            behind him in his effort to win the war, but that the actions of the
                            last few months would have to be dealt with in a way which would
                            increase his public support.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> then read extracts from a paper prepared
                            by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName>
                            <note n="5" xml:id="d93fn5">Not found, but Colby describes this paper in

                                it was “clearly out of tune with the Administration's

                                earlier.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">See <ref target="#d93">Document
                                    93</ref>.</note> He emphasized that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has become a symbol which has to be removed.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> hasn't yet
                            gotten through to Diem. We cannot assume that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will not move in our direction.
                            On the other hand, if we move against Diem too fast, we cannot dismiss
                            the possibility that he might bring the Vietnamese house down around him
                            and go to North Vietnam for assistance, possibly with help from the
                            French. He cautioned against reacting to people in the field who want to
                            get on with the job and are frustrated by the problem. He referred to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>'s plan which he said
                            did not involve really important actions, but would have an important
                            psychological effect. He recommended that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> be told to tell <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to start acting like the
                            President of Vietnam and get on with the war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> briefly summarized the
                            concept of the draft plan. <note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">See <ref target="#d93fn4">footnote 4, Document 93</ref>.</note>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> pointed out that the differences between
                            the <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> plan and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s view is that the
                            latter is asking for suspension of aid. It turns out that it is not easy
                            to cut U.S. aid without stopping the war effort.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> added that cutting
                            U.S. military aid would have an immediate and telling effect on the war
                            effort. Most of our aid involves airplanes. We could, however, withdraw
                            dependents without hurting the war effort.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether deterioration has set in and whether the
                            situation is serious. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                            replied that within three months the situation may become serious.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we could
                            not estimate whether the situation would become serious in three months.
                            He said there had been as yet no serious effect on the war effort.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> wants action on
                            aid, wants to oust <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, and is
                            thinking of a new coup. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> is opposed and he agrees that we should take no
                            hurried action.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said he doubted
                            we could get in real touch with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. We cannot count on doing so, but we must make the
                            effort. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said he agreed
                            with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that we should
                            proceed cautiously. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> has not been there very long. He should see the
                            country rather than merely Saigon. We cannot cut our aid to <persName corresp="#p_LQTC1">Colonel Tung</persName> without jeopardizing the
                            entire counterinsurgency movement in the northern part of South Vietnam.
                            This would be the cost of creating pressures in Saigon on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. We should make another approach
                            to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>At this point the President read the ticker report of Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s interview with reporters in
                            Belgrade (copy attached).<note n="4" xml:id="d94fn4">Not attached. In
                                Belgrade attending the Interparliamentary Union, Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> stated on September 11 that
                                “President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> is a
                                politician, and when he hears a loud opinion speaking in a certain
                                way, he tries to appease it somehow”. She continued: “if that
                                opinion is misinformed, the solution is not to bow to it, but the
                                solution should be to inform.” (Quoted in Sobel, ea., <hi rend="italic">South Vietnam</hi>, 1961-65, vol. I, p. 67)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> commented that the worse Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> becomes the easier it is to argue
                            that she must get out of the Vietnamese government.</p>
                        <p>The President felt that some reply was called for. How could we continue
                            to have her making anti-American comments at the same time she is one of
                            the leaders of a government we are supporting?</p>
                        <p>The President asked for a paper containing details of the plan suggested
                            by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>. He wanted to see
                            the interrelationships of the various proposed courses of action. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> responded that his
                            paper was merely a concept and that proposed courses of action were
                            illustrative of how it might be put into effect.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> suggested that another
                            approach be made to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. He
                            believed that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> official <persName corresp="#p_RJH1">Richardson</persName> in Saigon should not now
                            talk to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. He suggested that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName>, who knows <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, be sent from Washington to Saigon
                            to talk to him.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether a draft letter to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had been prepared for him as he
                            had suggested. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> replied that it was felt
                            that a letter from the President to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> asking <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            to silence <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> would be
                            difficult to write because it dealt with what, in effect, was a family
                            matter. In addition, if the letter became public, the complications
                            might be serious. It was felt that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> should be instructed to ask
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> orally to silence
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President said his idea of a letter was to spell out our general view
                            toward the situation faced by <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. This is one method of getting Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> going on his conversations with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. The letter would not
                            be released to the press. He asked that a draft of our concerns and our
                            complaints be prepared for him. As to a Congressional resolution, he
                            thought it would be helpful, but only if we could control the ensuing
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said we could support the introduction of
                            the resolution and then suggest that it not be acted upon in a hurry.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_MM2">Mansfield</persName> shared the view that
                            the resolution should be introduced, but that hearings on it be
                            delayed.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed his concern that an effort would be made to
                            attach the resolution to the aid bill. He wanted us to work with the
                            Congressional Committees so that we would not end up with a resolution
                            requiring that we reduce aid. The objective was a resolution merely
                            condemning current actions of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government. We must not get into a situation in
                            which the resolution could be defeated. We should try to avoid having it
                            tied to the aid program.</p>
                        <p>The President said we need to send an instruction to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, including in that instruction a
                            request that he attempt to hush up the press in Saigon.<note n="5" xml:id="d94fn5">Telegram 387 to Saigon, September 11, 9- p.m., from

                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> pointed out that we should start now
                            contingency planning for the evacuation of U.S. dependents. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed. Some 5000
                            dependents are involved and Defense is responsible for moving them. He
                            felt that evacuation of dependents is a very definite signal to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. In addition, he has
                            been concerned about our capability to remove dependents in a crisis
                            situation and favors removing them before any disorders break out. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> suggested that we
                            announce the intention to evacuate dependents rather than leak it <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0219"/>to the press. He pointed out
                            that evacuation risks the possibility that the world will conclude that
                            we are taking the first step toward pulling out of Vietnam. He said,
                            however, we have to take this risk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said we would, of course, have to consult
                            Congressional leaders before ordering dependents to leave. What we
                            should do was make our in-house preparations, but not decide now to
                            remove dependents. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> added that we should withdraw the dependents in a
                            way which would produce action from <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President said we should tell Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> that we are considering his cable. He believed
                            that we should express our concerns to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and get a response from him. He agreed that for the
                            next few days all aid decisions should be held up.</p>

                            dependents-but let's stop there unless we're going to give up <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>, and we must never do that. The battle
                            here is not lost by any manner of means. In fact it's being won. I think
                            we must all realize we are fighting a ruthless, crude, brutal enemy who
                            is using every known trick in the Communist bag. In 1960 he saw he was
                            losing the initial round so he openly flexed his biceps. Our tremendous
                            effort of the past year and one half began to pay off early this year
                            and he saw he was losing the military battle. In seeking a new approach
                            he seized the religious one. Bonze Quang, the culprit we now are giving
                            asylum to in our Embassy, has admitted in conversations since he entered
                            his safe haven that he had been planning to go full out against the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime prior to May
                            8th. He seized upon this episode as his opportunity. Though the
                            government made concessions, <persName>Quang</persName> and his cohorts
                            refused to accept them, always demanding more. He remained unable to
                            unseat <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. The 21st of August
                            crackdown stopped the outward religious effort, and now the school
                            children. This of course is another well organized covertly led
                            Communist trick. And a tough one to handle-but another must. We have
                            chosen to fight Communist aggression here in Southeast Asia; and we must
                            be prepared to meet <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0221"/>its every
                            form at every crossroad. This we are doing. If we fail here it will only
                            mean the pattern of failure to come. We're stronger physically,
                            mentally, and morally than the enemy. We must be stronger in our will,
                            determination, and sacrifice. No we haven't lost this one by a long shot
                            and we must not take counsel in our fears. Perhaps some of the tools are
                            tired and worn-having been practically at war since 1945 they must be.
                            So it's another must for us to sharpen the cutting edges of the old or
                            come up with some new, and get on with the offensive. “Amen”.</p>

                        <p>Eyes only for Ambassador from Secretary. Following are some of my
                            thoughts against the background of the voluminous and most helpful
                            information coming from you and country team.</p>
                        <p>1. Although situation in Saigon is understandably intensive preoccupation
                            of those who have been carrying such a heavy load for us under difficult
                            and dangerous circumstances, this is not first time that the US
                            Government has been confronted with far-reaching issues affecting vital
                            interests in a country whose leadership stubbornly resists measures
                            which we consider necessary to achieve desired results. One thinks of
                            Chiang Kai-shek on the mainland, Syngman Rhee, <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>, Nasser, Mossadegh and
                            others.</p>
                        <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0223"/>
                        <p>2. Our central objective remains a secure and independent South Viet-Nam
                            even though, at some future date, it may be possible to consider a free,
                            independent and non-communist unified country. This central objective
                            was what brought us into South Viet-Nam and its achievement is the
                            condition for our leaving. No one would be happier than we to leave
                            under that circumstance.</p>
                        <p>3. It seems to me that there are outer limits of policy within which we
                            must therefore operate unless the situation forces us to break through
                            those limits. One would be that we do not get out and turn South
                            Viet-Nam over to the Viet-Cong. The other would be that we do not use
                            large-scale forces to occupy the country and run it ourselves.</p>
                        <p>4. The key question is what has gone wrong to block or reverse the
                            favorable developments of the first six months of this year when we were
                            beginning to feel that a corner had been turned and that we could
                            anticipate a successful conclusion. The central fact appears to be that
                            the political solidarity of the Vietnamese, notably that of the elite
                            and leadership groups, has disintegrated under the impact of the
                            Buddhist problem, press policy, student and intellectual disaffection,
                            and increasing fears and distrust within the leadership itself. This
                            seriously negative development seems to be geared to brother and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> and in the process
                            the position of President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            has been weakened politically at home, overseas, and more specifically
                            with our Congress and public opinion. The two Nhus seem clearly to be at
                            the heart of the problem both on the merits and symbolically at home and
                            abroad.</p>
                        <p>5. I agree fully with your sense of urgency which I am inclined to
                            measure in weeks rather than in days. It seems to me that at present we
                            should concentrate on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            himself to make him see that everything he has been working for for the
                            past ten years is threatened with collapse and failure and that bold and
                            far-sighted action on his part is urgently required in order to unite
                            the country and get it back on a favorable course. This may require
                            persistent talks with him in the days ahead in which we would insist
                            that he listen for a change and break through the flood of words which
                            he uses to avoid coming to grips with his real problems. The question of
                            what type of pressures and when such pressures should be applied is the
                            essence of the judgement which you will have to make on the spot. I am
                            inclined to think that in the next immediate stage we should not
                            threaten what we will not or cannot deliver and that we are not yet
                            ready to cut off assistance which affects the war effort or which would
                            inflict serious damage to the people as contrasted with the regime. You
                            have unlimited information to make clear to him that real statesmanship
                            from him is now required to reverse the collapse of his position at
                            home, internationally and in the United States. Our next approach to him
                                <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0224"/>might well be, therefore,
                            to review with him the record of his tenure of the Presidency, including
                            the admittedly positive and courageous contributions he has made and
                            appeal to his pride and patriotism to move toward success and not
                            failure. This could introduce frank and firm discussion of what needs to
                            be done including the baleful effect which the Nhus have been having on
                            his country. Incidentally, we shall be sending you a separate message on
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>'s visit to the
                            United States,<note n="2" xml:id="d98fn2">Apparent reference to telegram
                                405 to Saigon, September 13, in which the Department informed

                                is that official approach to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> on <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame
                                    Nhu</persName>'s possible activities in US not desirable at this
                                time. Would appreciate your ideas on how <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>'s trip to US could be discouraged in a
                                manner not attributable to official US action, for example, do you
                                think there is any possibility that Asta could accomplish it?”
                                (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 1 S VIET-US)</note> a visit which could well be
                            disastrous for Viet-Nam and not merely an irritant for the US
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>6. In sum, and reviewing some of our successes and failures in the past
                            in dealing with similar difficult personalities, it seems to me that our
                            real problem now is to come to grips with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and be prepared to exchange our full confidence and
                            support for the actions which he must take, however difficult, if there
                            is to be a chance for success. I mention confidence because, despite the
                            fact that his position both originally and now has been made possible by
                            persistent and costly American support, he has on several occasions over
                            the past several years undoubtedly gotten the impression that we were
                            trying to unhorse him. It may be that it will be impossible to succeed
                            along this line but the alternatives are so far-reaching that the
                            present effort seems to me to be worth the tedious and frustrating hours
                            which will undoubtedly be required to get through to him and get him to
                            carry out his own full responsibility.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. The Group initially read a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                                summary<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2">Not found.</note> of all the
                            messages which had come in over the past two days. The summary was
                            considered to be so valuable that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> was asked if he could bring it up to date daily,
                            and include within it a list of indicators of major change. Examples
                            were how many Buddhists remain imprisoned; students imprisoned; changes
                            in martial law, curfew, etc.</p>
                        <p>2. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> opened the meeting by referring to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' message where
                            he stated that the Communists had deeply infiltrated the Buddhists and
                                students.<note n="3" xml:id="d99fn3">
                                <ref target="#d96">Document 96</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> stated that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had little specific information on the
                            matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> observed that
                            under any circumstance the government would claim that this was the
                            case, while the Communists would certainly seek to invade these
                            movements. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated
                            that we would query General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to determine factual background on the report
                            that there is Communist motivation and control in the Buddhist/student
                            movements.</p>
                        <p>3. With respect to political orientation of the Buddhists, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> stated that in early
                            July one of the bonzes came to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and
                            asked who the U.S. would like to see as President when they overthrew
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked that the
                            Group consider what we really want <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to do, stating that it is important that these
                            points be listed. He mentioned such things as the removal of censorship
                            and relaxation of military law. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> added
                            that actions of over-repression, such as hauling truck-loads of people
                            to jail, should also be eliminated; and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> added that there should be an end to the arrests of
                            people simply because they oppose the government.</p>
                        <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0226"/>
                        <p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked what progress had
                            been made in the study regarding evacuation of dependents. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> replied that the working group
                            was developing a plan, which would be reported upon to him tomorrow and
                            to the Executive Committee on Monday.<note n="4" xml:id="d99fn4">September 16.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. The Group then was given a draft message by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> (attached).<note n="5" xml:id="d99fn5">
                                <ref target="#d98">Document 98</ref>.</note> After reading it there
                            was considerable discussion as to the impact of the cable on Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. It was Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>'s view that it would convey a major
                            change in policy, from one of urgent action to one of restrained
                            sequential steps. He stated that no such step should be taken over a
                            week-end. It was generally agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s draft message did, in fact, exhibit a major
                            change in thinking here in Washington.</p>
                        <p>7. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> observed that there was probably still
                            some divergency in Washington, and in this sense Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s message seemed to try
                            to bridge that gap, which is not desirable.</p>
                        <p>8. It was ultimately agreed that the message would be restudied and, in
                            the meantime, that a brief message be sent to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> tomorrow stating that his
                            proposals are still under study and that, in the interim, he should go
                            back to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to speak about the
                            matter of <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>, the Senator
                            Church resolution, and the attitude of the U.S. Congress.<note n="6" xml:id="d99fn6">Presumably a reference to telegram 391, <ref target="#d97">Document 97</ref>, which was already sent before
                                this meeting began.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>9. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> stated that there
                            are many more things that should be considered, such as sending a
                            personal emissary to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>;
                            arranging for a meeting between Cardinal Spellman and Archbishop Thuc;
                            sending a personal emissary to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to persuade him to leave the country; seeking to get
                            the Foreign Minister to return; and seeking to get Diem to appoint a
                            military man as Assistant Minister of Defense.<note n="7" xml:id="d99fn7">Regarding the origin of these points, see <ref target="#d100">Document 100</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> obtained the concurrence of the Group
                            that there is no urgency for sending a major policy message to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> for the next
                            two or three days.</p>
                        <p>11. The Group then read a draft letter from the President to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.<note n="8" xml:id="d99fn8">
                                <ref target="#d115">Document 115</ref>.</note> It was generally
                            agreed that such a letter should be forwarded, although this one
                            required some careful study.</p>
                        <p>12. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> observed that
                            transmittal of such a letter should be preceded by agreement here as to
                            our objectives. In discussing objectives, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> stated that it had always been
                            his view that we should work on Diem to improve the government, while
                            still seeking to remove <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> stated that this is unrealistic; <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0227"/>that the general judgment is
                            that splitting the brothers will not work. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> observed that the Defense
                            Department viewpoint is not one of personalities, but one of objectives
                            and actions, and again asked if we could not list the elements of an
                            action program. It was then agreed that a check-list of objectives would
                            be developed by the State Department tomorrow. This would be followed by
                            a comprehensive check-list of the pressures to be used to achieve these
                            objectives, to be completed by Monday. With respect to the second list,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> requested, and it
                            was agreed, that the matter of aid pressures would be kept separate from
                            the remainder.</p>

                        <head>100. Editorial Note</head>
                        <p>At the meeting of September 12, 1963, <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> mentioned several additional courses of action;
                            see numbered paragraph 9 of <ref target="#d99">Document 99</ref>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s points were taken
                            directly from an unattributed <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> paper
                            entitled “A Program for Vietnam,” dated September 4. They comprise
                            paragraphs a-e of what is described in the paper as a program which
                            would “be a reasonably feasible outcome of current problems of Vietnam,
                            although flexibility should be maintained on specific components.” The
                            additional points of the program, which <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> did not mention, read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“f. Continue and strengthen Vice President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>'s committee to negotiate a settlement of the
                            Buddhist problem, emphasizing dealings with the local and provincial
                            level clergy, pagodas, etc., on a religious, nonpolitical, basis.</p>
                        <p>“g. Terminate martial law, reactivate the civilian ministries, and hold
                            the National Assembly elections as soon as reasonably possible. It would
                            not be worth an effort to open the lists to new candidacies as it would
                            be doubtful that any substantial opposition would present itself in any
                            case.</p>
                        <p>“h. Reshuffle the government in certain minor respects such as replacing
                                <persName corresp="#p_NTH1">Ngo Trong Hieu</persName> as Minister of
                            Civic Action.</p>
                        <p>“i. Endeavor to replace <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s
                            advisory role vis-a-vis <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            with a Vietnamese in whom he would have confidence. This might be a
                            combination of two or three in a 'Kitchen Cabinet' to include such
                            figures as Tran Quoc Buu, Trong Vinh Le (extremely weak but probably
                            reassuring to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>), Tran Ngoc
                            Lien.</p>
                        <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0228"/>
                        <p>“j. Clarify the Vietnam Special Forces High Command (<persName corresp="#p_LQTC1">Colonel Tung</persName>) subordination to the
                            Joint General Staff. The formal structure now provides for this but we
                            could make particular efforts to ensure a Joint General Staff feeling of
                            full knowledge and at least veto of <gloss target="#t_VNSFHC1">VNSFHC</gloss> activities.</p>
                        <p>“The above suggestions would be supplementary to and conceived as
                            simultaneous with a program of graduated pressures on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> which carefully signal to him the
                            likelihood of more compelling U.S. actions, forced upon us by pressures
                            of U.S. public and international opinion. They would indicate a sincere
                            search for a way out which would continue the war and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s leadership thereof.” (Kennedy

                        <p>1. Do not see advantage of frequent conversations with Diem if I have
                            nothing new to bring up. Believe mere repetition of points already made
                            would look weak. Visiting <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            is an extremely time-consuming procedure, and it seems to me there are
                            many better ways in which I can use my waking hours. One is by going
                            ahead with my diplomatic calls on the members of the Cabinet who are
                            numerous and who give me interesting information and, of course, another
                            is to spend some time thinking. Not enough hours in the day to do
                            everything I want to do.</p>
                        <p>2. Do not believe either your paragraph 4 a or b will bring removal of
                            the Nhus unless they are geared to a Vietnamese coup d'etat which is
                            well organized around one man. I would certainly not do a or b as
                            isolated measures.</p>
                        <p>3. Hope some study will be given to what our response should be if Nhu,
                            in the course of a negotiation with North Vietnam, should ask the US to
                            leave South Vietnam or to make a major reduction in forces. This is
                            obviously the only trump card he has got and it is obviously of the
                            highest importance. It is also obvious to me that we must not leave. But
                            the question of finding a proper basis for remaining is at first blush
                            not simple.</p>

                            increasingly concerned over the report of the possibility of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> making a deal up north. He said he
                            is going out to the station to say concentrate attention immediately on
                            that problem. He wondered if State might want to do the same thing with
                            Cabot. Governor said yes, he thinks it is a good idea.<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">In telegram 406 to Saigon, September 13, 7:48 p.m.,

                                the better and “stressed the dangerous tendency in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to overdo political activities and

                                US. For this, he said, North Vietnam would pay almost any price.
                                What, he asked, would we do if the Govt of Vietnam invited us to

                        <p>Dear Dean: I ask that you show this letter to the President personally,
                            as it is vital that it not get into the governmental paper mill. For
                            maximum security I am typing it myself<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">The
                                source text was inexpertly typed.</note> and am sending it to you by
                            messenger.</p>
                        <p>What I ask is that General <persName corresp="#p_LMGEG1">Lansdale</persName> be sent over here at once to take charge, under
                            my supervision, of all U.S. relationships with a change of government
                            here. To function efficiently he must have a staff and I therefore ask
                            that he be put in charge of the <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            station in the Embassy, relieving the present incumbent, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJH1">John Richardson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>This is said without casting any reflection on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJH1">Richardson</persName>. Indeed I think of him as a
                            devoted, intelligent and patriotic American. If his loyal support in the
                            past of the U.S. policy of winning the war with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has made it difficult for him to
                            carry out a different policy now, he has never said so or showed it. If,
                            as I am inclined to think, Vietnamese have naturally suspected him of
                            being pro-Diem, it has not been his fault.</p>
                        <p>My request to put General <persName corresp="#p_LMGEG1">Lansdale</persName> in his place is not because I have anything but
                            praise of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJH1">Richardson</persName>, but
                            because of my belief that we need a new face and that General Lansdale
                            has outstanding qualifications.</p>
                        <p>But I hope <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John McCone</persName> will be
                            told my [of] my high regard for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJH1">Richardson</persName>.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary of Cable from Sheldon:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName>, Director of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, concurs with Sheldon's recently
                            expressed views as do most of the military. <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Rufus Phillips</persName> dissents and <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName>'s staff dissents.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName> feels we must stop, look
                            and listen before exercising sanctions by cutting off aid as such action
                            would adversely affect South Viet Nam's closely balanced economy.</p>
                        <p>3. General <persName corresp="#p_TMGC1">Timmes</persName>, Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, expressed firm opinion from <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> division level down that there is no
                            discernible lessening of troop discipline, morale or will to prosecute
                            the war effort. The senior officers have been paying attention recently
                            to political rather than military matters.</p>
                        <p>4. Ambassador and Trueheart convinced war cannot be won with regime,
                            timing [<hi rend="italic">time</hi>] running out, cutting off aid would
                            provoke unpredictable and uncontrollable situation; Ambassador
                            considering initiating coup through General Don with <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>. The Ambassador has the authority to
                            undertake this. Ambassador feels that if such a plan were frustrated by
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and therefore failed, U.S. would be
                            faced with invitation out of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0233"/>
                        <p>5. The original abortive attempt to stimulate a coup was based on hope
                            rather than reality with the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            generals. This attempt revealed to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, leaving U.S. in a weak position. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has further consolidated his
                            position but lacks organization and direct command on part of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> generals, except for General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> who supports Nhu and whose
                            Headquarters are penetrated by <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s agents.</p>
                        <p>6. In summary the U.S. now lacks a means to stage another coup attempt
                            under circumstances of control which will guarantee success.</p>
                        <p>7. Proponents of complete cessation of aid feel this would provide
                            necessary and sufficient catalyst for early overthrow of government but
                            belief is that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has built into
                            the military establishment effective checks and balances to impede
                            generals from taking action.</p>
                        <p>8. Lack of realistic opportunity for coup narrows chances to exert
                            pressure for reforms on regime. Selective aid cuts considered extremely
                            complex and must be approached carefully because of effect on economy,
                            currency, etc. Reduction in military aid would directly affect SVN's
                            ability to pursue struggle against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.
                            Cut in <persName corresp="#p_LQTC1">Colonel Tung</persName>'s Special
                            Forces would probably have no effect on portion of his operation which
                            is active in the political arena. Certain aid frills could be cut but
                            they would have little immediate effect on the regime and would merely
                            be a nuisance.</p>
                        <p>9. We must note we have been conspicuously unsuccessful in long series of
                            attempts to get <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to
                            liberalize his regime. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in
                            the past has been immovable, extremely stubborn and absolutely closed to
                            outside influences and considers concessions a sign of weakness. There
                            is little hope that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will
                            agree to the withdrawal of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            from the scene as he considers <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> indispensable as driving force behind strategic
                            hamlet program and as political manipulator.</p>
                        <p>10. Following a business-as-usual course in the interest of biding our
                            time until successful alternative appears. We run the risk of having the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime solidify its
                            position and thereby further limit our courses of action.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Agree another demarche by me to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to prevent Mme. Nhu from talking would be a
                            mistake. I have already told both <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> that
                            she should stop talking. I made quite a point of it. My guess is that
                            they have on occasion tried to restrain her without accomplishing much,
                            although she was relatively quiet during my first three weeks in
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> answered me last Monday
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NDNM1">Mme. Nhu</persName> was going to hold
                            press conferences in New York as a matter of justice to herself and he
                            evidently approved of her doing so. I told him it would have a bad
                            effect on US opinion. While I believe they have urged her to keep still,
                            there is no doubt that they both approve the general tenor of her
                            speeches. This is one of the things that is fundamentally wrong with the
                            family; they prefer to spend their time striking back at old insults,
                            which result in more bad publicity, instead of going ahead with the war,
                            thereby bringing constructive events to pass which would give them a
                            good press. They seem to take no interest in what other people may
                            think, but are simply interested in expressing their own feelings and
                            their own pride. They are really non-politicians.</p>
                        <p>3. Do not believe [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] would succeed, as he has already pushed Mme. Nhu
                            to the limit to behave herself—once on the telephone in my presence and
                            on two other occasions in personal visits.</p>
                        <p>4. We are using your wire giving the text of the Church resolution<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">See <ref target="#d84fn3">footnote 3,

                            foolish speech by Mme. Nhu could put more signatures onto the
                            resolution.</p>

                        <p>Dear Cabot: Thanks for your note of the 28th<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">Not found.</note> in regard to the prompt action taken on one of
                            your messages which is difficult always to do.</p>
                        <p>All hands here have great admiration for the courageous and incisive
                            manner in which you have moved so rapidly in your new responsibilities. </p>
                        <p>What makes for some confusion, and therefore some delay in answers to
                            your messages, is the matter of some differences that exist between
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' estimates and
                            conclusions and your own. I assume you see all his messages. It might be
                            helpful where you find yourself in disagreement if you would comment on
                            the differences and explain why. Perhaps there is not as much difference
                            as appears from this end, and therefore an explanation of the
                            differences which do exist and the reasons for them would be
                            helpful.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, it was of course clearly understood here that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName>'s reports were based
                            on his contacts with the military, whereas <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName>'s were based on the civilian.</p>
                        <p>I suggest you keep this letter personal between us and not refer to it in
                            telegrams. These get wide distribution. I hope you will feel free to
                            call upon me at any time you feel that I can personally be of assistance
                            to you.</p>
                        <p>I can assure you that from the President on down everybody is determined
                            to support you and the country team in winning the war against the Viet
                            Cong. There may be some differences in opinion or in emphasis as to how
                            it is to be done, but there are no quitters here.</p>
                        <p>The photographs in the press of your short-sleeved walk through the
                            market place got you a lot of votes here, and I am sure make a new
                            impression of an American Ambassador and his wife in Saigon.</p>

                        <p>Some sympathy for the U.S. dilemma in Viet-Nam has emerged in the last
                            week, particularly in Western Europe, but most comment is still critical
                            of U.S. policies. There is virtually no sympathy for the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime, except in South Korea and
                            the Philippines where officials see Diem as the only available
                            anti-communist bulwark. This applies to some extent to Thailand as
                            well.</p>

                        <p>The situation in Viet-Nam continues to receive major news play but
                            editorial comment has slackened during past week. Available comment,
                            both media and official, has tended to focus on the question of
                            continued U.S. support for the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime. Reference to the possibility of a
                            neutralized Viet-Nam, as implied by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>, has been limited. Buddhist groups in Thailand,
                            Burma and Cambodia continue to agitate against <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> treatment of Buddhists. Peking and Hanoi reports now
                            reflect belief that U.S. may eventually replace <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> but that this will not affect the
                            war.</p>

                        <p>Viet-Nam crisis remains the subject of continuing and extensive news
                            coverage and considerable editorial comment in the West European press.
                            Comment has been almost totally critical of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> family regime. Though not
                            uncritical of some American moves, the majority of non-Communist papers
                            display considerable sympathy for the U.S. dilemma, and have offered few
                            concrete suggestions for remedies. Recent news coverage has played up
                            U.S. alleged participation in anti-Diem moves but editorial comment on
                            this subject is not yet available.</p>

                        <p>Crisis continues receive substantial news play though volume has dwindled
                            somewhat since the wave of reaction following the imposition of martial
                            law and attack on pagodas on August 21. Scattered editorials and
                            backgrounders in media are relentlessly critical of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime and continue to view its
                            removal as the only answer if the war against the Viet Cong is to be
                            won. Criticism of U.S. policy has softened somewhat, most editorial
                            comment viewing U.S. as faced with necessity of dealing with “difficult
                            and corrupt” regime with which it has little sympathy while responding
                            to the longer range necessity of fighting the Viet Cong. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> proposal for unification has
                            drawn little attention. Three leading Indian newspapers split sharply,
                            one opposing and two supporting it.</p>

                            Vietnam's independence. He has repeatedly lied to our Ambassador and the

                        <p>This has impaired our position in South Vietnam. Colonel Lac, responsible
                            for implementing the strategic hamlet program, claims that progress has
                            slowed in the last three months because of the anti-American attitude of
                            “certain elements” in Saigon. At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s boast that he commands the basic
                            support of the United States both inhibits his opponents and expands his
                            prestige by humiliating high officials.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has claimed privately that
                            should United States aid be cut he would seek help elsewhere. Should
                            that fail, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> asserts he would
                            negotiate a settlement with Hanoi. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has convinced both Vietnamese and foreign observers
                            that such a prospect is likely. Reports that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is already in contact with Hanoi are so credible and
                            widespread as eventually to undermine morale in the army and
                            bureaucracy, regardless of their current accuracy.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is capable of believing he
                            could manipulate the situation to his advantage, whether through
                            fighting or negotiating with the communists. His megalomania is manifest
                            in his claim that only he can save Vietnam. Both <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Nguyen Dinh Thuan</persName> and Vo Van Hai
                            testify to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s opium smoking
                            during the past two years, providing at least partial explanation for
                            his excess of self-confidence and fantasies of power.</p>

                        <p>According to General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>,
                            both sentiment and reality in South Vietnam have polarized strongly and

                            and flourish” with them gone and Diem still President. We concur fully
                            in General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' view of the
                            Nhus.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> reports that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s departure would be
                            hailed by military officers. He was told by the Vietnamese Airborne
                            Brigade Commander of strong dissatisfaction with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. Colonel Lac indicated that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would not last 24 hours
                            if the United States made clear it would not tolerate this situation.
                            Tran Quoc Buu, head of the largest labor organization in Vietnam, claims
                            that his followers believe that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> must go. He fears that should <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> emerge victorious from the present
                            crisis, worse blunders will ensue, permitting an eventual Communist
                            takeover. Vo Van Hai believes that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> cannot regain the confidence of his people so long
                            as <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> remains.</p>
                        <p>We agree with the Country Team assessment that (1) <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is disliked, hated, feared, or

                        </p>
                        <p>1. In connection with the studies now being made of how to put pressure
                            on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, I hope the fact will be
                            borne in mind that not once since I have been here have I been asked for
                            anything by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. When you consider
                            that the US is spending $1-1/2 million a day in this country, and that I
                            am the personal representative of the President, it does seem that they
                            ought to be in some doubt at least about a few major items and that they
                            ought to want to curry a a little favor with me in order to get these
                            items. The explanation for this curious state of affairs is that they
                            are absolutely sure of our aid and know that it comes along
                            automatically no matter what they do and that I am really not
                            needed.</p>
                        <p>2. I do not believe that any amount of financial pressure will compel
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to leave the country even
                            for so short a time as between now and Christmas. Nor do I think we can
                            use our aid in order to strike a bargain that will cause <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> to stop talking. But it seems
                            to me a healthy thing for people to feel that they must see the personal
                            representative of the President of the US to get some of the largesse
                            which they hope to get out of the US Government. If they got into the
                            habit of coming to me with requests for favors, it ought to be possible,
                            in the not too distant future, to get them to do at least a few of the
                            things we want them to do.</p>

                        <p>3. We know that ordinary methods of conversational persuasion have no
                            effect whatever and that even if one makes an impression on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> at the time, he is immediately
                            brainwashed by his brother later. Presenting him with some unfavorable
                            facts which he can only change by performing an act of some kind is
                            therefore certainly worth trying.</p>

                            judging from the reports, it seemed as if things should be quiet there
                            for the next day or so. Forrestal reported that martial law and
                            censorship had been lifted, and that free elections were scheduled. He
                            added that the practical effects of this were not known.</p>

                            <persName>Bundy</persName> then commented on how the <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName> article in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> yesterday (attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">Not attached.

                            agencies. He reminded Forrestal that he (Forrestal) had warned that this
                            was coming, but that everyone realized that there was nothing that could
                            be done. <persName>Bundy</persName> then asked whether it would be
                            useful to have <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> come up
                            with an analysis of the errors in the article, particularly those parts
                            dealing with the conduct of the war. <persName>Bundy</persName> added
                            that the reports on the fighting, e.g., number of incidents and wounded,
                            were about the most useful type of evidence he had seen.</p>
                        <p>Forrestal tried to discourage <persName>Bundy</persName> from this,

                            it turned out that <persName>Bundy</persName> had seen the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> piece, whose main import seemed to be
                            that the war in the Delta was not going as well as the war elsewhere and
                            that there were two different kinds of wars.</p>

                        <p>About this point in the discussion, <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName> of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, in an

                            talks, the time of the year he talks, etc. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            summed up by saying that <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName>
                            evidently agreed with him that the situation was very difficult to

                        <p>Toward the end of the discussion, <persName>Bundy</persName> said that

                            sympathetic to the military viewpoint than I thought. Forrestal tried to
                            be non-committal, but his past actions, as well as those at the table
                            today, put him still squarely on the side of getting rid of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. The most surprising thing was
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName>'s attitude. To me it
                            indicated more of a split between the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> than I,
                            following the evidence at a distance, had been aware of.</p>

                        <p>1. The meeting was preceded by distribution of an up-to-date intelligence
                            roundup by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d113fn2">Not found.</note>

                        <p>2. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> opened the
                            meeting by asking if we had any details of what military units had moved
                            out of the capital and what the real significance was. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> replied that we had no
                            definitive information but that we would send an inquiry to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then asked if there had
                            been any thought given to discussing with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> the prospect of getting Tri Quang out of the country
                            rather than releasing him to be a continuing annoyance in Vietnam. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that, to his
                            knowledge, nothing of this sort had been contemplated but that he would
                            suggest it to the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then asked if there was
                            any basis for real apprehension that students might be going over to the
                            Viet Cong. To this Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                            suggested that the Group might wish to question Mr. Sheldon (from <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Headquarters) and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Smith</persName> (from the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Station in Saigon) who had just returned from Saigon
                            this morning. These two individuals were then brought in and the Group
                            questioned them as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">From Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                            </hi>. Do you believe that the dissident students are going over to the
                            Viet Cong?</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Reply</hi>. Three schools in Saigon have probably been
                            infiltrated by the Viet Cong. This is something that has been known for
                            some time. The general impression is that some Saigon students have
                            defected to the Viet Cong; the number is not large-not exceeding 30.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Reply</hi>. Less than 200 students remain in
                            custody-100 of these are in jail, 100 in the armed services. The arrest
                            of students was widespread and extended to almost anyone involved with
                            the Lycee or the university. Release, in most cases, was prompt</p>

                            all the time. It is mostly talk because the key is the loyalty of the
                            military units, and there is little assurance in this area. Some of the
                            coup talkers speak of having acquired loyalty from junior officers and
                            some units in the Saigon area, but there are no specifics.</p>

                            no hope of maintaining his influence in any other way he will go to
                            Moscow—probably via Yugoslavia—to propose that the Soviets and French
                            take over our commitments. The compensation would be in terms of U.S.
                            withdrawal and the possibility of a Soviet presence. To this Governor

                            brief distribution of two <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0246"/>general lines of action, one involving conciliation; one involving
                            pressures. He was emphatic in his statement that we should be prepared
                            to reverse our course at any time in the event that we achieved some
                            degree of success. The papers were not discussed in detail.</p>
                        <p>6. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that a
                            cable of instructions would have to be drafted quickly for the
                            Ambassador in order for him to get an accurate view of Washington level
                            reactions.</p>
                        <p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> proposed that the
                            paper embodying a conciliatory program be taken as a basis;<note n="6" xml:id="d113fn6">Copies of the paper, “Reconciliation With a

                            at large, as seen here, be developed; that it be followed by the
                            elements of the conciliatory approach; that we include the Presidential
                            letter; that we realize that a conciliatory approach may not succeed, in
                            which case further steps may have to be taken; and finally that the
                            Ambassador's views on all the above be solicited.</p>
                        <p>8. The general meeting was then terminated, followed by a brief session
                            including the Secretaries of State and Defense, the Chairman of the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> described the session
                            as the occasion for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to
                            say that he preferred the conciliatory rather than the pressure
                            approach, and that a cable embodying these thoughts would be drafted for
                            consideration by the President.</p>
                        <p>9. Subsequently, I discussed events with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>, who advised me that he had been directed by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to prepare two

                        <p>Attached are two cables—one on the “Reconciliation Track” and one on the
                            “Pressures and Persuasion Track.”</p>
                        <p>I think it is important to note that these are true alternatives—i.e.,
                            the “Reconciliation Track” is not the same as Phase I of the “Pressures
                            and Persuasion Track.” The difference is in public posture. Phase I of
                            the “Pressures and Persuasion Track” continues to maintain a public
                            posture of disapproval of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s
                            policies of repression. The “Reconciliation Track” requires a public
                            posture of acquiescence in what the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            has recently done, and even some effort by the US to put these recent
                            actions in as good a light as we possibly can.</p>
                        <p>If this distinction, which is a real one, is preserved, then it seems to
                            me clear that it will not be possible to switch from the “Reconciliation
                            Track” to a “Pressures and Persuasion Track” if the former does not
                            work—except in the event that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            provide us with another dramatic act of repression as an excuse. On the
                            other hand, it will be possible to switch from a “Pressures and
                            Persuasion Track” to a “Reconciliation Track” at any time during Phases
                            I and II of the “Pressures and Persuasion Track,” although probably not
                            after we had entered Phases III and IV.</p>
                        <p>My own judgment is that the “Reconciliation Track” will not work. I think
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has already decided on
                            an adventure. I think he feels that the progress already made in the war
                            and the US materiel on hand gives him freedom to launch on a course that
                            has a minimum and a maximum goal. The minimum goal would be sharply to
                            reduce the American presence in those key positions which have political
                            significance in the provinces and the strategic hamlet program and to
                            avoid any meaningful concessions that would go against his Mandarin,
                            “personalist” vision of the future of Viet-Nam. The maximum goal I would
                            think, would be a deal with North Viet-Nam for a truce in the war, a
                            complete removal of the US presence, and a “neutralist” or “Titoist” but
                            still separate South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0248"/>
                        <p>At the same time, I would give Phases I and II of the “Pressures and
                            Persuasion Track” only a fair chance of success, and I think that Phases
                            III and IV will create a situation over which we would have little if
                            any control, at least if they were launched in the immediate future.</p>
                        <p>Thus, I would recommend adopting as our initial course Phases I and II of
                            the “Pressures and Persuasion Track” testing and probing as we go along
                            and being ready to switch to “Reconciliation” at any moment that it
                            becomes necessary, using the decision to switch as a means of getting at
                            least nominal concessions in order to save as much of our face as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>I make this recommendation with the caveat that we do not have sufficient
                            information to make a final and complete judgment on either of the two
                            key issues—where <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> will lead
                            Viet-Nam if he remains in power and whether or not enough people will
                            continue to fight the Viet Cong to bring victory.</p>
                        <p>The trouble is the necessary information for a final judgment on these
                            two key issues is simply not available. Nor is anyone likely to acquire
                            it before we make a fundamental decision. This is not an unfamiliar
                            dilemma in the making of foreign policy. At such a time governments
                            perforce operate on informed hunch, hoping only that the hunch they use
                            is the best one available.</p>
                        <p>But I also think that at such a time governments must not even attempt to
                            make final judgments or to take irreversible actions, but to proceed by
                            incremental steps. It is for this reason that I would reject both
                            “Reconciliation” and Phases III and IV—at least at this time.</p>

                            once.</p>
                        <p>Our analysis of the situation is as follows: <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> are
                            well entrenched and will resist changes stubbornly. Ultimate sanction of
                            cutting aid thus runs risk of forcing them into a corner where their
                            choices will be between capitulation and departure of whole family, and
                            showdown and either Gotterdammerung or a deal with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, with latter more likely.</p>
                        <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0249"/>
                        <p>We are therefore faced with problem not only of reconciliation with
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> but of obtaining sufficient
                            popular support for the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            government to enable it to win the war. The central problem will still
                            be <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>—his position as political
                            symbol to the disaffected, his philosophy and concept of the State, his
                            conviction that Americans in positions we deem essential are an obstacle
                            to achieving his goal, and his possible machinations with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Within Viet-Nam the major target of rehabilitation effort must be the
                            urban elite. Ensuring their support will require credible reforms, which
                            will in turn help to improve the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            image abroad.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Approach</p>
                        <p>You should institute dialogue with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> against background of current internal US and
                            external world pressure for reform in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Basis of conversation is Presidential letter forwarded
                            via immediately following cable. Tone should be persuasion combined with
                            sympathy and understanding. Major inducement will be U.S. official
                            statements designed to restore <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> image at
                            home and abroad (see Public Posture below). Probably wise to have
                            someone like Lansdale assist you through long-standing personal
                            friendship with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>You should say that the programs thus far followed to win the war have
                            been sound and generally successful but have lagged in that they did not
                            take sufficient account of the aspirations of the leading elements
                            primarily in the main urban centers but also in cities at the provincial
                            and district levels. Their support vital to arrest present
                            deterioration.</p>
                        <p>Political opposition as expressed in the Buddhist movement was not caused
                            by Communist subversion but by the absence of a feeling of stake and
                            participation in the Government and its programs on the part of these
                            leading elements.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Program</p>
                        <p>Following are major topics you should plan to cover with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>: a) <hi rend="italic">Family</hi>—<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> should
                            think deeply and sincerely about the role of members of his family, not
                            only <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> but also <persName corresp="#p_THUC1">Thuc</persName> and Can. He should consider
                            making their role more open and less susceptible to charges they are
                            conspiratorial and therefore nefarious in their activities.</p>
                        <p>b) <hi rend="italic">Party</hi>—Can Lao party should not be covert or
                            semi-covert but a broad association of supporters engaged in a common,
                            winning cause. This could perhaps be best accomplished by disbanding the
                            party and starting afresh.</p>
                        <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0250"/>
                        <p>c) <hi rend="italic">Elections</hi>—These should be held, should be free,
                            and should be widely observed. Candidate lists should be reopened and
                            members of the opposition should be allowed full and free participation.
                            They should and can be defeated in a free battle.</p>
                        <p>d) <hi rend="italic">Assembly</hi>—Assembly should be convoked, if
                            necessary in extraordinary session. The Government should submit its
                            policies to it and should receive its confidence. An Assembly resolution
                            would be most useful for external image purposes.</p>
                        <p>e) <hi rend="italic">Normalcy</hi>—<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> should get everyone back to work and get them to
                            focus on winning the war. He should be broadminded and compassionate in
                            his attitude toward those who have, for understandable reasons, found it
                            difficult under recent circumstances fully to support him.</p>
                        <p>A real spirit of reconciliation could work wonders on the people he
                            heads; a punitive, harsh or autocratic attitude could only lead to
                            further resistance.</p>
                        <p>f) <hi rend="italic">Press</hi>—The press should be allowed full latitude
                            of expression. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will be
                            criticized, but leniency and cooperation with the domestic and foreign
                            press at this time would bring praise for his leadership in due
                            course.</p>
                        <p>g) <hi rend="italic">Buddhists and Students</hi>—Let them out and leave
                            them unmolested. This more than anything else would demonstrate the
                            return of a better day and the refocussing on the main job at hand, the
                            war.</p>
                        <p>h) <hi rend="italic">Secret and Combat</hi> Police—Keep its role to a
                            minimum and as circumspect as possible, thereby indicating clearly that
                            a period of reconciliation and political stability has returned.</p>
                        <p>Following are additional specific remedial actions you should bring up
                            with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> as appropriate:</p>
                        <p>a. A repeal or suitable amendment Decree 10.</p>
                        <p>b. Rehabilitation by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> of

                            agitation, naming those who subverted it into political vehicle to
                            overthrow <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>d. Establishment of Ministry of Religious Affairs.</p>
                        <p>e. Liberation of passport issuances and currency restrictions enabling
                            all to leave who wish to.</p>
                        <p>f. Offer of 1000 student scholarships in US permitting departure of
                            inimical elements.</p>
                        <p>g. Cabinet changes to inject new untainted blood, remove targets of
                            popular discontent.</p>
                        <p>h. Acceptance of Buddhist Inquiry Mission from World Federation to report
                            true facts of situation to world.</p>

                        <p>a. Work in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to blunt the debate in

                        <p>b. Prepare White Paper placing recent events in perspective, noting
                            essential political character of Buddhist agitation, that only small
                            numbers of pagodas occupied by force and violence, and that Buddhist
                            religion never really seriously interfered with as far as majority
                            Vietnamese concerned.</p>
                        <p>c. Present this privately before publication to key members of

                                <ref target="#d86">Document 86</ref>.</note> Action Plan for
                            Viet-Nam is outlined below. Phases 1 and 2 approved at highest level,
                            and you should proceed to progressive implementation. Washington
                            decision will not be taken on further phases which add increasing
                            pressures, until we see results of actions under Phases 1 and 2.</p>
                        <p>Part I, <hi rend="italic">Objective and Concept</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Objective. Our overall objective in South Viet-Nam is to win war against
                            Viet Cong. Recent repressive actions of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> have created disaffection which will inevitably affect
                            war effort unless <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> undertakes changes
                            in both policies and personnel that are effective and credible.</p>
                        <p>While withdrawal by US would be immediately disastrous to war effort,
                            acquiescence by US in recent <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> actions
                            would be equally disastrous, although less immediately so. We therefore
                            propose follow policy of persuasion coupled with pressure on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> aimed at inducing it to take actions
                            which will insure sufficient popular support to win war against Viet
                            Cong. This policy should be implemented in such a way as to avoid
                            triggering either civil violence or radical move by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to make deal with DRV and remove US
                            presence.</p>
                        <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0252"/>
                        <p>Actions by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Check list of desired
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> actions to ensure popular
                            support necessary to win war are divided into two categories: (A)
                            actions designed to reverse recent policies of repression, and (B)
                            actions essential to set psychological tone and image which will make
                            category A actions effective and credible.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Category A Actions:</p>
                        <p>1. Release and freedom from pursuit of all those recently arrested,
                            except only those who have indubitably engaged in subversive action.</p>
                        <p>2. Announcement that Vice President Tho is designated to negotiate with a
                            legitimate reconstituted Intersect Committee of Buddhists, these
                            negotiations to lead to joint statement of reconciliation.</p>
                        <p>3. Effective revocation of martial law.</p>
                        <p>4. Removal of all censorship.</p>
                        <p>5. Scheduling of a definite date for holding of new National Assembly
                            elections; reopening of list of candidates and guarantee that elections
                            will be free. </p>
                        <p>6. Convocation of extraordinary session of National Assembly to announce
                            actions above. </p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Category B Actions:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s government should be
                            reorganized and broadened to include respected individuals such as Tran
                            Quoc Buu and Pham Huy Quat, with one or two posts given to senior
                            generals such as <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> and with a recall to
                            public service of one or two individuals who have left Vietnam, such as
                            Vu Van Maul</p>
                        <p>2. Since <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> symbolize to world and to
                            important Vietnamese opinion <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            policies of repression, Nhus' power must be terminated in order to lend
                            credibility to statements of policy changes and assure a fresh start.
                            This requires their departure from Vietnam, at least for extended
                            vacation.</p>
                        <p>Need to set psychological tone and image is paramount. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has taken positive actions in
                            past of greater or less scope than those contemplated in Category A but
                            which have had little practical political effect. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has already taken many of steps
                            in Category A but in such a way as to make them hollow or, even if real,
                            unbelievable (e.g., martial law already nominally lifted, assembly
                            elections scheduled, and puppet bonzes established).</p>
                        <p>Thus specific “reforms” are apt to have little impact without dramatic,
                            symbolic move which convinces Vietnamese that reforms are real. As
                            practical matter this can only be achieved by some visible reduction in
                            influence of Nhus, who are—justifiably or not—symbol to disaffected of
                            all that they detest in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Even though it not our intention remove <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, Ngo family may so resist reversal of policies and
                            removal of Nhus as to make <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s removal inevitable. If so, our goal should be so to
                            structure situation that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            has option of staying without his brother or retiring of his own free
                            will.</p>
                        <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0253"/>
                        <p>We recognize possibility this campaign may also result in resumed coup
                            plotting. We propose to give no encouragement to such activities at this
                            time, although we remain ready to listen to serious approaches.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Part II, Phase 1.</p>
                        <p>1. Phase 1 concentrates on suasion by a continuation of your
                            conversations with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> on
                            problem of US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> relations in all its
                            ramifications. Although past experience does not lead us to be hopeful
                            that suasion alone will accomplish desired results, it seems essential
                            to make attempt if only to establish a record and lay groundwork for
                            Phase 2.</p>
                        <p>2. You should present to President Diem Presidential letter<note n="5" xml:id="d114fn5">

                        <p>3. In presenting Presidential letter it is suggested that you review
                            situation along following lines:</p>
                        <p>Since your last meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            USG has been faced with crisis of confidence in Vietnamese Government on
                            part of American public and more particularly Congress. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is undoubtedly aware of
                            increasing tempo of criticism of his government appearing in all sectors
                            of US press without regard to geographic location. In addition, he is
                            aware of movement in US Congress, exemplified by Church resolution,
                            which if unchecked could result in Congressional action to cut off all
                            aid to Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Another factor must be borne in mind, and that is world opinion. This too
                            has been universally condemnatory of regime and its recent policies of
                            repression. This will inevitably be manifested dramatically in General
                            Assembly when present resolution on Buddhist question is debated. US and
                            other friendly nations who are aiding Vietnam will find it politically
                            difficult support <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> under present circumstances. US cannot
                            control world opinion, but as leader of free world its attitudes carry
                            great deal of influence. If US, major support of South Vietnam, has its
                            confidence in GVN restored, this will have favorable effect on attitudes
                            shown by other nations.</p>
                        <p>In order to preserve aid program to South Vietnam, which President
                            sincerely desires to do, he has written President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> personal letter urging him to
                            take steps necessary to permit USG to meet criticisms of its people and
                            Congress and continue assisting Vietnamese war effort.</p>
                        <p>4. We believe you should also reiterate to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> actions (see checklist above) which US considers
                            desirable for him to take to counter US and world criticisms and enable
                            us to continue cooperate with him.</p>
                        <p>5. In this phase we hereby authorize limited, voluntary evacuation of
                            American dependents. Separate cable being forwarded on implementing

                        <p>In this phase we add selective cuts in aid which will have least effect

                        <p>Tone of your conversations should continue be that US purpose is to

                            President desires to do. Regretfully, however, has become politically

                            which we agree, i.e., fight against Viet Cong. Otherwise, Congress may
                            cut off all aid.</p>
                        <p>We notify Diem of these actions with great reluctance and wish assure him
                            we will attempt continue or redirect aid for programs essential to war
                            effort as this can be worked out. If Diem can take dramatic actions we
                            requesting promptly, we feel we can quickly restore conditions but we
                            may have make further cuts, again in order avoid total cut of aid.</p>

                        <p>In context of above, you should inform <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that in light of unsatisfactory response to your
                            (Phase 1) effort at persuasion, USG has now instructed you review for
                            him actions relating our programs Viet-Nam which have now, or recently,
                            been taken.</p>
                        <p>A. We are not moving ahead with decisions on major <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> actions, such as negotiation of $33
                            million additional new <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 sales

                            allotments, and the approval of certain new contracts.</p>
                        <p>B. We will withhold our support from organs of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> which have been supporting policies of repression, and
                            will specifically withhold additional supplies and equipment from
                            certain operations and elements of the combat police and <gloss target="#t_DGI1">DGI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>

                        <p>C. We will require written guarantees that <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> provided equipment will not be used in acts against
                            non-Communist political or religious groups from any <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> agency likely to be involved in such
                            acts.</p>
                        <p>D. We have given instructions to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJH1">John
                                Richardson</persName> to suspend immediately payments to all

                            not serving those activities may continue to be supported by payments
                            directly to project officers, provided the projects are in our mutual
                            best interest.</p>
                        <p>E. The Executive Branch considers any effort to contest moves in Congress
                            to restrict or terminate U.S. aid programs in Viet-Nam bound to be
                            ineffective under present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>F. The US did not oppose the inscription of an item proposed in the
                            United Nations General Assembly censoring the violation of human rights
                            in Viet-Nam, and will not be in a position, due to the <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0255"/>state of domestic opinion in the US, to
                            oppose its adoption by the General Assembly unless a radical improvement

                        <p>G. Reluctantly the United States has decided that the unsettled
                            conditions in South Viet-Nam require us to evacuate all American
                            dependents.</p>

                            White House must announce general nature of actions taken by USG. You

                            authority to recommend to Washington timing of this announcement.</p>
                        <p>Should we move into this phase (Phase 2), you have discretionary

                            suspension of aid to certain programs is that USG cannot condone actions

                                distinct Phases 3 and 4 of Part III. Phase 3 in the September 16
                                paper has been incorporated into this cable in revised form as Part
                                III, Phase 2. Phase 4 has been dropped. The substantive portion of
                                Phase 4 in Hilsman's draft paper of September 16 reads as follows:
                                    <p>“It appears that if <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has refused to accept US demands in the
                                    face of Phase 3 actions, there is no alternative but to announce
                                    (publicly or privately) complete disassociation with the
                                        <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime. Such an
                                    announcement should reassert US desires to continue support of
                                    the Vietnamese people in their fight for freedom, and to
                                    indicate US willingness to support an alternative regime—either
                                    in Saigon or elsewhere in Viet-Nam. [Here follows a listing of
                                    actions to accompany such an announcement.] If the US correctly
                                    has estimated civil and military readiness to overthrow
                                        <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, an alternate
                                    government should emerge with sufficient popular support to
                                    carry on the fight against the Viet Cong while coping with
                                        <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, if he remains
                                    in the Saigon area. If the US has not correctly assessed the
                                    readiness of the military to desert <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and he, in fact, retains control of most
                                    major forces, the US would face the final decision of US
                                    military intervention or complete withdrawal from Viet-Nam. In
                                    this situation, US military intervention to fight a former ally
                                    could serve no useful purpose, since there would not exist a

                        <p>Dear Mr. President: 1. I am sending you this letter because of the
                            gravity of the situation which now confronts our two countries, in their
                            relations with each other. For us in the United States, difficult and
                            painful decisions cannot long be deferred, and I know that you on your
                            side have problems of similar gravity. Moreover, it is clear to me as I
                            work on this matter that many of its difficulties arise from problems in
                            assessing the real facts of the situation. Both of our Governments, for
                            different reasons, face great difficulties on this score. And so I think
                            it may be important and helpful for you to know accurately just how the
                            situation appears to me. In return, I shall greatly value the most
                            candid expression of your own assessment, and it may well be that you
                            and I between us can work out a new understanding in place of the
                            present troubled, confused and dangerous relationship between our
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>2. At the outset, let me state plainly that the central purpose of my
                            Government in all of its relations with your country is that the
                            Communists should be defeated in their brazen effort to capture your
                            country by force and fraud of all varieties. What we do and do not do,
                            whether it seems right or wrong to our friends, is always animated by
                            this central purpose. In all that it does in its relations with your
                            country, the United States Government gives absolute priority to the
                            defeat of the Communists.</p>
                        <p>3. This purpose, in a general way, has been a part of American policy
                            toward your country for many years, but as you know it took a new shape
                            and clarity at the end of 1961. At that time, in light of the very
                            unsatisfactory situation in Laos, and in view of the increasing efforts
                            then being made by the Viet Cong, I sent two of my most trusted
                            associates on a careful mission of inquiry to your country. The mission
                            of General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> was to give me the
                            best possible judgment of the course of the struggle in South Vietnam
                            and the prospect of success. Their comprehensive report<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">For the report and related documents, see <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d210">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961-1963, vol. I,
                                    Documents 210</ref> ff.</note> convinced me, first, that the
                            situation was indeed very serious, and, second, that by appropriate and
                            determined action your Government and ours together could find a way to
                            victory. Our two Governments then worked out together, and you and I as
                            their leaders formally approved, a new <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0258"/>level of effort and cooperation. And I think it is fair
                            to say that both our Governments have been loyal to that effort, to the
                            limit of their abilities, ever since.</p>
                        <p>4. By the hardest kind of joint effort, in which of course your people
                            have borne the heavier and more immediate responsibility, the contest
                            against the Communists in the last year and a half has gradually but
                            steadily fumed in our favor. New levels of alertness and skill were
                            developed in the forces of your country, and the bold and imaginative
                            program of strategic hamlets was pressed forward with steadily
                            increasing energy and speed. Each of us, I know, pays close attention to
                            our reports from all over the country on the course of the struggle
                            against the Viet Cong, and I am sure that these reports agree on the
                            basic proposition that the war has been going well, at least until very
                            recently. And since newspaper reports and the problem of the press
                            generally are an important element of difficulty in our relations, it is
                            only fair for me to say that I have been as much irritated as I am sure
                            you must have been, by inaccurate press reports, which tend to disparage
                            unfairly the effectiveness of our joint effort against the Viet
                            Cong.</p>
                        <p>5. A great cooperative venture of the kind in which we have been engaged
                            is never easy for the representatives of separate sovereign states. On
                            the one hand, the struggle is Vietnamese at its center, not American.
                            You and your Government have responsibilities, as Vietnamese to Vietnam,
                            which are inevitably different from those which I and my Government have
                            as Americans to America. At the point of immediate battle, when one of
                            our pilots or advisors is in the same danger as your soldiers, these
                            lines of division tend to fade and even disappear, but further back the
                            differences are real and not wholly avoidable. I have read with interest
                            cables from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>
                            in which he has reported your own awareness of this difficulty and your
                            deep concern with it. I want you to know that I too see this problem. In
                            particular, I recognize that it must be a matter of real difficulty for
                            members of your Government to find large numbers of Americans holding
                            positions of considerable responsibility and authority in matters which
                            are of great and immediate importance to the people of Vietnam. I well
                            understand your insistence upon avoiding, in our relations, anything
                            that might instill in your people a colonial spirit of acceptance of
                            foreign domination. In this regard, I want you to know that I have
                            personally assured myself that the top American personnel, in every
                            department and agency concerned, fully understand my determination that
                            Americans in Vietnam shall act in full respect for the independence of
                            your country and for the proper determination of your people to be free
                            of domination even by their friends. At the same time, as you know, we
                            cannot avoid the necessity for extensive participation by our
                            representatives in a situation in which <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0259"/>our own resources, and thousands of members of our
                            armed forces, are so heavily committed. I have been grateful for your
                            ability to understand and respect our necessities, just as I have tried
                            to respect yours.</p>
                        <p>6. In the last four months, by a series of events which neither you nor I
                            can have wished and whose impact is surely a matter of equal regret to
                            us both, a new and grave set of difficulties has been created for us
                            both. It is not my purpose here to recount in detail events with which
                            you yourself are familiar, nor even to repeat expressions of concern,
                            which you have heard many times from Ambassador Nolting and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, on the existing
                            situation and dangers within your country.</p>
                        <p>7. It may well be your view that American opinion has been misled on
                            these recent events, and I recognize that this is always a possibility
                            in a world in which the accurate judgment of distant happenings is very
                            difficult. But that leads me to urge upon you as strongly as I can that
                            the only way to correct this difficulty is to allow more and not less
                            reporting by Americans in your country. If there is one principle upon
                            which my people are united, by Constitutional commitment, conviction,
                            and tradition, it is that the way to get at the truth is to let people
                            see for themselves. At present, acting on feelings which are
                            understandable, and working from a tradition quite different from our
                            own, your Government is engaged in a limitation and censorship of news,
                            and in a harassment of reporters, which can only have—and is having—the
                            most destructive effects upon confidence between our two peoples. I
                            repeat that I well understand the irritation which tendentious reporting
                            can cause, but I cannot overemphasize to you the damage which is done to
                            your own cause and to our common purpose by limitations of this sort. No
                            single step would do more to reopen the path to effective cooperation
                            than an immediate and complete abandonment of all restrictions upon the
                            flow of news to and from our countries.</p>
                        <p>8. I must stress, however, that effective cooperation does not depend
                            solely on a freer flow of truthful information. It is a fact, as I found
                            it necessary to say publicly two weeks ego,<note n="3" xml:id="d115fn3">See <ref target="#d50">Document 50</ref>.</note> that we in our
                            Government are gravely troubled by the danger that some of the methods
                            used by some members of your Government may be creating a situation in
                            which it will not be possible to sustain public support in Vietnam for
                            the struggle against the Communists. You will feel, I am sure, that you
                            have a right to your own judgment on this matter, and it is not likely
                            that in a single message from this distance I can change your mind. What
                            I must do, however, is to make clear the effect of recent events upon
                            the situation here in the United States and upon the possibilities of
                            action open to me.</p>
                        <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0260"/>
                        <p>9. At the present time it is a fact that unless there can be important
                            changes and improvements in the apparent relation between the Government
                            and the people in your country, opinion here, in the public and in the
                            Congress, will make it impossible for me to continue without change the
                            great cooperative programs which we have been pressing for since 1961. I
                            have said publicly that we do not wish to cut off our aid programs at
                            this time, and I shall not change this position except as such change
                            becomes necessary in response to public opinion and the democratic
                            processes of this country. But it would be wrong for me not to let you
                            know that such change is inevitable unless the situation in Vietnam can
                            somehow take a major turn for the better.</p>
                        <p>10. At a minimum, and within a short period of time, it will become
                            necessary for this Government to take actions which make it clear that
                            American cooperation and American assistance will not be given to or
                            through individuals whose acts and words seem to run against the purpose
                            of genuine reconciliation and unified national effort against the
                            Communists. This is so because without such limitations and
                            modifications it will become impossible for us to keep on with our major
                            effort in support of your country. Unless I can show the American people
                            that the United States is wholly dissociated from acts which have raised
                            grave questions here, I clearly can not sustain public support for the
                            central effort.</p>
                        <p>11. There is much more that needs to be talked out between our two
                            countries on these grave matters. I am asking Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, as my personal representative,
                            to express my views to you in frankness and candor and to be at your
                            disposal for further discussion. What Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> says to you has my explicit
                            authorization and approval. Of course I shall also warmly welcome a
                            direct expression of your personal views in a message to me at any time.
                            I do not suppose that when two independent nations reach a grave level
                            of disagreement the fault can ever lie on one side only, and you will
                            not find us rigid or unresponsive in the effort to reestablish and to
                            sustain in the future the cooperation which has, until lately, had such
                            strikingly effective results. I repeat that it remains the central
                            purpose of the United States in its friendly relation with South Vietnam
                            to defeat the aggressive designs of the Communists. But I must also
                            repeat that this purpose can only be achieved if steps are taken to
                            remove the obstacles that have so seriously and regrettably impaired our
                            cooperative effort. </p>

                        <p>I am trying this memorandum mainly as an exercise in relieving some of my
                            own frustrations.</p>
                        <p>I think we have come to a position of stall in our attempts to develop a
                            Washington consensus. For a week now the fundamental attitudes of the
                            principal officers of the Government have remained unchanged. The reason
                            for this is, I think, two-fold. First, the nature of the problem itself
                            tends to force the basic political outlooks within the President's
                            official family to the surface. On the one hand, <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell</persName> sees a world in which the only
                            successful way to resist the Communist menace is to provide the people
                            concerned with an alternative worth fighting for. On the other hand, to
                            Bob McNamara the issue is more than mechanical: if enough of the enemy
                            can be identified and killed by methods his department has been so
                            successful in developing, there will be time to concentrate on the
                            political and social welfare of the people in the countries where
                            insurgency exists. Each fundamentally views the other's position as an
                            impractical one. </p>
                        <p>Because of this difference in world views, I do not see how the
                            development of any further information is going to change conclusions.
                            This leads me to the conclusion that the governmental situation here
                            requires Presidential guidance. I am sure that there is a sufficiently
                            large reserve of loyal acquiescence in the official family to permit the
                            President to make a free choice on fundamental policy, but I am equally
                            sure that as time goes by and positions continue to harden, a
                            Presidential decision will become more painful. </p>
                        <p>Two other thoughts prompt me to hope for early Presidential action. The
                            first is that the longer we continue in an attitude of semipublic
                            fluidity, the worse the leak problem becomes. Until there is a policy
                            behind which to close ranks, the human tendency to influence decision by
                            every means at one's disposal will continue. My second thought is a
                            corollary to the first. General Krulak has just called me to complain
                            that our instruction to the field<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">
                                <ref target="#d97">Document 97</ref>.</note> to hold off major aid
                            decisions <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0262"/>is, in his view, a
                            back drawer way of effecting a policy which has not yet been agreed
                            upon. As time passes, General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName>'s point will become more valid and emotions will
                            start to rise again.</p>
                        <p>If the President is inclined to grasp the nettle, I have a thought on the
                            way he might do it. On the assumption that his political guidance will
                            be to the effect that we must attempt to bring about the changes in
                            policy and personnel which would restore to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> a fuller measure of its people's support, the President
                            might direct that the first phase of <persName>Roger</persName>'s
                            “pressure plan” be put into effect immediately. The President might
                            observe that, as a practical matter, the first phase is almost parallel
                            to the “policy of reconciliation” which Bob McNamara calls “Track 1”.
                            The significant difference is the political tone which the U.S. adopts
                            during this first phase. Instead of embracing the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and trying to endorse its public image,
                            we maintain the current public atmosphere of disapproval and tension. In
                            short, I am suggesting that the President approve a mechanical course
                            which I think would be acceptable to Bob McNamara while at the same time
                            setting a political tone which would be unacceptable but on which, I
                            think, the Secretary of Defense would quickly and sincerely defer to the
                            President's judgment. This might best be done by direct conversation
                            between the President and the Secretaries of State and Defense. Of
                            course we will inevitably have to face the problems implicit in phases
                            2, 3, etc.; but once the political direction has been set, we can get
                            back to the more logical and less emotional business of analyzing our
                            own actions in the light of their intrinsic value as tools to accomplish
                            our purpose.</p>
                        <p>Two items of incidental intelligence: <persName>Roger</persName> tells me
                            that he believes the Secretary of State is waiting for the President to
                            give a signal and is also very concerned (I think rightly) about
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s opinion. I
                            also have just had a talk with Greg Henderson, political officer in
                            Korea. He confirms very strongly that the Korean Government is watching
                            us in South Vietnam with great care. The Government-controlled press in
                            Seoul is advising us to stay out of internal affairs in Vietnam and in
                            Korea and to eschew aid as a means of influencing political development
                            in both countries.</p>

                        <p>On September 16, 1963, <persName corresp="#p_HD1">David
                                Halberstam</persName> reported in <hi rend="italic">The New York

                            States and South Vietnam over the strategic hamlet program in the Camau
                            peninsula, and to a lesser extent, in the Mekong Delta. In an article
                            entitled, “Rift With Saigon on War Tactics Underlined by 2 Red Attacks,”
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName> wrote that U.S.
                            officials in Vietnam were becoming increasingly concerned about the
                            vulnerability of isolated strategic hamlets in areas so long dominated
                            by the Viet Cong, and they reportedly called for an immediate halt of
                            construction of additional hamlets there. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName> claimed that the Vietnamese Government was
                            resisting U.S. pressure to consolidate in the peninsula and the Delta
                            and wished to continue to construct small hamlets.</p>

                        <p>Madame Chuong called me several times during the day and asked me to come
                            to her new house to discuss a “vital matter” with her. When I got there
                            at 8:00 p.m., I saw her alone. Ambassador Chuong was nowhere in sight,
                            although he called me this morning on a related matter.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Clandestine Government</p>
                        <p>Madame Chnong told me in conspiratorial tones that “many Vietnamese of
                            all parties” had asked her husband to head up a government of national
                            unity. When I asked for specific names, she mentioned Nguyen Ton Hoan
                            (Dai Viet, Paris), Pham Huy Co (exile, <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0264"/>Paris), and later also Bui Van Tinh (former Minister of
                            Interior and Ambassador to Japan). She said that her husband had never
                            wanted to get mixed up in “exile politics” but now the pressure on the
                            Chuongs was so great from so many Vietnamese to do something that she
                            was considering the idea and wanted my advice “as a friend”.</p>
                        <p>I said of course I had no advice, not even personal, to offer, but I
                            thought we would like to be kept informed of the progress of this
                            development. I said I assumed whatever “government” was created would
                            remain clandestine. She asked whether the U.S. would support such a
                            government. I did not respond to this but said I thought a surfaced
                            government could hardly obtain any form of recognition while the Diem
                            Government remained in power in Saigon. She said she was speaking of a
                            clandestine government and clandestine support. I left her further
                            queries unanswered other than to indicate again desire to be kept
                            informed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Madame Nhu</p>
                        <p>Madame Choong then said that she had told the Vietnamese community in New
                            York and Washington (who constantly came to her for guidance and advice)
                            that when the “wife of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>” came
                            they should “run her over with a car” (sic), and that if they could not
                            do that they should throw eggs and tomatoes at her every time she
                            appeared in public. She, Madame Chuong, had organized the White House
                            picket demonstration of Vietnamese recently and she was quite capable of
                            organizing against this “monster”.</p>
                        <p>(Ambassador Chuong called me first thing today to stress that <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> should under no circumstances
                            be received by high level U.S. officials, in particular the President.
                            If she knew now that she would not be received, she would be much less
                            likely to come. Her reason in coming is primarily to talk to top
                            officials; the press and TV are only a secondary concern.)</p>
                        <p>One more point conveyed, though somewhat indirectly, by Madame Chuong:
                            the U.S. is rapidly losing friends in Viet-Nam and is moving awfully
                            slowly in coping with the situation. There is only one solution; get rid
                            of both <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. The U.S. is responsible for doing
                            it because it is only through U.S. support that the government holds
                            together. All Vietnamese cordially hate it. Nhu is “un barbare” and Diem
                            is an incompetent. What is the U.S. waiting for?</p>
                        <p>I tried to handle her as tactfully as possible while retaining her
                            confidence.</p>

                            some time available and would like [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line

                            Khiem's initiative, discussion devoted to status of situation since
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>'s talk with <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> 31 August.<note n="2" xml:id="d119fn2">See <ref target="#d33">Document 33.</ref>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> very candid throughout,
                            was as usual thoughtful, but apparently straightforward. Answered
                            questions without hesitation.</p>
                        <p>2. The Generals are still acting within legality and plan continue doing
                            so as long as possible but becoming increasingly concerned over
                            additional evidence <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            negotiating for settlement with North.</p>
                        <p>3. Second week of September Generals formally requested President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to turn over to
                            military key Departments of Defense, Interior, Psychological Warfare,
                            and Education, proposing specific names as related in following
                            paragraph. President has taken proposal under consideration but has
                            already notified them that no decision will be made until after
                            elections are held.<note n="3" xml:id="d119fn3">See <ref target="#d155">Document 155</ref>.</note> Should proposal be turned down,
                            Generals prepared continue push in other (no amplification obtained)
                            directions.</p>
                        <p>4. For Defense, they have proposed Gen. Duong Van Minh, or <persName corresp="#p_TVDMG1">Tran Van Don</persName>, or <persName corresp="#p_NKMG1">Nguyen Khanh</persName>. They anticipate that if
                            decision is favorable, Gen. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>
                            will be chosen. For Interior, their candidate is <persName corresp="#p_TTDMG1">Ton That Dinh</persName>. Rationale is that Dinh
                            will be acceptable to Diem. For Psywar, either General <persName corresp="#p_TTOBG1">Tran Tu Oai</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_LVKBG1">Le Van Kim</persName>. For Education, Tran Van
                            Minh or Pham Xuan Chieu.</p>
                        <p>5. Counsellor <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has discussed
                            with some Generals (<persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>
                            stated he was not in on discussion and only mentioned <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_NGHIEM1">Nghiem</persName> as being among those with
                            whom <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> discussed the item) his
                            conversation with Polish Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Maneli</persName>. He told Generals that <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Maneli</persName> had brought him a proposal from <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Pham Van Dong</persName> for start of trade
                            between North and South Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had informed the Generals that he had taken this
                            under consideration and would consult with them in any future move.
                            According to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Maneli</persName> had stated that he was at
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s complete <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0266"/>disposal and ready to fly to Hanoi at a
                            moment's notice. Nhu had also stated that French Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Lalouette</persName> had also offered his services
                            toward same end.</p>
                        <p>6. In connection with necessity maintain utmost security at present
                            moment, <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> stated that the
                            key group is composed of three Generals: <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NKMG1">Nguyen
                                Khanh</persName>, and himself who only fully confide among
                            themselves. Allied Generals such as <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>, Chieu, and others are consulted only as need arises
                            but are not privy of all thoughts and planning of the triumvirate.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> pleased that as far
                            as he can determine, there has been no leak as to exactly what contacts
                            USG has had with any member of trio.</p>
                        <p>7. In a side note, <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> said
                            that General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> was acting
                            under instructions from Counsellor <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> when Conein was called in for interview. <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> had been instructed to
                            deliberately intimidate Conein, hence pointed guns prop during
                            interview. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 1ine not declassified</hi>]
                            did not ask source of <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>'s
                            info.</p>
                        <p>O. In another incidental comment, <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> said that General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> claims that an American official has offered him
                            the amount of 20 million plasters if he, <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>, would overthrow the government and has so reported
                            to Counsellor <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>9. In closing, <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> reiterated
                            that the Generals would under no condition go along with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> should he make any step toward the
                            North or even toward neutralization a la Laos.</p>

                            here. M said in that Agency there would be insurmountable problems
                            raised re this man—no confidence at all in him and M could assume no
                            responsibility for the operation. Sec said question of how he is hooked
                            on and the organization responsibilities do not have to follow the
                            particular pattern as in the letter. Missed what M said. Sec thinks it
                            should be talked out. If it is a policy question, that is one thing.
                            Other kinds of questions are another matter. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had a long talk this a.m. and within limits of
                            confidence etc. he seems to be thinking along the terms we are. M not
                            sure what terms are. This whole thing was built up by him through
                                <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Rufus Phillips</persName>. Lodge does
                            not know this fellow. Sec said <persName corresp="#p_LMGEG1">Lansdale</persName> denied this. This point seems fairly
                            incidental. Big job is getting something to Lodge that makes sense and
                            also consider how—bring him back or send someone out—not too keen on
                            Hawaii. M said you get him in town and then the press and Congress are
                            on him. This not so in Hawaii. M said the Unna article<note n="5" xml:id="d120fn5">Reference is to an article by <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Warren Unna</persName> in The Washington Post,

                                meeting. The transcription reads as follows: <p>“B returned the call
                                    and Sec thought at 5:30 the small group should meet first. B
                                    said that is the way it is. Only Sec, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> and AG will be there. Sec
                                    said key question is whether we bring him (<persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>) back. Question of
                                    message etc. B said Pres' reaction is against that but he has

                        <p>a. Paragraph 1. Unless it is desired to set up circumstances where
                            Reconciliation must be rejected as a barren course of action, it need
                            not be accepted that Reconciliation and Pressures and Persuasion must be
                            incompatible.</p>
                        <p>b. Paragraph 2. As long as the concept is retained that Reconciliation is
                            nothing more than total acquiescence on our part, the content of this
                            paragraph is correct. Under those circumstances Reconciliation would
                            have to be rejected. It would be preferable, however, to see Phase I and
                            Reconciliation both altered, to make them the very same. The revised
                            Phase I would embody expressions of dissatisfaction and sincere warning
                            on our part, coupled with hope, confidence, and a willingness to go
                            halfway with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in any genuine
                            action which he undertakes. As it stands now, neither Reconciliation nor
                            Pressures embodies this total philosophy. Reconciliation, as expressed,
                            has too little candor and too little bite. Pressures, as expressed,
                            dwells too much on the limitations of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and gives no evidence of US determination to help
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> wherever he exhibits
                            good faith.</p>
                        <p>c. Paragraph 3. This is speculation and, along with Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, I find no basis for real
                            benefit for <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> or South Vietnam
                            in such a sequence.</p>
                        <p>d. Paragraph 4. This suggests that <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> himself is not content with the program which he
                            has established.</p>
                        <p>e. Paragraph 5. If Phase I of the Pressures and Persuasion track were
                            designed to give <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> hope,
                            while still presenting a picture of the unfavorable future which he must
                            expect if he does not re-establish himself in the world opinion arena;
                            if; in addition, Phase I did not pivot on the elimination of Nhu but
                            only made plain to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> the
                            great benefits of reduction of Nhu's authority; if Phase I made clear
                            our willingness to participate in rehabilitating the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in the world's eye, <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0269"/>then there would be no problem of
                            switching from one policy to another as <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> describes it, because under this arrangement
                            there would only be one policy.</p>
                        <p>f. Paragraph 6. The long range plans of Nhu and the adequacy of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> national resolve to achieve victory are
                            facts that we cannot expect to have until matters are essentially
                            concluded.</p>
                        <p>g. Paragraph 7. To proceed, as <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> proposes, with initial steps aimed at the
                            elimination of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, without
                            offering hope to Diem regarding our own intentions, is indeed placing
                            our confidence in an informed hunch. However, to proceed along the lines
                            which I have described earlier, where Phase I has both strength and
                            conciliatory characteristics, changes this significantly.</p>
                        <p>3. To exemplify the shift which would make the idea of reconciliation
                            compatible with the idea of escalating pressure, I have made some
                            marginal notes and interlineations on a copy of the Pressures and
                            Persuasion approach.<note n="5" xml:id="d121fn5">Not printed.</note>
                            With those changes, I believe that the sequence of events is more
                            logical, and far more promising, than either of the cables in their
                            present form.</p>

                            and pursuant to a decision reached that day at the White House, to visit
                            Viet-Nam and report back promptly on the situation in that country. This

                                September 10, <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName>, who
                                had returned to Washington, sent the Embassy an additional report on
                                his visit to Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName>'s report covered a conversation he had
                                with the Dean of the Saigon University Law School, Va Quoc Thuc, who
                                predicted that Vietnam was on the verge of an explosive religious
                                war between Catholics and Buddhists. This pessimistic view,
                                Mendenhall stated in his telegram, “emphasized the gravity of the
                                political crisis in Viet-Nam.” (Department of State, Central Files,

                            September 10, 1963.</p>
                        <p>I arrived in Saigon at 6:00 a.m., September 8, and spent a few hours in
                            consultation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName>
                            (the <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>) and other Embassy officers and
                            attended a meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName>,

                            General Meede (Chief of Staff, <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>),
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> (who had a
                            similar mission on behalf of <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> as
                            mine) and Colonel Dunn (Assistant to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>).</p>
                        <p>At 10:30 a.m. I departed for Hue, and proceeded from there to Da Nang and
                            Nha Trang. I talked with as many knowledgeable people as I could at
                            these points, and returned to Saigon shortly after noon on September 9.
                            I spent the remainder of that day consulting with American and
                            Vietnamese officials, talked again with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, and left Saigon at 8:30 p.m.
                            September 9.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Situation in Viet-Nam</p>
                        <p>1. Saigon. I found a virtually complete breakdown of the civil government
                            in Saigon following the events of August 20, 1963. The Embassy has
                            reported that <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>, Secretary
                            of State for the Presidency and Assistant Secretary of State for
                            National Defense, felt useless, and that he stated he found Thanh,
                            Secretary of State for National Economy, reading a detective story
                            during office hours since the Ministry was not functioning. At a <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> meeting I attended, it was indicated
                            that the Ministry of Rural Affairs was likewise not functioning. The
                                <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Director stated that
                            Vietnamese officials in general did not want him to visit their offices
                            because of their fear of the consequences of being seen with Americans.
                            He added that in one case when he did visit a Vietnamese official in his
                            office, that official looked under all the objects in his office for
                            hidden microphones before he began to talk. Dean Vu Quoc Thuc also told
                            me he had offered his resignation as Dean of the Saigon University Law
                            School.</p>
                        <p>Saigon was heavy with an atmosphere of fear and hate. Fear is more
                            prevalent than it was in October, 1961, when General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> visited Viet-Nam on a special
                            Presidential mission. Then the fear had been created by Viet Cong
                            advances; this time, however, it arises from the reign of terror
                            conducted by the Government itself. Many high officials are not sleeping
                            at home because of their fear of arrest. I was warned immediately on
                            arrival that I must be <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0271"/>extremely careful about contacting Vietnamese friends because this
                            might compromise them with the regime. My actual contacts were arranged
                            circumspectly, and my friends' first remarks when I saw them were to the
                            effect how greatly the situation had worsened since my departure from
                            Viet-Nam a year ago.</p>
                        <p>The arrest of hundreds of students has had enormous effect on many
                            officials, both civilian and military, because these are their children
                            or nephews or nieces. Not only is this reflected in the attitude of
                            bitter dislike displayed by officials toward the Government, but the
                            Government's repression has also absorbed the attention of many
                            officials in attempting to protect their children or negotiate with the
                            police for their release.</p>
                        <p>The war against the Viet Cong has clearly receded to a secondary status
                            for the people of Saigon. As my Vietnamese contact indicated, their
                            first concern is now their “war” with the regime itself.</p>
                        <p>Dean <persName corresp="#p_THUC1">Thuc</persName> brought up with me the
                            explosive danger of a religious war between Buddhists and Catholics
                            which could be sparked by continued <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            repression of the Buddhists. As an example of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> “conciliatory” measures toward the Buddhists, I was
                            told that provincial bonzes had been released from prison and told to
                            return to their provinces, but their identification papers were retained
                            by the Government. Then on departure from Saigon they were arrested as
                            Viet Cong because of their lack of identity papers. Word of this quickly
                            spread through Saigon, with the result that a number of provincial
                            bonzes have taken refuge in various homes in Saigon, including those of
                            army officers.</p>
                        <p>Nhu is held clearly responsible by the people of Saigon for repression by
                            the Government—he is the focal point of their bitterness and hate.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has become increasingly
                            identified with Nhu as responsible for these measures, but this probably
                            does not represent a majority view except among the students.</p>
                        <p>Increasing reports are being received that students are talking of moving
                            over to the Viet Cong because of oppression by the Government. Also
                            significant in this connection was Dean <persName corresp="#p_THUC1">Thuc</persName>'s equating of the dangers from the Government and
                            the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>2. Mekong Delta Provinces (South of Saigon). Because of lack of time I
                            did not visit this area. In any case, the Buddhist problem has had no
                            impact there, apparently because of the easy-going attitude of the
                            Southerners on all matters, including religion.</p>
                        <p>I discussed the security situation in this area with the <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> who said that while there has been some
                            improvement in road security, the incident rate continues to be very
                            high. He also said that the number of armed Viet Cong is about 25,000 in
                            the country as a whole. He <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0272"/>described the strategic hamlet program in the Delta as a mess, largely
                            because of lack of coordination between the military and civilian
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>I had also intended to call on Colonel <persName corresp="#p_HVLC1">Hoang
                                Van Lac</persName>, Special Commissioner for Strategic Hamlets, to
                            get his assessment of the situation since his detached, experienced
                            judgment is valuable. I found, however, that his views had just been
                            obtained by Rufus Phillips of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>. Lac
                            confirmed the disorganized state of the strategic hamlet program in most
                            of the Delta provinces, and expressed the view that the war would be
                            lost by 1965 if the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is not
                            changed.</p>
                        <p>3. Provinces Just North of Saigon. I was informed by the Embassy
                            Political Officer in charge of internal affairs that security has much
                            improved in the Zone D area where Viet Cong installations have been
                            broken up and the area is now being cries-crossed by roads. However, the
                            Viet Cong have largely moved over from Zone D to the Duong Minh Chu
                            region in northern Tay Ninh province.</p>
                        <p>4. Central Plateau Provinces. Bad weather for flying, plus lack of time,
                            prevented a visit to this area. Since there are so few Vietnamese in
                            this region, there has, in any case, been no particular impact of the
                            Buddhist problem here.</p>
                        <p>In this area there has been substantial improvement in security over the
                            past year which is in important measure attributable to the programs
                            carried out with the Montagnards. Recent deterioration (presumably only
                            temporary) has occurred in Darlac Province where a new province chief,
                            in a literal application of strategic hamlet orders from Saigon, has
                            tried to recover part of the arms issued to certain Montagnard
                            villagers, and thus stirred up resentments. (This is a typical
                            provincial application, without judgment or discrimination, of orders
                            emanating from Nhu and/or Diem, and is prompted by the provincial
                            official's fear of the consequences if he fails to obey orders
                            completely.)</p>
                        <p>I was also informed [less than 1 1ine not declassified] that the Special
                            Forces border guards recently installed in areas close to the Laos
                            border have found many more Viet Cong in those areas than was previously
                            thought to be the case. It is impossible to state, however, whether this
                            represents an increase in Viet Cong in these areas since there is no
                            real previous base for comparison.</p>
                        <p>5. Central Coastal Provinces. I concentrated most of my brief stay in
                            Viet-Nam in this area, visiting Hue, Da Nang and Nha Trang. This is the
                            region (together with Saigon) where the Buddhist problem has been most
                            acute and has had the greatest impact.</p>
                        <p>I got a very good feel for the four northern provinces of <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Quang Tri</persName>, Thua Thien, Quang Nam and
                            Quang Tin. I found Hue and Da Nang cities of fear and hate, just like
                            Saigon. The civil bureaucracy in those cities, as well as the regional
                            civil service with its headquarters in <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0273"/>Hue, is riddled with bitter discontent over the
                            Government's repression. Students, civil servants and young officers in
                            the Hue area are reported to feel increasingly that they may as well
                            move over to the Viet Cong since the only reign of terror they know has
                            been that of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Province chiefs in these four provinces, on the other hand, are loyal to
                            the Government-not surprisingly since that appears to be the first
                            criterion for selection. District chiefs, to the extent their views were
                            known, are also considered loyal with one exception.</p>
                        <p>The armed forces in these four provinces presented a mixed picture. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 1ine not declassified</hi>] appears by his
                            conduct completely loyal. (One report I received was that he has been
                            bought by the Government for 2 million plasters. This could not be
                            confirmed, but my source stated Tri had plenty of cash, including
                            dollars.) The Corps G-2 and G-3 were described as strongly condemnatory
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s repression of the
                            Buddhists. Their future was uncertain following the removal of General
                            Nghiem as Corps Commander because of his Buddhist sympathies.</p>
                        <p>I was told that considerable dissatisfaction exists among lower-ranking
                            officers for political reasons, but the extent of this discontent is not
                            clear (partly because of limitations under which U.S. military officers
                            appear to operate in their relations with Vietnamese officers on
                            political and civilian matters). In any case, it is evident that the
                            armed forces continue to function as a disciplined force under current
                            circumstances. </p>
                        <p>The political dissatisfaction of both civilian and military officials is
                            vented almost completely on <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.
                            Diem appears largely to escape the same opprobrium.</p>
                        <p>Security in Quang Tin is deteriorating—August, 1963, was the worst month
                            since November, 1962. This province was described as generally poor from
                            a security standpoint. (This incidentally is a province where the
                            province chief was unanimously described to me as incompetent, but as
                            one who owed his job to his loyalty to the Government.) In Quang Nam,
                            where the Viet Cong had been gradually pushed back from coastal areas
                            over the past months, there is recent evidence of a reversal of this
                            trend (e.g., the nightly appearance of Viet Cong about 1000 meters from
                            the Special Forces training camp located about 10 kilometers from the
                            city of Da Nang). It is not clear whether the Buddhist issue has caused
                            or contributed to this worsening of security, but it is known that the
                            Buddhist agitation has extended to rural villages in Quang Nam and Thua
                            Thien. Reports from Hue have stated that in the latter province
                            villagers are beginning to opt for the Viet Cone</p>
                        <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0274"/>
                        <p>Aside from the four northern coastal provinces, time did not permit me to
                            get the same feel for the other coastal provinces. During my stop in Nha
                            Trang, I was only able to talk to U.S. military officers who, from their
                            limited vantage point, believed there was no Buddhist problem now in the
                            Nha Trang area, although that very morning a report had been received
                            (and was being checked) that a statue of Buddha had “miraculously”
                            sprung up about 20 kilometers out of Nha Trang. I had hoped to talk to
                            the [less than 1 1ine not declassified] but found he was absent. Reports
                            of this which I was later shown in Saigon stated that strong feelings
                            and an atmosphere of terror exist in the Nha Trang area in connection
                            with the Buddhist problem. I also got indications that this problem was
                            felt in varying degrees in Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Ninh Thuan, and Binh
                            Thuan provinces. </p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. If <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> remains in Viet-Nam,
                            thus retaining his power, the choice for the Vietnamese people will be
                            between <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and the Viet Cong. The evidence
                            indicates that, with this choice, the people will move in gradually
                            growing numbers toward the Viet Cong. I had thought on the basis of my
                            earlier tour of duty in Viet-Nam that the Vietnamese people might, under
                            such circumstances, begin to shift from anti-Communism to neutralism.
                            While these are small indications that neutralist thinking is indeed
                            developing, I came away from this visit convinced that the bitterness of
                            the Vietnamese over the recent oppression of the GVN will move them
                            increasingly all the way over to the Viet Cong unless rapid steps are
                            taken to remove <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. Both our
                                <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> in Saigon and our Consul in Hue
                            also believe this will be the case.</p>
                        <p>2. Thus, no matter how good our military measures are, it will not be
                            possible to win the guerrilla war if Nhu remains in power. One need only
                            recall Mao Tse-Tung's dictum of the guerrillas as fish and the people as
                            water. With the people increasingly hostile to the Government, its armed
                            forces cannot defeat the guerrillas. To cite one way in which security
                            is likely to deteriorate: There have been cases in Central Viet-Nam (not
                            specifically associated with recent political events) of strategic
                            hamlets betrayed from within, e.g., by leaving gates open or furnishing
                            Viet Cong with defense plans. This type of betrayal can be expected to
                            grow unless GVN policies and personnel are changed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation </p>
                        <p>That <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> be removed from Viet-Nam,
                            and that the U.S. take whatever action is necessary for this
                            purpose.</p>
                        <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0275"/>
                        <p>The U.S. responsibility vis-a-vis the Viet-Nam problem is inescapable:
                            Vietnamese pursue a constant refrain of asking what we Americans are
                            going to do about the situation in their country. When we reply that it
                            is up to them to act, they retort that the U.S. put the
                                Ngo family into power and gave it all the arms
                            it possesses, which are now being used against the people, not the
                            Communists. The U.S. can thus not escape responsibility whether it acts
                            or fails to act. A refusal to act would be just as much interference in
                            Viet-Nam's affairs as acting.</p>

                            INTRODUCE U.S. FORCES IN VIET-NAM</p>
                        <p>1. I wish to express my strong disagreement with the need to hinge our
                            doing anything in Viet-Nam to change the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> upon making a decision now to commit U.S. forces there,
                            as expressed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName> to the
                            Cabinet level meeting of 10 September, <note n="2" xml:id="d123fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#d83">Document 83</ref>.</note> and in his paper “A
                            Policy for Viet-Nam”.<note n="3" xml:id="d123fn3">
                                <ref target="#d81">Document 81</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName> stated that in order
                            to achieve the desirable policy objective of ousting the <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>s, without allowing the VC to make
                            unacceptable gains, it was necessary to decide in advance to introduce
                            U.S. Combat forces into Viet-Nam. Such a decision is necessary under all
                            circumstances according to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName>, because there is real danger that a successor
                            regime would be even more ineffective or that Vietnamese military forces
                            would fragment into rival camps.</p>
                        <p>3. The dangers Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName> has
                            cited certainly exist, however, he overstresses them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName> also overestimates Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s strength and the potential
                            opposition's weakness. If the opinions of many key Vietnamese who speak
                            as intimate friends can be considered evidence, <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0276"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> commands little true loyalty.
                            At present he has support from certain key military figures such as Col.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> and General Dinh but
                            this is based more on opportunism and on their loyalty to the President
                            than to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is a cold ruthless man who has on
                            occasion denigrated most of his followers in front of others. This has
                            earned him intense dislike along with fear and respect for his brains
                            but not deep loyalty.</p>
                        <p>4. Secondly, the officer corps is not as indecisive or divided as it may
                            seem to an outsider. The Generals did not launch a coup because they
                            lacked the troops, a plan, confidence in the U.S. support for the GVN as
                            well as word of support for the coup, and a sufficiently favorable
                            climate of opinion among the officer corps. The key missing item was
                            confidence in the U.S.-without some tangible evidence of U.S. support it
                            was extremely difficult if not impossible to rally the subordinate unit
                            commanders required. With the tide of sentiment running high in the
                            officer corps against the Nhus-it will not be difficult to mobilize this
                            sentiment if the U.S. acts. But words of criticism only have little
                            meaning. They have been heard before (after the 1960 coup, after the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Mission, etc.).</p>
                        <p>5. In my opinion it will not be necessary to go so far as to cut off all
                            aid. Selective cuts keyed to a carefully managed psychological warfare
                            campaign aimed at specific targets such as <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> and the Nhus will seriously undermine confidence in
                            the Nhus while restoring confidence in the U.S. A local “cold war” will
                            certainly ensue. We must be prepared for it with the necessary funds to
                            go around Saigon, if this is required, to keep the province program
                            moving. The crisis will require steady nerves and it will probably
                            produce retaliatory action by <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            such as the declaration of certain Americans persona non grata. We must
                            be prepared to stand our ground, request precise evidence and so forth,
                            and keep tightening the thumb screws. We must be careful to aim each
                            action at the Nhus, thus if the war effort is impaired the blame can be
                            pinned on the Nhus. Given the feelings of the officer corps against the
                            Viet Cong so heavily cited by the Defense Department, it is extremely
                            likely that they will act before the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            make any serious inroads.</p>
                        <p>6. Concerning the stability of any successor regime, the Generals have
                            declared and there is little reason to doubt their sincerity, that they
                            do not wish a military dictatorship. Many of them cite Korea as an
                            example of what they do not want. Detailed discussion, during the
                            preparatory period of the aborted coup, revealed that the Generals want
                            a mixed government with minor army participation. Their main interest
                            being to reform the army, the civil administration in the provinces so
                            that both would cooperate and fight the war with the degree <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0277"/>of spirit required to win. There is
                            some danger, of course, of a struggle for power but it is conditioned in
                            Viet-Nam by the need to work together in order to survive.</p>
                        <p>7. Certainly no one should rule out the possibility of the ultimate use
                            of U.S. troops and they should be ready to protect dependents if the
                            going gets rough before <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            topples but the entire policy should not be hinged on this contingency.
                            The use of U.S. troops to fight the war against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> would, in any case, be a mistake. The
                            Vietnamese are willing to fight and can fight. If we can help give them
                            a government worth fighting for, this single action will be worth more
                            than any number of U.S. troops.</p>
                        <p>8. This need to give the Vietnamese something worth fighting for and the
                            conclusion that the Vietnamese will fight to win for a government
                            without the Nhus are what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName> and I agree upon. However I believe he
                            underestimates the results of a determined psychological warfare
                            campaign by the U.S. (both covert and overt) to prepare the stage for a
                            successful overthrow of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> while
                            being too optimistic about the possible results of the direct use of US
                            forces.</p>

                            must for the present apply such pressures as are available to secure
                            whatever modest improvements on the scene may be possible. We think it
                            likely that such improvement can make a difference, at least in the
                            short run. Such a course, moreover, is consistent with more drastic
                            effort as and when means become available, and we will be in touch on
                            other channels<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">Not further

                        <p>4. Subject to your comment and amendment our own list of possible helpful
                            actions by government runs as follows in approximate order of
                            importance:</p>
                        <p>a. Clear the air—Diem should get everyone back to work and get them to
                            focus on winning the war. He should be broadminded and compassionate in
                            his attitude toward those who have, for understandable reasons, found it
                            difficult under recent circumstances fully to support him.</p>
                        <p>A real spirit of reconciliation could work wonders on the people he
                            leads; a punitive, harsh or autocratic attitude could only lead to
                            further resistance.</p>
                        <p>b. Buddhists and students—Let them out and leave them unmolested. This
                            more than anything else would demonstrate the return of a better day and
                            the refocusing on the main job at hand, the war.</p>
                        <p>c. Press—The press should be allowed full latitude of expression.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will be criticized, but
                            leniency and cooperation with the domestic and foreign press at this
                            time would bring praise for his leadership in due course. While
                            tendentious reporting is irritating, suppression of news leads to much
                            more serious trouble.</p>
                        <p>d. Secret and combat police—Confine its role to operations against the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and abandon operations against
                            non-Communist opposition groups thereby indicating clearly that a period
                            of reconciliation and political stability has returned.</p>
                        <p>e. Cabinet changes to inject new untainted blood, remove targets of
                            popular discontent.</p>
                        <p>f. Elections—These should be held, should be free, and should be widely
                            observed.</p>
                        <p>g. Assembly—Assembly should be convoked soon after the elections. The
                            government should submit its policies to it and should receive its
                            confidence. An Assembly resolution would be most useful for external
                            image purposes.</p>

                            perhaps be best accomplished by disbanding the party and starting
                            afresh.</p>

                        <p>5. You may wish to add or subtract from the above list, but need to set
                            psychological tone and image is paramount. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has taken positive actions in past of greater or
                            less scope than those listed, but they have had little practical
                            political effect since they were carried out in such a way as to make
                            them hollow or, even if real, unbelievable (e.g., martial law already
                            nominally lifted, Assembly elections scheduled, and puppet bonzes
                            established).</p>
                        <p>6. Specific “reforms” are apt to have little impact without dramatic,
                            symbolic move which convinces Vietnamese that reforms are real. As
                            practical matter we share your view that this can best be achieved by
                            some visible reduction in influence of Nhus, who are symbol to
                            disaffected of all that they dislike in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. This we think would require Nhus departure from Saigon
                            and preferably Vietnam at least for extended vacation. We recognize the
                            strong possibility that these and other pressures may not produce this
                            result, but we are convinced that it is necessary to try.</p>
                        <p>7. In Washington, in this phase, we would plan to maintain a posture of
                            disapproval of recent <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> actions, but
                            we would not expect to make public our specific requests of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. Your comment on public aspects
                            of this phase is particularly needed.</p>
                        <p>8. We note your reluctance to continue dialogue with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> until you have more to say, but
                            we continue to believe that discussions with him are at a minimum an
                            important source of intelligence and may conceivably be a means of
                            exerting some persuasive effect even in his present state of mind. If
                            you believe that full control of U.S. assistance provides you with means
                            of resuming dialogue, we hope you will do so. We ourselves can see much
                            virtue in effort to reason even with an unreasonable man when he is on a
                            collision course. We repeat, however, that this is a matter for your
                            judgment.</p>
                        <p>9. Meanwhile, there is increasing concern here with strictly military
                            aspects of the problem, both in terms of actual progress of operations
                            and of need to make effective case with Congress for continued
                            prosecution of the effort. To meet these needs, President has decided to
                            send Secretary of Defense and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to Vietnam, arriving early next week. It will be
                            emphasized here that it is a military mission and that all political
                            decisions are being handled through you as President's senior
                            representative.</p>
                        <p>10. We repeat that political program outlined above awaits your comment
                            before final decision. President particularly emphasizes that it is
                            fully open to your criticism and amendment. It is obviously an interim
                            plan and further decisions may become necessary very soon.</p>

                        <p>1. If Secretary of Defense and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> come to Viet-Nam, they will have to call on
                            President Diem and I will have to accompany them. This will be taken
                            here as a sign that we have decided to forgive and forget and will be
                            regarded as marking the end of our period of disapproval of the
                            oppressive measures which have been taken here since last May. It would
                            certainly put a wet blanket on those working for a change of government.
                            The family are only too anxious to promote the idea that everything is
                            finished and cleared up, and we should now go ahead and win the war.</p>
                        <p>2. Believe, therefore, that Secretary of Defense and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> should come with eyes open
                            knowing that this is what the reaction will be. It is quite impossible
                            at their level to distinguish between the political and military.</p>
                        <p>3. I have been observing a policy of silence which we have reason to
                            believe is causing a certain amount of apprehension and may just be
                            getting the family into the mood to make a few concessions. The effect
                            of this will obviously be lost if we make such a dramatic demonstration
                            as that of having the Secretary of Defense and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> come out here.<note n="3" xml:id="d126fn3">

                        <p>1. We can make it clear here, and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> can make it clear in Saigon to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, that this visit is not designed to
                            bring comfort to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. My own
                            thought is that in any visit <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> makes to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> he will want to speak some home truths on the
                            military consequences of the current difficulties, and also to make it
                            clear that the United States Government is not open to oriental divisive
                            tactics.</p>
                        <p>2. We can readily set up this visit as one which you and I have decided
                            on together, or even as one which is sent in response to your own
                            concern about winning the war in the current situation. For example, we
                            could announce that the purpose of the mission is to consider with you
                            the practical ways and means of carrying out my announced policy that we
                            will support activities which will further the war effort in South
                            Vietnam and avoid supporting activities which do not. The whole cast of
                            the visit will be that of military consultation with you on the
                            execution of the policy which you and I have determined.</p>
                        <p>3. As our last message<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">
                                <ref target="#d125">Document 125</ref>.</note> said, my own central
                            concern in sending this mission is to make sure that my senior military
                            advisers are equipped with a solid on-the-spot understanding of the
                            situation, as a basis both for their participation in our councils here,
                            and for the Administration's accounting to the Congress on this
                            critically important contest with the Communists. Having grown up in an
                            Ambassador's house, I am well trained in the importance of protecting
                            the effectiveness of the man on-the-spot, and I want to handle this
                            particular visit in a way which contributes to and does not detract from
                            your own responsibilities. But in the tough weeks which I see ahead, I
                            just do not see any substitute for the ammunition I will get from an
                            on-the-spot and authoritative military appraisal.</p>
                        <p>4. I do not think I can delay announcement of the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> mission beyond Saturday,<note n="3" xml:id="d128fn3">September 20.</note> and I will be grateful
                            for a further prompt comment on this message<note n="4" xml:id="d128fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> advised the President
                                in a message transmitted in telegram 540 from Saigon, September 19,
                                received at 11:18 p.m., September 18, as follows: <p>“Believe it
                                    would be helpful if you could announce that I had asked

                                        <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to come to
                                    consider with me ways and means of carrying out your policy.
                                    They can indeed be most helpful to me.</p>
                                <p>“Believe we cannot avoid a call by <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, and myself on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, and we must make every
                                    effort that this call does not look like an endorsement.”

                            Secretary.</p>
                        <p>1. Dinner last night with Ambassador and Mrs. Goburdhun (Chairman of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> in Vietnam), brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, Foreign Minister Cuu, my wife, and
                            me.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was extremely talkative. He
                            repeated time and again that it was he who had invented the strategic
                            hamlets, that everyone, including the Americans, had said he couldn't do
                            it but that he had done it. He reiterated time and again that the
                            Buddhists had been murdered and had not committed suicide.</p>
                        <p>3. In all this Cuu was a faithful echo. But when Cuu said that the
                            Buddhist corpses had been found with their arms straight instead of
                            folded, Mrs. Goburdhun intervened with some heat and said that this had
                            not been the case.</p>
                        <p>4. I have all along suspected that Nhu had promoted the dinner so I did
                            not bring anything up, but waited for him. I was not disappointed. After
                            awhile he said he could quite understand how Americans were naturally
                            horrified to think that they were supporting conditions which were so
                            bad that Buddhist priests were killing themselves. And he said he could
                            quite understand why Senator Church had put in his resolution<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">See <ref target="#d84fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    84</ref>.</note> (copy of which I had already sent to
                            Palace).</p>
                        <p>5. I said I was glad he understood it, adding that he should realize that
                            in the last few days four more Senators had added their names and that
                            it would not be difficult to get enough signatures to guarantee a
                            majority. This would be a body blow to foreign aid.</p>
                        <p>6. He then said that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was the leader of the Free World and that he
                            must save President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s
                            face.</p>
                        <p>7. I said that I was not worrying about President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s face but about our joint
                            ability, Vietnamese and Americans, as partners, to carry out the program
                            and that one of the things which endangered the program was the
                            extremely bad publicity which there had been <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0285"/>ever since last May and which had created grave doubts
                            as to whether the program was worthy of support. I said something should
                            be done to show Americans there had been a real improvement and it was
                            for that reason that I had suggested that he go away for awhile at least
                            until December so as to provide an opportunity to get the appropriation
                            bill passed. I said I realized that he and the President, in principle,
                            were in favor of atoning to the Buddhists, but that President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had to do something symbolic
                            which would hopefully provide some material for a photograph.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said: I don't care for
                            myself; I would be glad to do anything. We must do whatever is
                            necessary. But if I go away it will hurt the morale of the Republican
                            Youth which is so essential to victory. But I will be glad to do
                            whatever is necessary. All along he kept stressing the vital importance
                            of the Republican Youth and never once mentioned the Army.</p>
                        <p>9. As we broke up, I said several times: I hope to hear from you very
                            soon.</p>
                        <p>10. This meeting certainly gave me the chance to make the point I wanted
                            to make and it was a meeting which, I am sure, he (and not I) had
                            arranged. This made for a tone most favorable to me and put me in a much
                            stronger position than if I had sought an audience.</p>
                        <p>11. Frankly, I am not impressed by his statement that he is willing to do
                            anything because actually he isn't.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is always a striking
                            figure. He has a handsome, cruel face and is obviously very intelligent.
                            His talk last night was like a phonograph record and, in spite of his
                            obvious ruthlessness and cruelty, one feels sorry for him. He is wound
                            up as tight as a wire. He appears to be a lost soul, a haunted man who
                            is caught in a vicious circle. The Furies are after him.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Agree that no good opportunity for action to remove present government
                            in immediate future is apparent and that we should, therefore, do
                            whatever we can as an interim measure pending such an eventuality.</p>
                        <p>2. Virtually all the topics under paragraph 4, letters a to m, have been
                            taken up with Diem and Nhu at one time or another, most of them by me
                            personally. They think that most of them would either involve destroying
                            the political structure on which they rest or loss of face or both. We,
                            therefore, could not realistically hope for more than lip service.
                            Frankly, I see no opportunity at all for substantive changes. Detailed
                            comments on items a to m are contained in separate telegram.<note n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">

                        <p>3. There are signs that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> are
                            somewhat bothered by my silence. According to one well placed source,
                            they are guessing and off-balance and “desperately anxious” to know what
                            US posture is to be. They may be preparing some kind of a public
                            relations package, possibly to be opened after the elections. I believe
                            that for me to press <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> on
                            things which are not in the cards and to repeat what we have said
                            several times already would be a little shrill and would make us look
                            weak, particularly in view of my talk with Nhu last night at a dinner
                            where I had a golden opportunity to make the main points of your CAP
                            63516 as reported in 541.<note n="4" xml:id="d130fn4">

                        <p>4. Also, I doubt that a public relations package will meet needs of
                            situation which seems particularly grave to me, notably in the light of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName>'s opinion
                            expressed very privately yesterday that the Viet Cong are steadily
                            gaining in strength; have more of the population on their side than has
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>; that arrests are continuing and

                        <p>5. As regards your paragraph 3 on withholding of aid, I still hope that I

                                <ref target="#d86">Document 86</ref>.</note> which will enable us to
                            apply sanctions in a way which will really affect <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> without precipitating an economic collapse and
                            without impeding the war effort. We are studying this here and have not
                            yet found a solution. If a way to do this were to be found, it would be
                            one of the greatest discoveries since the enactment of the Marshall Plan
                            in 1947 because, so far as I know, the US has never yet been able to
                            control any of the very unsatisfactory governments through which we have
                            had to work in our many very successful attempts to make these countries
                            strong enough to stand alone.</p>
                        <p>6. I also believe that whatever sanctions we may discover should be
                            directly tied to a promising coup d'etat and should not be applied
                            without such a coup being in prospect. In this connection, I believe
                            that we should pursue contact with <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big
                                Minh</persName> and urge him along if he looks like acting. I
                            particularly think that the idea of supporting a Vietnamese Army
                            independent of the government should be energetically studied.</p>
                        <p>7. I will, of course, give instructions that programs which can be
                            effectively held up should be held up and not released without my
                            approval provided that this can be done without serious harmful effect
                            to the people and to the war effort. Technical assistance and dollar
                            support to communications support programs may be one way. This would be
                            a fly-speck in the present situation and would have no immediate effect,
                            but I hope that it may get Vietnamese officials into the habit of asking
                            me to release items which are held up and that, over a long period of
                            time, it might create opportunities for us to get little things
                            done.</p>
                        <p>8. But it is not even within the realm of possibility that such a
                            technique could lead them to do anything which causes loss of face or
                            weakening of their political organization. In fact, to threaten them
                            with suppression of aid might well defeat our purposes and might make a
                            bad situation very much worse.</p>
                        <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0288"/>
                        <p>9. There should in any event be no publicity whatever about this
                            procedure. If it is possible to halt a program, I intend to appear not
                            as a czar but as one who will try to do his best to put the item back on
                            the track.</p>
                        <p>10. As regards your paragraph 6 and “dramatic symbolic moves”, I really
                            do not think they could understand this even if Thao wanted to, although
                            I have talked about it to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>,
                            and to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> last night (see my
                            541). They have scant comprehension of what it is to appeal to public
                            opinion as they have really no interest in any other opinion than their
                            own. I have repeatedly brought up the question of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s departure and have stressed that
                            if he would just stay away until after Christmas, it might help get the
                            appropriation bill through. This seems like a small thing to us but to
                            them it seems tremendous as they are quite sure that the army would take
                            over if he even stepped out of the country.</p>
                        <p>11. Your para 8. I have, of course, no objection to seeing <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> at any time that it would be
                            helpful. But I would rather let him sweat for awhile and not go to see
                            him unless I have something really new to bring up. I would much prefer
                            to wait until I find some part of the aid program to hold up in which he
                            is interested and then have him ask me to come and see him. For example,
                            last night's dinner which I suspect <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> of stimulating is infinitely better than for me to
                            take the initiative for an appointment and to call at the office.
                            Perhaps my silence had something to do with it.</p>

                        <p>a. Clear the air. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is, of
                            course, in a sense already trying to get everyone back to work and
                            focussed on winning the war. That is, he would like them to forget or
                            ignore or accept his interpretation of recent events. He is in his
                            present situation precisely because he took a deliberate decision not to
                            be broadminded and compassionate and not to adopt a real spirit of
                            reconciliation. Much the same comment applies as in a.</p>
                        <p>[b.] <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will not let any of the
                            leadership elements out unless he is satisfied that they are thoroughly
                            cowed and will cause no further trouble. He will not leave them
                            unmolested if they turn out to be uncowed. His whole approach with
                            Buddhists and students has been to terrorize them. If he were now able
                            to convince students, for example, that they would not be molested,
                            chances are very great that demonstrations, etc., would get completely
                            out of hand. This is on assumption that there had not been
                            simultaneously a radical change in the government.</p>
                        <p>c. Press. For the moment foreign press appears to be operating as freely
                            as before August 20, censorship is off, dispatches are going through
                            without delay. I do not think <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would consider changing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policies on domestic press.</p>
                        <p>d. Secret and combat police. This would be equivalent to asking <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to tie both hands behind his
                            back. He will abandon operations against opposition when he is satisfied
                            they are no longer a proximate threat and resume them when he concludes
                            that they are.</p>
                        <p>e. Cabinet changes. Popular discontent does not run particularly to the
                            Cabinet but to the family. I should not be surprised to see some Cabinet
                            reshuffling after elections, but I would not expect it to have any
                            measurable effect on popular attitudes, since public would not expect
                            new blood to have any more authority than the old. For example, there is
                            a brand new Foreign Secretary, Mr. Cuu, and he is the most shameless
                            sycophant I have ever seen.</p>
                        <p>f. Elections. These are now ten days away. We have already reported
                            before elections postponed that there are only about half as many
                            candidates as the last time and that there was widespread apathy among
                            voters. Elections will not be a meaningful expression of popular will
                            and could not at this stage be made to seem so, even with most skillful
                            press agentry. Government will probably have to make massive and well
                            observed effort to get voters to polls.</p>
                        <p>g. Assembly. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> may well submit policies
                            to Assembly for vote of confidence, but I do not really believe that
                            this will have much effect on the “external image.”</p>

                        <p>h. Party. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> might conceivably
                            agree to abolish Can Lao party. However, as we have previously
                            estimated, something else would immediately be created to take its
                            place, because a secret political organization is an essential part of
                            the family's power base and scheme of operation.</p>
                        <p>i. Decree No. 10. Possibly something can be done on this.</p>

                            to couch this in the most diplomatic possible language while at the same
                            time making clear that you can inquire in any area whatever. In
                            particular, note the language about “refining” our present policy.<note n="3" xml:id="d133fn3">Reference is to a sentence in the <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> draft in the last paragraph

                                to be carried out in a concerted fashion by US representatives in

                            well be added as an initial sub-paragraph for what you would say to

                            Mac on the phone, but will be working with him just as soon as we can
                            get together. For your information, he may bring up the suggestion that
                            State be represented not by <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt
                                Rostow</persName> but by Marshall Green, <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>'s new deputy. Green is a very old friend of both
                            Mac and myself and is a particularly good observer, unscarred by
                            emotions. In many ways, I would consider him preferable to Walt, and it
                            may well be that he would also sit better with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName>.</p>

                        <p>1. As everyone else seems to be talking, writing and confusing the issue
                            here in Vietnam, it behooves me to also get into the act. From most of
                            the reports and articles I read, one would say Vietnam and our programs
                            here are falling apart at the seams. Well, I just thoroughly
                            disagree.</p>
                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> is divided into two parts,
                            Saigon with its satellite Hue and the remainder of the country. In
                            Saigon one can hear any imaginable rumor or grievance one wants to hear
                            and I suppose could get better ones for a price.</p>
                        <p>Thank goodness I do not get to read the newspapers until they are at
                            least three days old. If I got them as soon as you do, I would be afraid
                            to go to work or I wouldn't know what to do. All is not black. No, far
                            from it.</p>
                        <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0293"/>
                        <p>3. As you know, our programs are pointed towards the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and the people in the countryside.
                            None are designed for Saigon.</p>
                        <p>The programs for the Armed Forces are completed or on schedule. The ones
                            in the country continue without let-up. Both are paying dividends.</p>
                        <p>4. I remain as optimistic as ever, particularly on the military side and
                            I firmly believe there is reason for optimism in some of the other
                            spheres.</p>
                        <p>Here are some of the indicators.</p>
                        <p>a. Martial law has been lifted.</p>
                        <p>b. Press censorship relaxed.</p>
                        <p>c. The rapid reaction by <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> in
                            countering several larger than usual <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            attacks and the impressive results obtained by the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> counter forces as regards both
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> killed and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> supplies and equipment captured.</p>
                        <p>d. The voluntary movement by the heretofore reluctant Behnar Montagnards
                            tribesmen in the Pleiku area seeking resettlement and government
                            protection.</p>
                        <p>3. [e.] The obvious interest displayed at all levels of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> to get on with the war against the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. This particularly apparent since
                            the lifting of martial law.</p>
                        <p>f. The obvious desire evidenced on the part of <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> personnel to further develop rapport and
                            understanding with their US adviser counterparts.</p>
                        <p>g. As reported in the most recent Task Force Saigon Weekly Program Report
                            (Saigon A-204 to State 16 Sep)<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2">Not printed.

                        <p>(1) Although business continued slow the shortened curfew (now relaxed)
                            and lengthened business day allowed more general circulation of people
                            throughout the area. Restaurants and theaters renewed evening activities
                            and taxi and cyclo-posse were available until late.</p>
                        <p>(2) Rice and hog deliveries to Saigon from province not affected by
                            martial law and local curfew. Small increase in daily rice deliveries
                            over August. Hog deliveries only slightly less than before with
                            wholesale price steady.</p>
                        <p>(3) Trend toward normal relations between <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> technicians and counterparts continued.</p>
                        <p>(4) <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> provincial representatives
                            continue to report province programs outside Delta problem areas going
                            well and Inter-Ministerial Committee efficiency returning to normal.
                            Provincial operations normal or nearly so with exception of Thua Thien.
                            Individual programs remained on schedule.</p>
                        <p>(5) All Corps have made comparable consistent progress during period in
                            hamlet completions.</p>

                            opened. Project financed by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will

                        <p>5. These and others are indications that our programs are moving. We must
                            not stop them and let fourteen million people go down the Communist
                            drain. Admittedly we are on the front-line and the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are using every trick in their bag.
                            Murders, ambush, propaganda, Buddhists, and school children all are part
                            of their game. They know they're losing and are going to desperate ends
                            to hang on. We can not give up now.</p>

                        <p>1. Ex-Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Tran Van Chuong</persName>
                            called on me today at his request. The purpose was to warn me against
                            the optimistic reports on the military situation coming from military
                            officials in South Vietnam. He is convinced that the basic facts are
                            quite different. He thinks that there can be no final victory with the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government which is
                            more disliked by the people of the country than was the government of
                            Bao Dai.</p>
                        <p>2. He recited his resistance to the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> program and his efforts to change the character of
                            the Administration. In July 1962, he wrote a very strong letter to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> urging him to become a
                            political figurehead <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0295"/>while
                            retaining the position of President and giving the real political power
                            to a Prime Minister. He resigned this year after seeing the
                            ineffectiveness of his recommendations for change.</p>
                        <p>3. He stresses the predominant importance of Saigon, not only as the
                            capitol and population center but also as being the “heart and brains”
                            of South Vietnam. Hence, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s
                            unpopularity in Saigon has a particular significance.</p>
                        <p>4. I told him that I hoped to revisit South Vietnam fairly soon and asked
                            how I could learn the true situation, who were some senior civilians
                            with whom I might talk and exchange views. <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Tran Van Chuong</persName> replied that it was impossible since it
                            would be too dangerous for such civilians to communicate with me.</p>
                        <p>5. I urged him to think over the problem of a foreign official trying to
                            understand the situation in Vietnam and to telephone me if he had any
                            constructive suggestions.</p>

                        <p>1. Since May 8, and especially since August 21, discontent in Vietnamese
                            society has been accompanied by a spread of fear, uncertainty and
                            frustration regarding the future, and in some instances, transformed
                            into disaffection. Morale has been badly hit, particularly among</p>
                        <p>a. the top echelons of the Vietnamese Government;</p>
                        <p>b. the civilian bureaucracy;</p>
                        <p>c. the urban professionals;</p>
                        <p>d. the intellectuals;</p>
                        <p>e. the students;</p>
                        <p>f. some levels of the police and security forces.</p>
                        <p>The military, thus far, have been the least affected.</p>
                        <p>2. There is overwhelming feeling among Vietnamese that</p>
                        <p>a. <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> is the real power
                            in the Vietnamese Government;</p>
                        <p>b. Mr. and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> are mainly to
                            blame for the disastrous course of events and must be ousted.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> are generally considered “twins”,
                            but considerable (nostalgic) hope remains that they may yet be separated
                            and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> retained thereafter as
                            the head of a new government.</p>
                        <p>4. Discontent has in some cases become intense disaffection; but talk
                            will be transformed into action only if the US encourages this and takes
                            the lead.</p>
                        <p>5. The feeling is widespread that the US must provide stimulus and
                            backing for the overthrow of the regime and construction of a new one.
                            The US is regarded with hope, disappointment, and, more recently, with
                            criticism and resentment. United States responsibility for the continued
                            tenure of the Ngo family is repeatedly cited;
                            similarly, the US is blamed for having enabled the regime to prevent the
                            development of an alternative leadership.</p>
                        <p>6. Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NNTV1">Nguyen Ngoc Tho</persName>
                            is considered a possible successor to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, but would require Vietnamese military
                            backstopping. He is regarded as a good administrator, capable, honest,
                            and a suitable titular head of state, but not as a strong man.</p>
                        <p>7. The generals are considered the group most likely to be able to bring
                            about a change in the government; but even they will move only if the US
                            prods them to do so.</p>
                        <p>8. The ideas of Buddhist leader <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                Quang</persName> do not go beyond overthrowing the present regime;
                            he appears as a religious revolutionary with agitational ideas and
                            potential, but without institutional or constructive ideas.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s neutralist
                            proposals have been received by the Vietnamese with little interest or
                            support.</p>
                        <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0297"/>
                        <p>10. The Viet Cong is regarded with strong hostility. However, because the
                            belief is growing that the US cannot be counted on, and the Viet Cong
                            can, and that life under the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would
                            be no worse than that under the Ngo regime, the
                            Viet Cong are being mentioned as an undesirable, but possibly the only,
                            alternative to the present government.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy adds, in its own overall commentary, that there is little
                            question that continuation of the present situation will be increasingly
                            exploited by the Viet Cong and will increasingly sap <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> capabilities.</p>
                        <p>11. The student uprisings are extremely serious, and have alarmed
                            Vietnamese officials and military more than any other evidences of
                            popular disaffection.</p>

                        <p>1. Here is what I have done in compliance with your paragraph 3:</p>
                        <p>a. I read pertinent parts to Chief of <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            and Chief of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> asking them to let me
                            know of any programs which could be held up without impairing the war
                            effort. I am not sure whether anything significant will be found in
                            these two agencies.</p>
                        <p>b. I requested Chief of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> to notify
                            me of any of his programs which could be held up and which would give
                            concern to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> without disrupting the Vietnamese
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>2. Chief of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> suggested holding up on
                            technical assistance and dollar support for the communications program
                            conducted by the Vietnamese Director of Information; and continue
                            holding up for a very short time on support of the commercial import
                            program. I stipulated that this last should not be held up so that it
                            would in any way create inflation, panic, or injury to the standard of
                            living of the masses.</p>
                        <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0298"/>
                        <p>3. When Vietnamese officials call to inquire about these two programs,
                            they are to be told that President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will have to speak to me about it. If he asks me to
                            come and see him, I will, of course, go-which will be the first time
                            that I will have been asked to do him a favor. There will then be
                            several different ways for me to handle the matter. I am thinking now of
                            listening to his request that the program be set in motion again and
                            then doing to him in reverse the kind of thing which he does to me; that
                            is, launch into a long statement on something that interests me, to wit,
                            how urgent it is for him to take action so that it will appear in
                            America that there has been some real improvement in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Getting <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to bring about an improvement in
                            the appearance of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is a prime
                            responsibility of mine, and I shall try to leave no stone unturned. I
                            believed, however, that we might face a situation after the
                            appropriation bill has been voted in which no coup d'etat has taken
                            place and in which we are faced with the simple but unpleasant choice of
                            pressing on vigorously with Diem and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> or else not pressing on at all. Under these
                            circumstances, I think we should definitely press on and that my job
                            will then be to develop as much influence with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> as possible, to advise and guide them, and, when
                            expedient, to do favors for them. For this reason, I do not want to burn
                            any bridges without your knowledge and approval.</p>

                        <p>556. Following are highlights of statements made to U.S. officer
                            September 18 by General <hi rend="italic">“Big” Minh</hi>. Statements
                            were touched off by officer's request for <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>'s evaluation of Viet Cong situation:</p>
                        <p>1. Minh thought <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> were gaining steadily
                            in strength and 80 percent of population now have no basis for choice
                            between <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0299"/>
                        <p>2. Lifting of martial law was simply eyewash for Americans. The situation
                            remains the same. Arrests were continuing, and <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> remarked that the two guardhouses
                            outside his headquarters were full of prisoners.</p>
                        <p>3. Student problem had by no means been resolved and was in fact very
                            grave. Minh said he knew that students were going over to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> but cited no numbers or facts in
                            support.</p>
                        <p>4. Middle ranks of Army were badly disaffected and were asking for a
                            coup. According to <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>,
                            officers were not fighting aggressively because they do not have their
                            heart in it. With the proper government, they would fight “four times
                            harder.”</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> felt sure that Nhu was in
                            charge. Said when he took military problems to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> these days, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> either referred him to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> or called <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> in.</p>
                        <p>6. Minh claimed that every District Chief and Province Chief was Can Lao
                            Party member and charged that these officials were demanding and
                            receiving kick-backs from rural population on U.S. aid extended.
                            Proceeds were going into party coffers. Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_THUC1">Thuc</persName>, according to <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, was “attending to everything but
                            church business.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> gave impression of having
                            thought very carefully about coup possibilities but gave no indication
                            as to whether or not he might be actively planning a coup. In
                            hypothetical terms, he said that coup would have to be carried out
                            suddenly and with complete success, so as to leave no opportunity for
                            Viet Cong exploitation and to avoid risk of civil war.</p>
                        <p>Asked by U.S. officer whether his visit embarrassed <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, latter replied in the negative.
                            He said that he had been told, like everyone else, to stay away from
                            Americans but order was not in writing and he had made it clear that he
                            would not sacrifice his old friendships. He would be glad to see U.S.
                            officer at any time.</p>

                            rumors that were still going around Saigon. I said one of the rumors was
                            that he (<persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>) wanted to
                            resign and get out of the country. He categorically denied this and said
                            it was fantastic. He said any such rumor that could be spread around
                            deeply endangered his life. He said that he was discouraged for a time
                            and that his health was not too good and that he said he thought he
                            would like to have an Ambassador's post some place. He asked me to
                            please try to “squelch” even the discussion of such a rumor that he
                            wanted to resign or that he could get anybody else to go with him.</p>
                        <p>Ref B (556) which is an unevaluated statement by General <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">(Big) Minh</persName>: I have this to say—since
                            I have known <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> a year
                            and one-half, though I have a very high estimate of his leadership
                            qualities, he has contributed nothing to the war effort here either as
                            commander of the field command or as an advisor to the President. In
                            fact, he has done nothing but complain to me about the government and
                            the way it is handled ever since I have been here. As you know,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> has been under
                            suspicion since 1960 and has never been given real command of troops
                            since that time and he has been kept in positions where people keep a
                            close watch on him. My intelligence people, in analyzing his statement,
                            feel this: that he might have been again attempting to probe the US
                            position to elicit an expression of support for a coup. This was
                                <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>'s first meeting with
                            Americans since the 21st of August and this might also explain his
                            eagerness to communicate his views. The statement that 80 percent of the
                            populace no longer supports the government can certainly not be
                            confirmed. We <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0301"/>have no evidence
                            to indicate that numbers of students are turning in desperation to the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, though there is some element of
                            collusion between student group leaders and the National Liberation
                            Front.</p>
                        <p>At the meeting today with all senior advisers, none evidenced any
                            disaffection of the middle ranks.</p>
                        <p>As I have said before, you can get almost any viewpoint you want and some
                            of these indicate there are still coup discussions going on among the
                            military. We will continue to evaluate all statements as well as we are
                            able.</p>

                        <p>On September 21, 1963, Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s queries about the veracity of
                            the article in <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> by <persName corresp="#p_HD1">David Halberstam</persName>, September 16 (see <ref target="#d117">Document 117</ref>). <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s signed memorandum to the President, September
                            19, reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“In your memorandum dated 16 September 1963, you inquired as to the
                            accuracy of subject article and whether there is a split between our
                            military and the Vietnamese on the strategic hamlet program in the Delta
                            area.</p>
                        <p>“Attached is an analysis, based upon reports received from the U.S.
                            Military Assistance Command, as well as country team statistics. It
                            indicates that there is no rift between our military and the Vietnamese
                            on the program and that the article contains other inaccuracies.”

                            330, OSD Files: FRC 69 A 3131, Vietnam-1)</p>
                        <p>The attached analysis referred to by <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was 19 pages long and dated September 20. In
                            it, the Department of Defense maintained that the United States and
                            South Vietnam differed over strategic hamlets in the Camau peninsula and
                            the Delta, but agreed on goals and strategy for the program. According
                            to the analysis, <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName>
                            underestimated the effectiveness of the Armed Forces of the Republic of
                            Vietnam, overemphasized Viet Cong successes, and failed to mention the
                            supposed 4 to 1 casualty ratio in favor of the government forces. This
                            analysis is published in Declassified Documents, 1982, 446B.</p>
                        <p>There is a more general unattributed analysis of <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName>'s views of the strategic
                            hamlet program in the Delta, dated September 17, at the Kennedy Library.
                            This document states that <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName>'s conclusions are “overly lugubrious” and
                            “should be treated with reserve!” According to the analysis, joint
                                U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> strategic planning called
                            for a holding action in the Delta until other corps were sufficiently
                                <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0304"/>secure to allow transfer of
                            forces there. In effect, the analysis maintained that the military
                            situation in the Delta was not getting markedly worse, but the battles
                            to dislodge the long-entrenched Viet Cong were yet to be fought.

                        <p>The Central Intelligence Agency prepared on September 26 a memorandum for
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, entitled “<persName corresp="#p_HD1">David Halberstam</persName>'s Reporting on South
                            Vietnam.” In this analysis the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> drew
                            the following conclusions:</p>
                        <p>“A review of all the articles written by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName> since June indicates that he is by and large
                            accurate in terms of the facts that he includes in his articles. The
                            conclusions he draws from his facts, plus the emphasis of his reporting,
                            however, tend to call his objectivity into question. Since June, the
                            great majority of <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName>'s
                            articles have dealt with the Buddhist crisis in South Vietnam and the
                            injurious effects of the crisis on the struggle with the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>“In his almost invariably pessimistic reports, <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName> makes liberal use of phrases 'some
                            Americans,' 'informed Vietnamese', or 'lower (or higher) ranking
                            Americans,' etc. Such sourcing is impossible to refute. However, other
                            observers writing from South Vietnam indicate that large segments of the
                            American military community have been and still remain optimistic about
                            the course of the war. Such optimistic sources are almost never quoted
                            by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName>.” (Ibid.,

                        <p>It may be useful to put on paper our understanding of the purpose of your
                            visit to South Vietnam. I am asking you to go because of my desire to
                            have the best possible on-the-spot appraisal of the military and
                            paramilitary effort to defeat the Viet Cong. The program developed after
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s mission and
                            carried forward under your <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0305"/>close supervision has brought heartening results, at least until
                            recently. The events in South Vietnam since May have now raised serious
                            questions both about the present prospects for success against the Viet
                            Cong and still more about the future effectiveness of this effort unless
                            there can be important political improvement in the country. It is in
                            this context that I now need your appraisal of the situation. If the
                            prognosis in your judgment is not hopeful, I would like your views on
                            what action must be taken by the South Vietnamese Government and what
                            steps our Government should take to lead the Vietnamese to the
                            action.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> has joined
                            heartily in supporting this mission and I will rely on you both for the
                            closest exchange of views. It is obvious that the overall political
                            situation and the military and paramilitary effort are closely
                            interconnected in all sorts of ways, and in executing your
                            responsibility for appraisal of the military and paramilitary problem I
                            expect that you will consult fully with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> on related political and social
                            questions. I will also expect you to examine with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> ways and means of fashioning all
                            forms of our assistance to South Vietnam so that it will support our
                            foreign policy objectives more precisely.</p>
                        <p>I am providing you separately with a letter from me to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">See <ref target="#d147">Document

                            should deliver on the occasion of a call on President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> if after discussion and reference
                            to me I conclude that such a letter is desirable.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment the question of the progress of the contest in South
                            Vietnam is of the first importance and in executing this mission you
                            should take as much time as is necessary for a thorough examination both
                            in Saigon and in the field.</p>

                            <item>Present at the meeting at 10:00 a.m. this date were: President,
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, General
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, Acting Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>
                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The President signed the draft instructions to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d143fn2">
                                <ref target="#d142">Document 142</ref>.</note> and then supplemented
                            those instructions by a number of comments.</p>
                        <p>1. He thought that it would in fact be necessary for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to see President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> twice. In these visits he should
                            press the need for reform and change as a pragmatic necessity and not as
                            a moral judgment. If the Secretary and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> reach the conclusion from their
                            own investigations that such change is essential for the winning of the
                            war, they should press this conclusion strongly.</p>
                        <p>2. The President did not think that threats to cut off aid were likely to
                            be effective. Since in fact only small changes were likely to be made in
                            the immediate future, it would be better to let such adjustments speak
                            for themselves.</p>
                        <p>3. The President thought that Diem would undoubtedly be aware of U.S.
                            connections with his opposition and that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> should simply avoid such
                            matters and concentrate upon the positive accomplishments of the last
                            decade and upon the very high level of U.S. support and cooperation
                            which has characterized the period as a whole. He also thought that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> in particular
                            could emphasize the affirmative decision of 1961 and the hopeful
                            prospects as they appeared a year ago, as against the graver situation
                            which has now developed.</p>
                        <p>4. The President thought it would be desirable for some member of
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s
                            party-perhaps General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>-to
                            press these same points with brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> separately, especially if President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> did not include his brother in
                            meetings with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. It would be important that the setting and
                            background of any such meeting should be such as to minimize the danger
                            of its use by <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> as a proof of
                            continuing American support for him.</p>
                        <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0307"/>
                        <p>5. The President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> if the members of his expedition could be
                            counted on for security vis-a-vis the press, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> assured him that he planned
                            to take most energetic measures to prevent leaks by members of his
                            mission.</p>
                        <p>6. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested, and the
                            President agreed, that a further effort be made to emphasize to the
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> government the folly of sending
                            Mme. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to the U.S. at this
                            time. (In this connection the President noted that Mme. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had now included “junior U.S.
                            officers” under her fire; he remarked that as long as she had limited
                            her criticism to the President, her opposition had not been serious but
                            that an attack on subordinates of the Pentagon was obviously
                            intolerable.)</p>
                        <p>7. The President emphasized to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> the importance of getting to the bottom of
                            differences in reporting from U.S. representatives in Vietnam. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed that this
                            was a major element in his mission and said that his own judgment was
                            more and more that the Ambassador and his associates were thinking in
                            terms of the future course of the struggle in the light of the present
                            behavior of the regime, while General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and the military were reporting on the present
                            or very recent military situation and discounting the possible impact of
                            political events on the future course of operations. (This estimate
                            coincided precisely with what the President himself had said some days
                            earlier after reading <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s
                            major cable 478 from Saigon.)<note n="3" xml:id="d143fn3">
                                <ref target="#d86">Document 86</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>8. The President was sure that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would spend a good deal of time on his troubles
                            with the press. He thought Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> should agree that the press has not always been
                            right in its accounts. (The President thought there was a great deal of
                            truth in <persName corresp="#p_AJ1">Joe Alsop</persName>'s column that
                                morning<note n="4" xml:id="d143fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJ1">Joseph Alsop</persName>'s column, “Matter
                                of Fact,” entitled “The Crusaders,” appeared in The Washington Post,
                                September 23.</note> which dealt with the zealous spirit of
                            criticism and complaint among certain newspapermen in Saigon.) But the
                            only way to deal with such press criticism was to get on with the job.
                            “The way to confound the press is to win the war.”</p>
                        <p>9. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> thought it
                            would be useful to work out a time schedule within which we expect to
                            get this job done and to say plainly to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that we were not going to be able to stay beyond
                            such and such a time with such and such forces, and that the war must be
                            won in this time period. The President did not say “yes” or “no” to this
                            proposal.</p>
                        <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0308"/>
                        <p>10. It was agreed that the President would send out to Saigon a draft
                            letter to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, and in signing
                            the memorandum of instructions he said that he believed the question of
                            delivery of the letter could be settled by the Secretary with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, without further
                            reference to him for approval.</p>

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot</persName>: I am taking advantage
                            of Mike Forrestal's safe hands to add four rather personal points.</p>
                        <p>The first is that I have the feeling that more and more of the town is
                            coming around to our view and that if you in Saigon and we in the
                            Department stick to our guns the rest will also come around. As Mike
                            will tell you, a determined group here will back you all the way.</p>
                        <p>I think you are probably right in the judgment that no pressures—even a
                            cut-off in aid—will cause <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to make the changes we
                            desire and that what we must work for is a change in government. But I
                            also think that selective aid cuts are the first step in putting starch
                            in the spaghetti—which is the second point I wanted to make.</p>
                        <p>The third point is the reasons behind this judgment. High-ranking
                            generals in a country like Viet-Nam are reluctant to set loose the
                            forces that will follow a change in government. Inevitably in such a
                            period of flux, able colonels and majors will displace at least some of
                            them and they know it. Thus, generals are not going to move until the
                            forces below them—the middle-grade officers—generate enough pressure to
                            convince the generals that they must act first. The only way to generate
                            this broad pressure from below, it seems to me, is for the U.S. to
                            maintain its posture of public disapproval and to make this disapproval
                            real and credible by cuts directed at what we disapprove. (At the same
                            time we should be preparing for a quick reorientation of the <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>'s to support the field units and
                            programs directly, bypassing the Saigon Government entirely.)</p>

                        <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>1. I am sending you this letter because of the extreme gravity of the
                            situation which now confronts our two countries in their relations with
                            each other. For us in the United States, difficult and painful decisions
                            cannot long be deferred, and I know that you on your side have problems
                            of similar gravity. Moreover, it is clear to me as I work on this matter
                            that many of its difficulties arise from problems in <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0314"/>assessing the real facts of the
                            situation. Both of our Governments, for different reasons, face great
                            difficulties on this score. And so I think it may be important and
                            helpful for you to know accurately just how the situation now appears to
                            me. In return, I shall greatly value the most candid expression of your
                            own assessment, and it may well be that you and I between us can work
                            out a new understanding in place of the present troubled, confused and
                            dangerous relationship between our Governments.</p>
                        <p>2. At the outset, let me state plainly that the central purpose of my
                            Government in all of its relations with your country is that the
                            Communists should be defeated in their brazen effort to capture your
                            country by force and fraud of all varieties. What we do and do not do,
                            whether it seems right or wrong to our friends, is always animated by
                            this central purpose. In all that it does in its relations with your
                            country, the United States Government gives absolute priority to the
                            defeat of the Communists.</p>
                        <p>3. This purpose, in a general way, has been a part of American policy
                            toward your country for many years, but as you know it took a new shape
                            and clarity at the end of 1961. At that time, in light of the very
                            unsatisfactory situation in Laos, and in view of the increasing efforts
                            then being made by the Viet Cong, I sent two of my most trusted
                            associates on a careful mission of inquiry to your country. This mission
                            of General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> was to give me the
                            best possible judgment of the course of the struggle in South Vietnam
                            and the prospect of success. Their comprehensive report convinced me,
                            first, that the situation was indeed very serious, and second, that by
                            appropriate and determined action your Government and ours together
                            could find a way to victory. Our two Governments then worked out
                            together, and you and I as their leaders formally approved, a new level
                            of effort and cooperation. And I think it is fair to say that my
                            Government has put forth its fullest efforts to achieve these goals ever
                            since.</p>
                        <p>4. By the hardest kind of joint endeavor, in which of course your people
                            have borne the heavier and the more immediate responsibility, the
                            contest against the Communists in the last year and a half has gradually
                            but steadily turned in our favor. New levels of alertness and skill were
                            developed in the forces of your country; and the essential program of
                            strategic hamlets was pressed forward with steadily increasing energy
                            and speed. Each of us, I know, pays close attention to our reports from
                            all over the country on the course of the struggle against the Viet
                            Cong, and I am sure that these reports agree on the basic proposition
                            that the war has been going well in a considerable portion of your
                            country, at least until very recently.</p>
                        <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0315"/>
                        <p>5. In the last four months, by a series of events which neither you nor I
                            can have wished and whose impact is surely a matter of equal regret to
                            us both, a new and grave set of difficulties has developed. It is not my
                            purpose here to recount in detail events with which you yourself are
                            familiar, nor even to repeat expressions of concern, which you have
                            heard many times from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, on the existing situation and dangers within your
                            country.</p>
                        <p>6. It may well be your view that American opinion has been misled on
                            these recent events, and I recognize that this is always a possibility
                            in a world in which the accurate judgment of distant happenings is
                            difficult. But that leads me to urge upon you as strongly as I can that
                            the only way to correct this difficulty is to allow more and not less
                            reporting by Americans and by other newsmen in your country. If there is
                            one principle upon which my people are united, by Constitutional
                            commitment, conviction, and tradition, it is that the way to get at the
                            truth is to let people see for themselves—regardless of the irritations
                            and criticism that a free press inevitably produces.</p>
                        <p>7. I must stress that, as I found it necessary to say publicly three
                            weeks ago, we in our Government are gravely troubled by the danger that
                            some of the methods used by some members of your Government may be
                            creating a situation in which it will not be possible to sustain public
                            support in Vietnam for the struggle against the Communists. What I must
                            make clear is the effect recent events are having upon the situation
                            here in the United States.</p>
                        <p>8. At the present time it is a fact that unless there can be important
                            changes and improvements in the relations between the Government and
                            people in your country, opinion in the United States, both in the public
                            and in the Congress, will make it impossible for me to continue without
                            change the great cooperative programs which we have been pressing
                            together since 1961. I have said publicly that we do not wish to cut off
                            our aid programs at this time, but it would be wrong for me not to let
                            you know that a change is inevitable unless the situation in Vietnam
                            takes a major visible and credible turn for the better.</p>
                        <p>9. At a minimum, and within a short period of time, it will become
                            necessary for this Government to take actions which make it clear that
                            American cooperation and American assistance will not be given to or
                            through individuals whose acts and words seem to run against the purpose
                            of genuine reconciliation and unified national effort against the
                            Communists. Otherwise, it will become impossible for us to keep on with
                            our major effort in support of your country. Unless I can show the
                            American people that the United States is wholly dissociated from the
                            public figures and public acts which have raised grave questions here, I
                            clearly cannot ask the support of the American people and the Congress

                        <p>10. There is much more that needs to be talked out between our two
                            countries on these grave matters. I am asking Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, as my personal representative,
                            to express my views to you in complete frankness and to be at your
                            disposal for further discussion. I have also instructed Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to review and to
                            report to me on the present military situation. What Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> says to you has my
                            explicit authorization and approval; I have given him complete authority
                            in all aspects of United States operations in South Vietnam, and I rely
                            upon his judgment. Of course I shall also welcome a direct expression of
                            your personal views in a message to me at any time.</p>
                        <p>11. I repeat that it remains the central purpose of the United States in
                            its friendly relations with South Vietnam to defeat the aggressive
                            designs of the Communists. But I must also repeat that this purpose can
                            only be achieved if major steps are speedily taken to remove the
                            obstacles that have so seriously and regrettably impaired our
                            cooperative effort.” <hi rend="italic">Ends</hi>.</p>

                            careful thought to your views re desirability avoiding actions on aid
                            which would hurt standard of living of masses. We believe continued
                            holding up of commercial import programs and new <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 sales will have greatest effect on monetized sector
                            of economy, limited effects on less monetized sector, and little or no
                            effects on non-monetized sector.</p>
                        <p>We would accordingly expect that effects on mass of rural people who
                            subsist largely on what they produce (except for textiles) would be
                            minimal. In cities prices almost all items consumed except domestically
                            produced foodstuffs could be expected to rise, but again we would
                            estimate that these foodstuffs (rice, nouc man and fish) represent <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0317"/>major items in budgets of mass
                            of people. We would anticipate in case of key item of rice that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would in interest its own political
                            position endeavor keep prices under control through export licensing
                            restrictions, as it has traditionally done in recent years whenever rice
                            prices threatened to rise.</p>
                        <p>If contrary to expectations aid suspension did result in sharp price
                            rises for little man perhaps effects could be offset by expanded program

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> cited recent Viet Cong

                            He added that through recent operations mounted by Col. Phnoc of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> J-2 (<hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>:
                            From other sources known to have been in progress for past few weeks)
                            evidence is mounting steadily that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            very strong, have thoroughly completed plan and have assets in place for

                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> aware that coup
                            planning by “civilians” continues. “Civilians” of course not aware of

                            of 4 Oct as Generals' deadline for <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s acceptance of Generals' recommendations.</p>
                        <p>5. Optimism stems from fact that Generals feel <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> now accepting grave danger posed

                            step desired by Generals by signing some three or four days ago an order

                            <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Smith</persName>, a professor at a leading
                            American University, speaks Vietnamese fluently, is an oriental scholar,
                            possesses wide contact among the leaders of both North and South
                            Vietnam, and in the course of his daily work has access to transcripts
                            of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> radio broadcasts and to personal
                            letters and other documents smuggled out of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>. He is just completing a visit to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, having last visited the country in
                            1960 and 1953. During this trip he did not travel extensively outside of
                            Saigon. In a long interview with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> he stated:</p>
                        <p>1. He brought with him to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> a belief
                            that we could probably manage to get along with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and it would be dangerous to make
                            a change. After several weeks here, he has changed his mind.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has aged terribly since
                            1960. He is slow mentally.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is a person with his back
                            to the wall; he has spread the fear of arrest in non-political figures
                            throughout all segments of Saigon; he is in a panic and has reached a
                            stage of desperation.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would not last 24 hours
                            without <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> who handles the
                            bribes and manipulates the power base necessary for his survival.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would not last 24 hours
                            without the cloak of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s
                            prestige. Each knows his need for the other.</p>
                        <p>5. It is impossible to liberalize the regime. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is incapable of changing.
                            Therefore we must choose between winning with the regime as it is or
                            supporting a change to another.</p>
                        <p>6. For years the public has been criticizing the regime but has done so
                            behind their hands. Now the criticism is open, by people in the streets,
                            and participated in by soldiers and policemen.</p>
                        <p>7. The treatment of the Buddhists has particularly stuck in the gullets
                            of all class of Vietnamese. They are shocked by the use of troops on
                            sacred ground. It has struck deeper than anything else the <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0320"/>regime has done and the action disgusts
                            Catholics and Buddhists alike. There is no Buddhist-Catholic clash.
                            There has been no formal Buddhist organization in the past; suddenly
                            people have been organized with press handouts, etc. There was latent
                            opposition to the regime throughout the country which crystallized
                            around the Buddhists after the Hue incident. It is clearly a political
                            and not a religious movement.</p>
                        <p>8. The first point to study carefully is: Can we win with this regime. He
                            believes we cannot. Then we must face the question of what is going to
                            replace it. Any movement away from the regime is extremely risky.
                            Neither the students nor the Buddhists can overthrow the government.
                            Only a military coup or an assassination will be effective and one or
                            the other is likely to occur soon. In such circumstances we have a 50%
                            chance of getting something better.</p>
                        <p>9. The Ambassador's policy of silence has won approval everywhere except
                            in the palace.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1">Thompson</persName> said last week the
                            strategic hamlet program has proven it will work. The <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> broadcasts have attacked nothing as
                            much as the hamlet program.</p>
                        <p>11. Through independent sources he has confirmed that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_AJ1">Alsop</persName> what <persName corresp="#p_AJ1">Alsop</persName>
                            reported <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said<note n="3" xml:id="d150fn3">See <ref target="#d151fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    151</ref>.</note> and that the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> have approached <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> through the French as <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> reported.</p>
                        <p>12. A colonel in the Army, a mutual friend of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and the professor, reports that a few days ago
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> inquired how the Army
                            would react to negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>. The colonel told <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> that he would not live 24 hours after the start of
                            such negotiations.</p>
                        <p>13. If the Communists take over control of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, not another political leader in all of Asia will place
                            any confidence in the world of the West. Indeed, the loss of confidence
                            will not be limited to Asian leaders.</p>
                        <p>14. The American government cannot do anything other than to either
                            publicly support <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> or keep
                            our mouths shut. If we follow the latter policy, a coup will probably
                            take place within four weeks. It will be a gamble as to who will take
                            over power after an interim military government.</p>
                        <p>15. Professors at the University in Saigon report life has been hell; if
                            the University is reopened the students will be out on the streets and
                            the Dean of the Literary School will be with them.</p>
                        <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is putting more and more
                            people into jail and tension is continuing to rise. As tension rises it
                            will eventually affect the morale of the troops. The elimination of the
                            curfew and martial law have been accompanied by increasing arrests in
                            the middle of the night. The jails have never been as full.</p>
                        <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0321"/>
                        <p>17. Coup plotting by the US would defeat its own end. We would end up
                            with a government tarred with the reputation of an American puppet.</p>
                        <p>18. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have not taken advantage of the
                            period of political instability because their political leadership is
                            poor and <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> facing a disastrous food
                            shortage wishes an accommodation with <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>19. It is soft-headed to believe that “democracy” will work under today's
                            conditions in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Many of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime's repressive measures
                            would be continued by a successor regime. But the people will tolerate
                            them for a time if the government will explain why they are imposed and
                            when they may be lifted. Many in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            today talk of a choice between perpetual repression under <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> or perpetual repression under
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>20. Many in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> have been puzzled by the
                            US attitude. The government has not spoken with one voice. If the US
                            government, following my return, says nothing to support the Diem
                            regime, an explosion will occur within 2, 3, or 4 weeks.</p>

                            that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, and the French may have been engaged
                            of late in exploring the possibilities of some kind of North-South
                            rapprochement. It is highly unlikely that any such explorations
                            seriously concern imminent reunification, since Hanoi's frequently
                            stated conditions for unification would entail the capitulation of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the handing over of South
                            Vietnam to the <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0322"/>Communist North.
                            We consider the chances less than even that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is now seriously interested in some form of
                            rapprochement of lesser dimensions than reunification—e.g., <hi rend="italic">de facto cease-fire, formal cease-fire, or some
                                variant of neutralization</hi>. Nevertheless, there is sufficient
                            possibility of serious Ngo family interest in such latter rapprochement
                            to merit continuing close attention. A variety of motives could induce
                            (or may have already induced) the Ngo's to explore the possibilities of
                            rapprochement with Hanoi: (a) a desire to develop their own “sanction”
                            to counter threats of US aid cuts and provide the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> some maneuverability in face of US
                            pressures; (b) a general interest in maximizing available options during
                            a crisis period (e.g., one in which they might find themselves losing
                            the military support necessary to prevent total defeat); (c) and a new
                            willingness to listen to long-standing French arguments or overtures. We
                            would expect such exploratory activity to subside if US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> relations or the course of the war
                            against the Viet Cong should improve—and, conversely, to increase if
                            either of these should further deteriorate.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The <persName corresp="#p_AJ1">Alsop</persName>
                                article.</hi> On the basis of information available to us, <persName corresp="#p_AJ1">Alsop</persName>'s facts would appear to be
                            essentially correct, but his conclusions should be examined in the
                            perspective of considerations he does not mention. A chain of events
                            somewhat similar to that which <persName corresp="#p_AJ1">Alsop</persName> recounts occurred last year: In March 1962,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> indicated in an
                            interview with Wilfred Burchett his interest in a peaceful solution to
                            the Vietnam problem. (It should be noted that the last confirmed visit
                            of Burchett to North Vietnam occurred in March 1962. Hence it is
                            possible that <persName corresp="#p_AJ1">Alsop</persName> is referring
                            to the 1962 visit, not a more recent one.)<note n="3" xml:id="d151fn3">No copy of the March 1962 interview with <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> has been found. The
                                reference to the “more recent one” is to the Burchett interview with
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> in May 1963;

                            he was prepared to extend the hand of friendship to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> (“a patriot”) and that the North
                            and South might possibly initiate several steps toward a modus vivendi,
                            including an exchange of members of divided families. There is an
                            appreciable difference, however, in the GVN response to the 1962
                            situation and its present behavior. Though rumors of some form of
                            contact between Nhu and the Viet Cong have been extant for years, the
                            existence of such contacts has heretofore been denied. Now, however,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> acknowledges contacts
                            with the North and has dropped transparent hints that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would not necessarily refuse to

                            spelled out in any detail, we believe the principal factors affecting
                            any meaningful rapprochement would be the following:</p>
                        <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0323"/>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>
                            </hi>. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is a brilliant, shrewd
                            and ambitious man, with a consummate interest in maintaining his
                            political power and all the accoutrements necessary to its exercise. He
                            has a deep antipathy toward the Hanoi regime, reinforced by the fact
                            that the Viet <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> Probably
                            tortured and killed his oldest brother. Nevertheless, it would be quite
                            in character for <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>—and
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>—to seek some measure of
                            maneuverability vis-a-vis the US to avoid being boxed between two
                            unacceptable alternatives: abject surrender to US demands or a loss of
                            all political power. It is within this context that the likelihood of
                            Ngo family dealings with North Vietnam should be assessed. We believe
                            that if <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> feel themselves soon to be faced
                            with such extreme alternatives, they might well be moved to cast about
                            for some sort of agreement with Hanoi. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would be less likely to accept an arrangement with
                            Hanoi than his brother, but circumstances are now more propitious than
                            before for <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to argue this
                            course. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s acute appreciation
                            of Communist tactics and untrustworthiness would probably set limits to
                            the nature of any agreements with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to which he would be a willing party. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would not be likely to consider
                            unification an acceptable alternative. However, if the Ngo's were moved
                            to seek a rapprochement with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> on
                            terms less drastic than reunification—e.g., a cease-fire—they might
                            seriously entertain the almost certain minimum <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> demand for the removal of US forces.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            </hi>. Although recent progress made by South Vietnam in waging the war
                            against the Viet Cong has caused Hanoi to extend its timetable, no
                            available evidence indicates that the Communists are anything but
                            confident of ultimate victory. Thus, Hanoi is not yet in a position
                            where it feels any pressure to seek a rapprochement with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on any but its own terms. So far as
                            reunification is concerned, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s
                            minimum conditions—as frequently spelled out by Ho—include the
                            termination and withdrawal of al1 US military support from South Vietnam
                            and the establishment of a national coalition government within South
                            Vietnam to include all political groups, including the Viet Cong. The
                            coalition, in turn, would negotiate with Hanoi on terms of reunification
                            for all Vietnam. These conditions would be patently unacceptable to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. However, Hanoi might be willing to
                            consider something less than reunification, particularly if it thought
                            that its aims could thereby be achieved more quickly and cheaply than by
                            continuing a campaign of armed insurgency. Hanoi's conditions for such a
                            more modest rapprochement might be considerably less stringent.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">The French</hi>. Despite present stresses in
                            Franco-US relations, it is unlikely that France would offer to replace
                            US assistance to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> (even if the
                            French felt able to make such an offer, which they probably do not). In
                            fact, France is not likely to make any aid offer sufficiently
                            substantial and concrete for <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            to feel sanguine about casting the US aside and turning toward
                            negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> under an
                            umbrella of French support. On the other hand, France would certainly
                            not discourage—and may well be actively abetting—overtures from Saigon
                            or Hanoi exploring the possibilities of a rapprochement and a
                            neutralization of South Vietnam. At least some key French officials
                            probably feel that Hanoi is almost certain to dominate the Indochinese
                            peninsula eventually since the army and political organization <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0324"/>which vanquished France is not
                            going to be defeated by the South Vietnamese, even with US assistance.
                            To persons of such persuasion, it probably appears that France's
                            long-term interests lie in seeking a posture which wins Hanoi's
                            friendship and may one day enable France to serve as Hanoi's bridge to
                            the West. One indication of the existence of such sentiments is the
                            degree of French support enjoyed by Tran Van Huu—a former French puppet
                            premier under Bao Dai who now resides in Paris and actively advocates a
                            neutralist solution for South Vietnam. French attitudes toward Vietnam
                            are colored by a desire to regain as much influence as possible in
                            Indochina, reinforced by a dislike at seeing US predominance in South
                            Vietnam and Laos. Officials holding such views are likely to receive a
                            sympathetic hearing from <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>, for there is little in such lines of argument
                            that he would not find appealing.</p>
                        <p>d. <hi rend="italic">Attitudes within South Vietnam</hi>. Even if
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> himself were inclined in
                            this direction, he would find “selling” a deal with Hanoi to key
                            elements of the Vietnamese population a delicate and difficult problem.
                            The difficulties, in fact, would appear virtually insurmountable at the
                            present time. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> could not
                            reasonably expect to effect any real rapprochement with the North
                            without signaling his intent to the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> generals-and the US intelligence community. During
                            recent weeks, <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> generals have
                            indicated that any approach to the North on <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s part would provide them with the necessary excuse
                            to “save South Vietnam” by mounting a coup. Nhu's adroitness and skill
                            in political manipulation cannot be ignored, however, and if he were
                            genuinely anxious to pursue such a tack, he might believe, rightly or
                            wrongly, that he could outmaneuver even his military opponents
                            particularly if he had some commitment of French assistance.</p>
                        <p>4. Caveat. The preceding argument is based on the assumption that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, although operating under
                            tremendous pressures, remain essentially rational. Some observers,
                            including <persName corresp="#p_AJ1">Alsop</persName>, feel that both
                            Ngo brothers may no longer be rational. Should this be the case, the
                            likelihood of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s endeavoring
                            to seek an accommodation with Hanoi must be assessed considerably higher
                            than indicated above, for Nhu's essential judgments of his own
                            capabilities, his country's interests, and the degree of the Communist
                            threat would no longer be balanced or realistic. To a somewhat less
                            extent the same would also have to be said of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-though he would be more likely to
                            withdraw totally from the world (e.g., into a monastery) and leave all
                            political decisions to his brother.</p>

                        <p>1. I propose that immediate study be made to ascertain the feasibility of
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> broadcasting a series of
                            utterances in Vietnamese to South Viet-Nam at regular intervals, said
                            utterances being well edited and well presented statements of basic
                            American ideals such as free speech, free press, habeas corpus, due
                            process, dignity of the individual, pursuit of happiness, all men
                            created equal, government is the servant of the people, etc. At present

                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>3. My belief that this might be effective is based on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s complaint to me against Armed
                            Forces Radio broadcasts here which mentioned free speech, and no arrest
                            without trial. This material came from the American Heritage series and
                            was used to fill the space which had been used by the commercial when
                            the main program had been broadcast in the U.S. <gloss target="#t_AFRS1">AFRS</gloss> was told “palace was upset”. If such things disturb
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and are regarded by him
                            as a threat to his power structure, they might give us leverage with
                            him.</p>
                        <p>4. Surely it is much better for U.S. influence to be asserted through the
                            force of our ideals rather than through our money or our power plays,
                            necessary though these sometimes are. The Viet Cong, for example, do a
                            good deal with very mediocre equipment and this is due at least in part
                            to the appeal of their ideals, although terrorism also plays a large
                            role.</p>
                        <p>5. It might just be that in the present tense time this would cause more
                            anxiety than withholding of commercial import funds is doing.</p>
                        <p>6. Would it not be a splendid thing for our world-wide reputation for us
                            to get hard things done in Viet-Nam through the power of American
                            ideas?</p>

                        <p>7. All of the above is based on my belief that <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> has large audience in Viet-Nam.</p>

                            RICHARDSON</p>
                        <p>During a long interview, lasting two hours, <persName corresp="#p_RJH1">Richardson</persName> stated (in his words and sequence of
                            thought):</p>
                        <p>1. The Buddhist crisis crystallized the discontent which had been lying
                            dormant for some time.</p>
                        <p>2. The future is so uncertain he cannot predict what will happen.</p>
                        <p>3. The massive arrests of the students has been very bad.</p>
                        <p>4. The arrests include the arrest of children of the military officers
                            and high-ranking bureaucrats.</p>
                        <p>5. The night arrests are particularly bad for they cause the people to
                            hate you.</p>
                        <p>6. R<note n="2" xml:id="d154fn2">“R” is a code name for <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Nguyen Dinh Thuan</persName>, Vietnamese
                                Secretary of State at the Presidency and Assistant Secretary of
                                State for National Defense.</note> told <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that for each cabinet member it is a personal
                            crisis.</p>
                        <p>7. What he particularly deplores is the climate of suspicion.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is still respected but
                            they can't swallow his family.</p>
                        <p>9. R particularly fears action by the highest level of the armed
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>10. Twice within the last few days R turned down proposals that he be
                            Secretary General of the Council; <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said this makes you Prime Minister but R said he
                            can't accept such a post in this Administration.</p>
                        <p>11. R has been told he is under surveillance—the family looks on him as
                            an American.</p>
                        <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0328"/>
                        <p>12. He does not see anyone with enough moral authority to replace
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> but the course
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and his family are
                            following will lead to disaster.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is devoted to his
                            country but wed to his family.</p>
                        <p>14. The relationships between the US military advisors and their
                            counterparts are good, but if the atmosphere of suspicion does not
                            evaporate, the lower levels of the Vietnamese will withdraw from that
                            relationship—“I see the process”.</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is respected; he has a
                            lot of moral qualities, but people are damaging his reputation and that
                            will ruin him. It is a tragedy.</p>
                        <p>16. “I ask you Mr. Secretary to be very firm; it is the only way. Don't
                            cut off aid; suspend the aid.”</p>
                        <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is anxious about the
                            delay in commercial aid.</p>
                        <p>18. After talking to high-ranking officials in the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> armed forces, R has nightmares. But men
                            are capable of doing very stupid things.</p>
                        <p>19. Four generals have asked to be in the cabinet. They are very
                            dangerous.</p>
                        <p>20. To save his country we must put pressure on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to force him to stop the
                            repressive measures and force <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            to leave. Otherwise a coup will occur and this will be disastrous.</p>
                        <p>21. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was the instigator of the
                            attack against the pagodas.</p>
                        <p>22. Don't believe what you see on the surface; the people are angry.</p>
                        <p>23. The episode of the students is absolutely horrible.</p>
                        <p>24. In the bottom of their hearts many officers have been fumed against
                            the government.</p>
                        <p>25. The Navy Commander who saved <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s life in 1960 can't even convince his own father
                            of the merit of the government.</p>
                        <p>26. People hate <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> and her
                            brother. If <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> tried to succeed
                            his brother, there will be war.</p>
                        <p>27. Not only have there been night arrests, but kidnappings by the
                            Surete.</p>
                        <p>28. The night arrests are terrible; mothers try to delay the taking of
                            their daughters until dawn. It is horrible—like Kadar in Hungary.</p>
                        <p>29. You asked me “How many people were arrested; how many released?” “I
                            don't know.”</p>
                        <p>30. The managing editor of Trudo, a paper suspected of being pro-American
                            has now been jailed.</p>
                        <p>31. The feeling of many of the cabinet members is that they are fed up.
                            They want to resign. But if they do, they are lost. Many cannot afford
                            to leave the country and those who don't will be put in jail. There were
                            36 secret agents in <persName corresp="#p_MAU1">Mau</persName>'s house
                            when he was going to leave.</p>
                        <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0329"/>
                        <p>32. R told <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>: you can't
                            survive without American aid. The plaster will go, then the dong—the
                            rate is already dropping.</p>
                        <p>33. <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>, the brother of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> and head of the
                            secret police, is a mad man and obsessed with sex. R is on his
                            assassination list.</p>
                        <p>34. The Minister of Economics, a devout Catholic, told R he could not
                            sleep last night thinking of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s statements which were so anti-American. He believed no
                            one could benefit other than the Communists and this led him to conclude
                            there must be a Communist behind him.</p>

                        <p>Under new election laws adopted by the National Assembly on June 13,
                            1963, and promulgated by President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> on June 16, elections for the Republic of Vietnam's
                            National Assembly were to take place on August 31. The laws called for a
                            2-week active campaign beginning on August 16 and culminating on
                            election day. The events of August 21 and the imposition of martial law
                            delayed this schedule, and elections were ultimately held on September
                            27. On October 7, the Embassy submitted to the Department in airgram 249
                            a report on the campaign and the elections. The following comprises the
                            summary portion of that report:</p>
                        <p>“Preceding election day on September 27, potential candidates had been
                            effectively limited by a variety of factors ranging from a general sense
                            of the hazards of independent politics to quite specific indications
                            that their particular candidacies were unwelcome. One candidate with a
                            reputation for independent views, Nguyen Tran, was disqualified. Thus on
                            September 27 the alternatives before the voters were limited; there was
                            no known oppositionist in the running. This fact suggested that any
                            candidate still in contention would be more or less acceptable to the
                            government, or at least not seriously opposed thereby, and this
                            consideration was probably a major factor in the government's decision
                            to proceed with the elections at this time. The advantages in so
                            proceeding depended on the government's ability (a) to produce a large
                            voter turnout, thus refuting the idea of popular discontent which might
                            manifest itself in abstentions from the polls, (b) to maintain tight
                            public security against the threat of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            disruptive activity or popular manifestations, and (c) to administer the
                            voting in a <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0330"/>manner that
                            appeared both fair and efficient, so as to enhance the government's
                            prestige both among its own people and internationally. In general, the
                            government appeared to have succeeded on these points, although some
                            doubt is cast on point (c) by the existence of charges of various
                            malpractices such as the issuance of more than one voting card to
                            'reliable' individuals and of manipulated vote-counting. If such
                            practices in fact took place, the Embassy doubts that they were designed
                            to swing elections to particular individuals (the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> did have a list of favorites, and did
                            work for them), although this may have been the incidental result. It
                            seems more likely that such practices were designed to insure the
                            appearance of a large voter turnout which was a factor of more concern
                            to the government. It is of course also possible that corruption or
                            misplaced zeal at the local level may have influenced some results.</p>
                        <p>“In general, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ability to mount
                            successfully an effort such as that represented by the election in the
                            present state of popular feeling represents impressive evidence of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s ability to control its own
                            people (not, however, of its popularity), to carry out a complex and
                            widespread organizational project, and to maintain a surprisingly high
                            degree of security against potential <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            disruptive efforts. Not to be entirely ignored either, is the long-run
                            benefit resulting from the training of both government and people in the
                            basic mechanics of electoral procedures.</p>
                        <p>“With regard to the victorious candidates for the 123 seats, these
                            included 60 incumbents (25 incumbents were beaten). 96 candidates who
                            were supported by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> (according to
                            a <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> report) won election. These
                            included 55 members of the National Revolutionary Movement (<gloss target="#t_NRM1">NRM</gloss>) and 19 women, all of whom are probably
                            members of the Women's Solidarity Movement (<gloss target="#t_WSM1">WSM</gloss>). On the other hand, based on the same <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> resort, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-supported candidates were defeated in 15 cases (the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> remaining neutral in the rest of
                            the elections). It is not clear that all these 15 defeats will be
                            allowed to stand, since some challenges to the elections held in Saigon
                            have already been registered, and it remains possible that various
                            devices might be used to overturn the results already recorded.
                            Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is likely to
                            acquiesce in most (if not all) of these defeats.</p>
                        <p>“The new legislature will have an almost even balance between new
                            deputies and incumbents, and among the new faces will be two deputies of
                            Chinese-origin, representing the first emergence of the Cholon Chinese
                            community into Vietnamese public life. Missing from the new Assembly
                            will be such relatively independent figures, who tended to be identified
                            with organized labor, as Pham Van Tung and Tran Sanh Buu. These men
                            were, interestingly enough, beaten by the two Chinese-origin deputies.
                            As has been indicated, the extent to which candidates were screened as
                            well as the large percentage of government-backed candidates who won,
                            combine to suggest that the most conspicuous characteristic of the new
                            Assembly will be its docility. Given the already established
                            powerlessness of the National Assembly as an institution, the new
                            personnel do not appear likely to cast themselves in the role of
                            innovators. Any significant evolution in the function of the Assembly
                            during the next few years will therefore probably have to depend on
                            initiatives taken outside the legislature itself.” (Department of State,

                        <p>The elections took place with only minor and isolated incidents of
                            violence notwithstanding earlier reports, mostly based on Government of
                            Vietnam sources, that the Viet Cong sought to sabotage the voting
                            procedures on a countrywide basis. As the Embassy observed elsewhere in
                            airgram A-249, the lack of violence “provided a remarkable example
                            either of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> indifference to the idea of
                            disrupting the elections or of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            ability to provide a high degree of security at least for a short time
                            over its national territory.” The Embassy also noted that the elections
                            represented a “calculated risk” to the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government in that they gave voters the option of
                            leaving their ballots blank as a sign of disapproval, and polling
                            stations provided a potential focus for popular demonstrations against
                            the government. On the other hand, the Embassy noted, the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government stood to gain in
                            domestic and international prestige if it could carry off the elections
                            successfully. While the Embassy was unprepared to accept the stated
                            92.82 percent voter participation at face value, it did believe there
                            was a massive voter turnout, in part because of subtle official pressure
                            and in part because of the holiday atmosphere which the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government attempted to associate
                            with the elections.</p>

                            possible means of exerting pressure on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> without interfering seriously with war effort were
                            prepared by <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName>. Analysis strikes me as sound and
                            I hope will be helpful in Washington consideration of problem:</p>
                        <p>1. We must recognize that the management of the aid program cannot alone
                            achieve major political changes or reversals in direction. Properly
                            timed announcements and actions on aid matters can be used to reinforce
                            and make effective other strategic moves.</p>
                        <p>2. In Viet-Nam the problem is complicated by the security situation and
                            the US strategic interest. We must face the fact that we cannot hold
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> without the Vietnamese; they can
                            hold for a considerable <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0332"/>length
                            of time without us. It is politically intolerable to postulate the
                            possibility of our assuming the position the French were in during the
                            period 1947-1954.</p>
                        <p>3. Since the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is as aware of these
                            facts as we, it is not reasonable to assume sudden success of any moves
                            we might make which rely either solely or largely on the aid
                            program.</p>
                        <p>4. Items 1 through 4 of <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 447 are
                            largely “psychological” rather than “real” in their impact. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could compensate for any of these
                            actions through diversions of materials and funds or through other
                            measures. Recognizing these limitations, we believe they can exert great
                            pressure on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> if appropriately
                            publicized in each case as symbols of US determination to disassociate
                            ourselves from the Palace Guard. Properly handled, they can undermine
                            the “political credit rating” of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> (and by inference <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>) and at the same time improve the US image in Asia
                            and elsewhere and assuage US public opinion which Washington feels
                            important at this time.</p>
                        <p>5. The careful timing of each move is important. The tactical moves
                            cannot be trotted out at any time with equal effect. Each move should
                            follow immediately on the heels of a new provocation on the part of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to show a cause and effect
                            relationship. These provocations may be directed either against the US
                            (occurring almost daily in “The Times of Viet-Nam” and in Mme. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s tirades abroad) or against the
                            Vietnamese populace.</p>
                        <p>6. The individual tactical moves must be part of a larger plan having the
                            purpose of changing the composition or the policies of the present
                            government. We assume that we are concluding that the war cannot be won
                            on a permanent basis with the present government; that covert
                            negotiation with the military will proceed concurrently with other US
                            actions to effect a change in government, and that the management of the
                            aid is designed to reinforce such other attempts to change the
                            government. If this assumption is incorrect, the moves outlined in
                            paragraphs 1-4 of <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 447 hold
                            little promise for achieving our objectives.</p>
                        <p>7. Publicity or exploitation of tactical moves in the aid program may
                            vary from use of <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>, leaking to the
                            press by the Ambassador or merely passing out to key <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials.</p>
                        <p>8. With respect to the individual suggestions:</p>
                        <p>(a) <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> written guarantees—This action
                            should only be taken on programs we are prepared and willing to
                            terminate. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would in all
                            likelihood refuse such guarantees as an affront implying past or
                            proposed “repressions” on their part. Then we would proceed to suspend
                            the aid project we had selected for such treatment and appropriate
                            publicity would put the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in the
                            position of having refused to give guarantees against repression. We
                            could select, for such treatment, items in the police program to lend
                            additional credibility to our position.</p>
                        <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0333"/>
                        <p>(b) Combat police and <gloss target="#t_DGI1">DGI</gloss>—Though the
                            discrimination between elements of the programs being used against the
                            Viet Cong and those not so engaged will be difficult given the war
                            footing of the nation as a whole, we nevertheless feel there is
                            considerable opportunity for psychological impact in this area.</p>
                        <p>(c) Hamlet militia leaders—Concur with idea that US withdraw support and
                            suggest that word be passed along to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            military that US not prepared support personal political vehicles of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>(d) <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> psywar—We suggest that [garble]
                            withhold funds for this item in their joint support budget and then tell
                            General Oai that we are doing this because of the close tie-in of his
                            activities with the personal fortunes of Counsellor <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. Hopefully this will have the
                            effect of making the psywar effort more independent of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s direction since the operation
                            itself is one we would prefer to continue to support.</p>
                        <p>9. Item 8 of <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 447 suggests the
                            accumulation of substantial plaster resources for use by the US directly
                            in the provinces. There is now on deposit in the Bank of Viet-Nam about
                            $2-3 million worth of plasters belonging to the US Government as
                            repayments on prior years Mutual Security Program loans. We could
                            gradually withdraw those funds and hold in escrow as cash for unilateral
                            operations during a short period of administrative foul-up in the wake
                            of a coup or coup attempt. We do not recommend dollar purchases,
                            especially large-scale purchases, because (1) it would frustrate our
                            cut-back on commercial imports by yielding the GVN foreign exchange for
                            expenditures anywhere, and (2) it would put us immediately under
                            suspicion of contemplating a takeover operation. If we should ever get
                            ourselves in the unfortunate position of fighting a war on the side of
                            rebellious Generals while the Ngo family still retains power in Saigon,
                            we could pump in dollars or military scrip and make that acceptable
                            currency in the regions we control.</p>
                        <p>10. Regarding questions on the commercial import program, reserves are at
                            about $150-160 million and annual earnings of foreign exchange are about
                            $60-70 million. This would provide sufficient exchange for almost 12
                            months of commercial imports at the present level of licensing
                            (excluding major investment projects and military hardware). We are
                            assuming that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would draw down
                            reserves for a period of time rather than permit serious shortages to
                            occur and prices to rise, in order to frustrate the US efforts to force
                            the government to capitulate to our demands for reform.</p>
                        <p>After some months of aid cut-offs we could expect importers and
                            government bureaucrats to become worried that reserves will be exhausted
                            and hoarding, speculation, and major price increases to set in. This
                            would be the period of major psychological impact on the government and
                            it is our estimate they would be more inclined to talk than they are
                            now.</p>

                        <p>If we were to elect to be more selective in the management of the
                            commercial import program we could renew financing the kinds of goods
                            necessary for the day-to-day well-being of the people (fertilizer, milk,
                            cotton, medicines, etc.) adding up to perhaps $40 million on an annual
                            rate and deleting from our program such things as steel, cement,

                            not directly affect people going to the market place. This approach
                            would have the advantage of permitting us to identify ourselves and our
                            program with the masses of people. It would have the disadvantage of
                            permitting the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to hold out longer
                            since their reserves would not be drawn down as rapidly. On balance, the
                            latter course appears preferable.</p>

                        <p>496. Eyes only for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. Believe it might be helpful to you to have
                            preliminary Department thinking on possible Vietnamese Government
                            structure and composition under various hypotheses. Hypotheses examined
                            consist of (a) revamped and broadened <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government with or without <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> playing some role, (b) successor
                            government headed by Tho and (c) government under preponderantly
                            military leadership. Seems clear from our studies that Viet-Nam has no
                            lack of qualified leadership or executive talent if available personnel
                            resources are put to effective use.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Principles</hi>. We believe it desirable assure
                            adequate regional representation in government under all three
                            hypotheses. Southern areas have strongly tended to feel that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government has discriminated
                            against their area in favor of persons from northern and central
                            VietNam. Southern areas are crucial to country and to winning of war and
                            should be properly represented in government.</p>
                        <p>We also believe effort should be made to establish as broad a government
                            as is feasible in an effort to unify political circles, educated class
                            and people in war against Viet Cong. However if attempted too <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0335"/>broadly result might be
                            introduction into government of disparate and incompatible personalities
                            who might hinder effective prosecution of government affairs.</p>
                        <p>We therefore think it might be useful establish, at least for duration of
                            hostilities, a Political Consultative Council to which certain leading
                            figures might be nominated in order avoid political and personality
                            clashes in executive branch. Proposals for nominations to this body
                            could be made by any member of Cabinet but should be approved by
                            majority or two-thirds vote of Cabinet.</p>
                        <p>Council's role should be clearly advisory only. Its views and
                            recommendations should be considered by Cabinet but decisions should
                            rest with Cabinet. But to give this organ sufficient substance to make
                            membership attractive, it should be consulted by government on all major
                            issues.</p>
                        <p>Such body would appear particularly desirable in view supine status
                            National Assembly which will not be improved by current elections. We
                            also believe this device could be useful in giving Viet-Nam's educated
                            elite an institutional channel for political expression which they have
                            been denied to date by Ngo family.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Personalities</hi>. Effective broadening of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government would have to be based
                            on assumption (which we realize is questionable) that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> (and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> if he remained on scene) would be willing change
                            approach to politics and method of governing to permit real sharing of
                            authority. Otherwise we recognize that either new figures would not
                            participate or changes in Cabinet would represent only facade changes as
                            they have been in past.</p>
                        <p>In revamped <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government we
                            would propose Vice President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>
                            be given considerable coordinating authority over Cabinet in fact
                            (perhaps in new post of Prime Minister) and not just in name as he now
                            has. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> could be retained as
                            SecState for Presidency, but relieved of his Assistant Defense portfolio
                            as these two positions are too burdensome for one man however able to
                            carry. We suggest team of General Big <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> as SecState for National Defense and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> as Deputy who could
                            conduct Magsaysay-type operation in Viet-Nam through coordination of
                            military and strategic hamlet programs. General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> (next ranking general after
                                <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>) could become Chief
                            Joint General Staff. Interior might also be headed by General (<persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> or Chieu) who would work closely with <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Other Cabinet posts could be filled from following list of able
                            personalities: [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 1ine not

                        <p>Under second hypothesis of successor government headed by <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>, government could be largely same
                            as that outlined above for revamped <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government. However, seems unlikely that <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> would want to retain <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> in government since <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> during days when he was
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> favorite made little
                            secret of his low regard for <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Under third hypothesis preponderantly military government would likely
                            consist of generals named above, with Big <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> as head because of popularity within armed forces
                            and acceptability to other generals. Generals could be expected occupy
                            certain key posts in government, but other ministries could probably be
                            filled from above civilian list.</p>
                        <p>Political Consultative Council under any of three hypotheses could
                            include well-known political oppositionists like Pham Huy Quat, Phan
                            Quang Dan, Pham Khac Suu, Nguyen Ton Hoan, [<hi rend="italic">less than

                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] as
                            leading Buddhist and Catholic figures, respectively, could be named to
                            Council. Lt. Col. Pham Ngoc Thao might also be nominated to Council
                            since his inclusion in government would probably not be acceptable to
                            generals. Professional people [<hi rend="italic">1 line not

                            representatives like [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                        <p>During the first two hours of the meeting, President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> held forth on the course of the
                            war, the key role played by the strategic hamlets program, and on the
                            wisdom of the various major decisions of his government. During the
                            third hour, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            explained, briefly but deliberately and with considerable force, the
                            concern of the U.S. Government at the recent political unrest in
                            Viet-Nam. He noted that this unrest and the repression that had brought
                            it on could endanger the war effort and the American support for that
                            effort. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            brought up the unfortunate public declarations of <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Mme. Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>After <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had made the
                            inevitable rebuttals and explanations, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> stressed the vital importance
                            of responding to the very legitimate anxiety felt in the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> cannot have missed the point that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s remarks
                            were a carefully thought-out and deliberately expressed statement of
                            U.S. disapproval and concern, and that this disapproval and concern was
                            felt just as strongly by the Department of Defense as by the Department
                            of State.</p>

                            maps in a rambling discussion of the war and the wisdom of various
                            policies and courses of action adopted by his government. During this
                            virtual monologue, he made the following principal points, all of which
                            he had touched on in greater or lesser detail at earlier meetings with
                            the Ambassador:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Strategic Hamlets</p>
                        <p>The war was going well, thanks in large measure to the strategic hamlets
                            program. Due to that program, the Viet Cong enemy was having increasing
                            difficulties in finding food and recruits, and was being steadily forced
                            into increasingly difficult and unrewarding tactical situations.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said that American
                            deliveries under Public Law 480, particularly in the category of feed
                            grains, had been most helpful to the success of the strategic hamlet
                            program. (He made no other direct acknowledgment of American aid.) He
                            said that the British had given the Vietnamese government valuable
                            advice at the outset of the <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0338"/>program, based on British experience in Malaya. He said that for a
                            variety of local reasons, his government had not followed the British
                            advice in all instances.</p>
                        <p>He recalled that the British had advised him to consolidate and hold
                            firmly one area before extending the strategic hamlets program to
                            another. They had also advised him to hold the arterial coastal highway
                            and consolidate the area between it and the seacoast before trying to
                            secure areas further inland. He noted that the British had said that the
                            strategic hamlets program should be limited at first to the most
                            populous and most productive areas of the country. He remarked in this
                            connection that he had made important departures from the British plan,
                            but always for good and valid reasons.</p>
                        <p>Outlining his thoughts on maps, he explained that if he had disregarded,
                            even for a short time, the under-populated and comparatively
                            unproductive highlands, these areas would have become a base for Viet
                            Cong attacks and for a Viet Cong drive to the sea to cut the highway and
                            split the Republic.</p>
                        <p>He acknowledged that his strategic hamlets program was overextended and
                            that in some areas the Viet Cong could attack and overwhelm poorly
                            garrisoned strategic hamlets. He said that he realized some strategic
                            hamlets were set up before the defense personnel were properly trained
                            or armed, but that on balance both the risks and the losses were
                            acceptable. For example, he said, he could push ahead rapidly with the
                            establishment of ten substandard strategic hamlets. The Viet Cong could
                            attack these and overwhelm, say, two of them. But if two fell, eight
                            others would survive and grow stronger, and the area in which the Viet
                            Cong could operate with impunity would shrink faster than otherwise
                            would have been the case.</p>
                        <p>Another reason he gave for making departures from the British plan was
                            that by so doing he could put isolated strategic hamlets into key
                            crossroads and junction points, and force on the Viet Cong considerable
                            detours in their supply routes. Further to the question of departures
                            from the British operational plan, he said he had taken the calculated
                            risk of opening highways to traffic before the areas through which they
                            passed were absolutely secure. He said that, on the whole, he was
                            satisfied with this gamble, and that thanks to his willingness to make
                            departures from the plan and accept risks, the war effort was further
                            along.</p>
                        <p>The strategic hamlets, then, affected all aspects of the war: the
                            military, sociological, economic, and political. When Viet Cong cadres
                            who had escaped to the north a few years ago returned to the south, they
                            were amazed at the economic and sociological progress that had been
                            made. This impression of real progress in South Viet-Nam increased their
                            propensity to defect (see below under Defections). Thanks to the
                            strategic hamlets program there is a growing grass-roots democracy. <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0339"/>While the country's
                            institutions are not yet perfect, they have been strengthened by the
                            strategic hamlets program; in two or three more years Viet-Nam will be a
                            model democracy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cadres</p>
                        <p>The matter of cadres was the key to the solution of all the country's
                            problems. It must be remembered that Viet-Nam is an underdeveloped
                            country that is still suffering from a serious lack of trained
                            personnel. At the time of Independence, there were, say, five judges in
                            the whole country. There should be at least one per province. Much has
                            been accomplished. At present about half of the provinces have one
                            judge, and of the other half, sometimes two or even three, share, one
                            judge. It is hard to apply to the letter the right of habeas corpus and
                            other refinements of a legal system inherited from the French in these
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>But progress is being made. Cadres are brought in from the provinces to a
                            training camp fifteen kilometers outside of Saigon. They are taught to
                            draw on locally available resources, and experience gained in one area
                            is passed on to cadres from another area. On Fridays there are political
                            discussions. Members of parliament and high officials visit the camps
                            and stimulate discussion groups. When the training cycle is completed,
                            the cadres return to their strategic hamlets and set up comparable
                            discussion groups there. Democracy and its institutions are
                            strengthened. (Later on in the meeting, Diem returned to the subject of
                            lack of cadres when attempting to explain away the recent political
                            unrest and Buddhist and student demonstrations.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Creation of New Provinces</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> traced out on the map the
                            new provinces he had created or intended to create. He seemed to see in
                            the creation of new provinces a way of bringing a greater effort to bear
                            on solving the problems of an area.</p>
                        <p>For example, he is creating a new province west of Saigon to sit astride
                            the Viet Cong communications route running from Tay-Ninh Province
                            southeasterly to the Delta. This will impede access from the Viet Cong
                            stronghold on the Cambodian border northwest of Saigon to the Delta.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> claimed that the Viet
                            Cong commander for that stronghold lived in air-conditioned comfort in
                            Phnom Penh and frequently drove to the Vietnamese border from the
                            Cambodian capital in an American automobile</p>
                        <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0340"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Elections</p>
                        <p>He noted that the elections held a few days before had been a great
                            success. Many more people voted than ever before, thanks in part to the
                            fact that there were about 50% more ballot boxes than at the last
                            elections. Communist efforts to disrupt the voting had been a failure,
                            partly as a result of several successful security operations in which
                            “all three security services” participated.</p>
                        <p>Again, the vast extension of the strategic hamlets program made it easier
                            and safer for people to vote than in past years, and he was touched at
                            the interest of even the simplest peasants in exercising their suffrage
                            and participating in the democratic process. In spite of the improved
                            security situation, at least two people were killed by the Viet Cong
                            because they voted, and he felt this loss deeply and personally. The
                            discussion groups in the strategic hamlets had further increased the
                            people's interest in government and voting. (<hi rend="italic">Ambassador's comment</hi>: This contrasts with well-founded
                            observation that truckloads of soldiers were carted around in trucks so
                            that they could vote several times in one day.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Crop Destruction and Defoliation</p>
                        <p>In response to his rhetorical question, he said that the crop destruction
                            and defoliation programs were useful and were necessary for a speedy
                            conclusion of the war. He noted that the British experience in Malaya
                            left no doubt as to their importance. “If you want to add years to the
                            length of this war,” he said, “simply cut off these programs.” He
                            explained that in some parts of the country, the Viet Cong were using
                            half of their troops to grow food, and that except for the Delta area,
                            where food is so plentiful that controls are almost impossible, the Viet
                            Cong was very hard pressed for food, all the more so because it was
                            increasingly difficult for them to get into villages or to force farmers
                            to give them food.</p>
                        <p>He said flatly that regardless of whatever confusion might reign on the
                            subject in Washington, crop destruction and defoliation were not
                            humanitarian questions but were simple tools of victory. His field
                            commanders, he said, felt particularly strongly about this. Some had
                            complained that they had food patch targets in mind which, if they could
                            not be attacked by the end of October, would produce a crop that would
                            sustain the enemy for months.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Larger Viet Cong Units</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> noted that while the total
                            number of Viet Cong had declined in the past year, the number of
                            relatively large units—companies and battalions—engaged had risen. He
                            explained that this was because of the success of the strategic hamlets
                            program. In the past, <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0341"/>the Viet
                            Cong could get what they wanted from a village—food and recruits—with a
                            mere handful of men. Now they were increasingly forced to mount a
                            company-scale attack to get into the village. Furthermore, since the
                            whole rural environment had become much more actively hostile to the
                            Viet Cong, they were forced to group up in larger units to survive.
                            These larger units, of course, offered better targets to the
                            government's forces. The fact that there was a greater use of large
                            units by the Viet Cong was one more indication of how well the war was
                            going for the government. It was one more indication that the Viet Cong
                            found themselves more and more in the position of being like a foreign
                            expeditionary corps, rather than as a force that could exist and move in
                            the population like a fish in the sea.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Public Works and Opening Roads</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> attached great importance
                            to his public works program and the strategic concepts served by it. He
                            showed on the maps where he had put through roads and canals, or had
                            improved existing ones, and noted the many economic, social, political
                            and military advantages that resulted from this effort. He remarked that
                            in many parts of the country food deliveries by road were almost normal,
                            as in pre-war times. This development relieved the navy of the job of
                            convoying sea-borne supplies, and left it free to pursue the enemy more
                            aggressively.</p>
                        <p>As if to answer the constant American representations in favor of a more
                            mobile and aggressive employment of his forces, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> remarked that it was sometimes
                            necessary to commit troops to static defenses, as around key public
                            utilities, factories, and bridges. Other forces had to be committed more
                            or less statically to reinforce strategic hamlets that were in
                            particularly exposed areas or had not yet generated their own trained
                            defensive forces.</p>
                        <p>During a discussion of public works and their influence on the economic
                            well-being of various provinces, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> turned the conversation to the Seventh Division
                            area southwest of Saigon, remarked that Kien Phong Province was very
                            well run and that the province chief, Lt. Col. Dinh Van Phat, was very
                            able indeed. President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            acknowledged this. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> went on to make the point that the situation in
                            the adjoining province, Kien Tuong, was bad, and that the province
                            chief, Major Le Thanh Nhut, was not doing his job and should be
                            replaced. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> objected to this,
                            and tried to explain away in terms of the local economic geography, the
                            difficulties of the lagging province. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> made it clear that with all
                            due respect to the President's explanation, he continued to have his
                            doubts about the leader of the lagging province.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> ended his optimistic
                            monologue by saying that there had been a significant increase in the
                            rate of defections from the Viet Cong. As noted earlier, many cadres who
                            had left the south a few years ago were impressed with the social
                            progress and improved standard of living in the south and contrasted
                            these with the depressed condition in the north. This was especially
                            true of those who had some education and could make comparisons. So many
                            Viet Cong were trying to defect that senior unit commanders and
                            hard-core Communists were being forced to take this new desire to defect
                            into account in planning operations. Commanders had become loathe to
                            send their men out individually or in small groups. This was another of
                            the forces that compelled the Viet Cong to establish larger units.</p>
                        <p>Knowing that their commanders would be unlikely to trust them on an
                            individual or small-scale mission that would give them an opportunity
                            ably to defect, many individual Viet Cong would try to distinguish
                            themselves in a number of encounters so that they would be entrusted
                            with a mission which would offer them an opportunity to surrender. The
                            earlier land reform program of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s government, which had won the government so much
                            popular support, was generally known to the Viet Cong, and awareness of
                            this land reform was often a factor in an individual's decision to come
                            over to the government side. (Ambassador's comment: See Vice President

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> concluded his optimistic
                            presentation by noting that although the war was going well, much
                            remained to be done in the Delta area, which presented many special
                            problems. The battle-hardened 9th Division was recently transferred to
                            that area from the north, and it would soon make its presence felt. He
                            noted that it was hard to wage war in an area that consisted mainly
                            either of muddy rice paddies or of the thick and almost impenetrable
                            foliage of coconut plantations. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> remarked at this point that the war in coconut
                            plantations would be greatly facilitated if <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would lift his prohibition on the use of 500-pound
                            bombs (forbidden after the disturbingly accurate bombing of the palace
                            by rebels in the Vietnamese air force in February, 1962). <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> seemed to be in some doubt as to
                            whether the General had made his statement in earnest or was simply
                            “needling” him. He replied half-jokingly that if there should be a real
                            need for the use of 500-pound bombs and if the war could be won that
                            way, he <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0343"/>would give the
                            necessary clearance. (Although the conversation was in French, he used
                            the English word “clearance”, and on other occasions used a number of
                            other American military expressions.)</p>
                        <p rend="center">THE AMERICAN REPRESENTATIONS</p>
                        <p>When a suitable pause occurred in the monologue, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> began his statement. He said
                            that he was in Viet-Nam because it was the sincere desire of the United
                            States to help Viet-Nam win the war against the Viet Cong. He emphasized
                            that this was basically a Vietnamese war and that all the United States
                            could do was to help. The Secretary noted that while the progress of the
                            war was reasonably satisfactory, he was concerned over a number of
                            things. There was the political unrest in Saigon, and the evident
                            inability of the government to provide itself with a broad political
                            base. There was the disturbing probability that the war effort would be
                            damaged by the government's political deficiencies and the attendant
                            loss of popularity. The recent wave of repressions had alarmed public
                            opinion both in Viet-Nam and in the United States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> ascribed all this to
                            inexperience and demagoguery within Viet-Nam and to misunderstanding in
                            the United States of the real position in Viet-Nam because of the
                            vicious attacks of the American press on his government, his family and
                            himself. He said nothing to indicate that he accepted the thesis that
                            there was a real problem, and his whole manner was one of rejecting
                            outright the Secretary's representations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary resumed by saying that he knew what it was to be attacked
                            by the press, but that, regardless of what one thought of the accuracy
                            of the press—and he was willing to acknowledge that some press accounts
                            may have been in error—there was no escaping the fact that there was a
                            serious political crisis, a crisis of confidence in the government of
                            Viet-Nam both in Viet-Nam and in the United States. This was
                            demonstrated by such tangible evidence as the resignation of the Foreign
                            Minister, the recall or resignation of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Tran Van Chuong</persName> at Washington, and the
                            fact that Saigon University was closed. The Secretary warned <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that public opinion in the United
                            States seriously questioned the wisdom or necessity of the United States
                            Government's aiding a government that was so unpopular at home and that
                            seemed increasingly unlikely to forge the kind of national unity or
                            purpose that could bring the war to an early and victorious
                            conclusion.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> rebutted these
                            points in some detail and displayed no interest in seeking solutions or
                            mending his ways. He said the departure from office of Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Vu Van Mau</persName> was dictated by
                            personal and not political considerations. His wife's family seemed to
                            be foredoomed to violent deaths. One of them had died in an airplane <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0344"/>accident. Others had met other
                            violent deaths. Mau's wife thought that there must be some kind of a
                            curse on the family and urged her husband to make a vow to make a
                            pilgrimage to lift the curse. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> remarked that during his tenure as Foreign
                            Minister, <persName corresp="#p_MAU1">Mau</persName> was often out of
                            the office. When <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> asked
                            where he was, he learned he was at his home, urging his mother to take
                            nourishment or his wife to look after her health. The wife had had one
                            serious operation after another—<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> implied it was lung cancer, but did not
                            specifically so state.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the relief of <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Tran Van
                                Chuong</persName> as Ambassador at Washington, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> stated that the Cabinet had voted
                            unanimously to relieve him. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Vu Van Mau</persName>, who was present, had voted in favor of
                            relieving him, too.</p>
                        <p>As for the university and the student unrest in general, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> explained that the student body
                            and even the faculty were most immature, untrained and irresponsible. He
                            repeated that Viet-Nam was an underdeveloped country, with almost no
                            suitable staff for its universities. He said the dean of the Science
                            Faculty at the University of Saigon was only 32 years old. He said the
                            students who demonstrated against the government had been misled by
                            troublemakers both in the student body and in the faculty. The
                            government had no choice but to arrest the students. Shortly afterwards
                            (after this benevolent attention of a benevolent government, he implied)
                            the students recognized the error of their ways, and felt duped and
                            cheated by those who had misled them. They cursed their former leaders,
                            and sang the praises of the government; many of them were now
                            pro-government in their attitudes. He said that few of the high school
                            teachers were qualified for their jobs, and students and teachers alike
                            were inexperienced politically. Again, by serene tone and manner he
                            indicated that he had satisfactorily explained away whatever
                            misunderstanding it was that might have been bothering his guests.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that no small part of the Vietnamese government's
                            difficulties with public opinion in the United States came from the
                            ill-advised and unfortunate declarations of <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>. The Secretary took from his pocket a
                            newspaper clipping and said that as he boarded his aircraft in
                            Washington he had been greeted by the following. He read a report of
                            Mme. Nhu's statement to the effect that American junior officers in
                            Viet-Nam were behaving like little soldiers of fortune, etc.<note n="3" xml:id="d158fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> is reported to have
                                stated in late September 1963 that younger American officers in
                                Vietnam “are acting like little soldiers of fortune. They do not
                                know what is going on. With their irresponsible behavior, they have
                                forced senior officers into following a confused policy.” (As quoted
                                in Sobel (ed.), South Vietnam, 1961-65, p. 75)</note>

                        <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0345"/>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized, and the Ambassador confirmed his remarks, that
                            such outbursts were most offensive to American public opinion. The
                            Secretary said that the American people would flatly refuse to send out
                            the best of their young officers to face mortal perils to support an
                            effort that had such irresponsible spokesmen. One of the Americans
                            present asked flatly if there were not something the government could do
                            to shut her up. At this point <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> seemed to be just a bit weary and a bit on the
                            defensive. His glances and manner suggested that perhaps for the first
                            time in the whole conversation, he at least saw what his guests were
                            talking about, especially when the Ambassador remarked that Mme. Chiang
                            Kai-shek had played a decisive part in losing China to the
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>But nevertheless he rose to the defense routinely and with his standard
                            and well-known arguments. Mme. Nhu was a member of parliament. She had a
                            right to speak her mind, both as a member of parliament and as a member
                            of a free society. Furthermore, one cannot deny a lady the right to
                            defend herself when she has been unjustly attacked. Mme. Nhu had been
                            under a merciless and scurrilous press attack for many months, and if
                            she became exasperated, that had to be understood. Finally, he asked if
                            the Secretary had read Mme. Nhu's denial.<note n="4" xml:id="d158fn4">Not further identified.</note> Again, very sure of himself,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> indicated that a
                            careful reading of the denial, or more accurately the explanatory
                            statement, would clarify the matter and allay his interlocutor's
                            anxieties.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary indicated that this was not satisfactory and that the
                            problems of which he spoke were real and serious and would have to be
                            solved before the war could be won or before Viet-Nam could be sure of
                            the continued American support that he sincerely hoped it would merit
                            and receive.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Buddhist Controversy</p>
                        <p>While on the subject of the inaccuracies and injustices of the press
                            treatment of his government, President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> held forth at considerable length on the Buddhist
                            controversy. He acknowledged that he bore a certain responsibility in
                            all this: He had been too kind to the Buddhists. He had given them so
                            much assistance that the number of Buddhist temples in the country had
                            doubled during his administration.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> spoke for some twenty
                            minutes on the Buddhist problem, but said almost nothing that had not
                            figured in the controlled-press handling of the matter. He repeated the
                            allegations of orgies in pagodas, and emphasized that the heart of the
                            problem was the fact that “anyone could become a bonze (priest) who
                            shaved his head and acquired a yellow robe.” He said that one of the
                            three bonzes who <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0346"/>took refuge in
                            the American Embassy had been a policeman until he was expelled from the
                            force two years ago for unsuitability and poor performance. He had
                            become a vagabond until some two or three months ago, when he proclaimed
                            himself a bonze and took refuge in the Embassy. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said the Buddhists were very
                            publicity-conscious, and even had a man dress in European clothes in
                            order better to get through a police cordon in front of <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>. This man then put on his robe, which
                            he had carried concealed, and took off his wig and broke out various
                            anti-regime streamers and slogans.</p>
                        <p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> added darkly
                            that “some American services in Saigon” were engaged an anti-regime
                            plotting and that he was “preparing a dossier” and might return to the
                            subject in due course. He offered no further explanation, and none was
                            sought; he passed on quickly to continue his tirade against the
                            Buddhists.</p>
                        <p>He said that most of the Buddhist sects in Viet-Nam support the
                            government's position and deplore the attitude of the irresponsible
                            extremist minority that is making all the trouble. He said that part of
                            the Buddhists' trouble lay in too rapid growth and lack of organization.
                            For example, he said, no records are kept on who is or is not a bonze,
                            and there are no universally accepted standards for ordainment. He
                            proposed to help the Buddhists by assisting them in setting up a
                            national register of all bonzes. Work on this project had already
                            started, and would be pushed vigorously.</p>
                        <p>At about this point one of the Americans noted that things were in such
                            bad shape that the United Nations were considering sending a delegation
                            to study the problem of repression of the Buddhists. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said very quickly, “Well let them
                            come and see for themselves, we will let them see what the real
                            situation is.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> warned that the Viet Cong
                            were quick to take advantage of the disorders caused by the Buddhists.
                            He said that at the time of raids on the pagodas and the proclamation of
                            martial law—August 21, 1963—the Viet Cong brought four field radio sets
                            into the outskirts of Saigon—much closer then they had dared come
                            before. They felt that if the disturbances were to increase, they could
                            do this with impunity. By August 25, they saw that the disturbances were
                            not spreading and pulled their radios back to where they had been
                            before. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> also said that the
                            Buddhist organization based in Ceylon was Communist-dominated, and that
                            he had learned from an unimpeachable German source that one Buddhist
                            priest traveling to Viet-Nam from abroad was a Communist. For all these
                            reasons, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said, the
                            Vietnamese armed forces and police had made a united front in imploring
                            him to proclaim martial law and allow them to suppress the disorders
                            which a few Buddhist extremists were creating.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> recapitulated the
                            points made by the Ambassador and the Secretary, and reminded President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that regardless of the
                            explanations he offered for the disorders, a serious crisis of
                            confidence was developing in the United States and it was vital for the
                            government of Viet-Nam to respond to this legitimate anxiety.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary closed by repeating once again that he had made his
                            representations as a friend who sincerely wished to help the Vietnamese
                            in their war effort. There was no note of strain or unfriendliness on
                            either side. The Secretary and the Ambassador noted that they were
                            expected back at the Palace in two hours for dinner, and expressed their
                            pleasure at this prospect.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the meetings Secretary <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said nothing.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> made very clear to President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> the United States Government's
                            disapproval of the situation in Viet-Nam. It must have been clear to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that there was no rift
                            between the Departments of State and of Defense. The Ambassador observed
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> appeared much younger
                            and brighter than at the last two meetings at which he had seen him.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> offered absolutely no
                            assurances that he would take any steps in response to the
                            representations made to him by his American visitors. In fact, he said
                            nothing to indicate or acknowledge that he had received even friendly
                            advice. His manner was one of at least outward serenity and of a man who
                            had patiently explained a great deal and who hoped he had thus corrected
                            a number of misapprehensions.</p>

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, and I had conversation with
                            Vice President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>. He opened up
                            conversation immediately by recalling that two years ago he had said to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> that the American
                            effort in Viet-Nam should have three characteristics: It should be
                            rapid; it should be efficient; it should be intelligent. We had
                            succeeded in the first two parts but had failed in the third: we are not
                            using our strength intelligently.</p>
                        <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0348"/>
                        <p>2. When asked to elaborate on this. He said that it was obvious that
                            police state methods were being used and that this was creating deep
                            discontent and yet we were unable to do anything about it. He felt sorry
                            to speak so frankly, but the situation was very serious.</p>
                        <p>3. When asked to say what we should do to be intelligent and to make our
                            influence effective, he said that he did not feel free to tell us. It
                            was his duty not to set himself apart from the President, that he had
                            already gone very far in saying what he had.</p>
                        <p>4. We pressed him hard on different methods which had been proposed. He
                            agreed that protestations and words by Ambassadors and others were
                            totally ineffective. He said that withholding economic aid would do
                            nothing since we had inflation already; introduction of US troops would
                            be “idiotic” as would be an attempt by the US to organize a coup
                            d'etat.</p>
                        <p>5. When we asked him if there were any Vietnamese or foreigners in Saigon
                            whose advice we should seek, he said that the best people were out of
                            the country but that they could not advise us on details. When asked to
                            suggest persons out of the country, he suggested Vu Van Maul</p>
                        <p>6. When asked whether it was true that all the dissatisfaction was in the
                            cities and that there was none in the villages, he said that this was
                            not true, that he had spent his life in the villages of the southern
                            part of country and knew them intimately. There was serious discontent
                            in the villages, but not because of the police state methods being used
                            in the cities. The villager is discontented for several reasons: first,
                            he feels he has to pay too much money to the local village agent who is
                            demanding much more than the 100 plasters and ten days of work which the
                            villager had agreed to do. Then, said <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>, when the villager leaves his hamlet in the morning
                            to go out to work in the field, he meets the Viet Cong who forces him to
                            pay another set of taxes.</p>
                        <p>7. When General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> remarked
                            that this should not happen in a well fortified hamlet, <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> said that it did not happen in the
                            hamlet-it happened when the villager steps out of the hamlet and goes
                            into the field.</p>
                        <p>8. When General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said that
                            in a properly defended hamlet this should not happen, Tho said: Why,
                            General Taylor, there are not more than 20 to 30 properly defended
                            hamlets in the whole country.</p>
                        <p>9. With some warmth he said: Why do you gentlemen think that the Viet
                            Cong is still so popular? Two years ago there were between 20-30,000 in
                            the Viet Cong army; for these last two years we have been killing a
                            thousand a month; and yet the Viet Cong is even larger today. Why is
                            this true?</p>
                        <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0349"/>
                        <p>10. When General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and I
                            suggested it might be intimidation, <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> said: Intimidation can make them join, but it cannot
                            stop them from running away. While some of them do run away, there are
                            many who stay. Why is this? </p>
                        <p>11. When I suggested that it might be the promises that the Viet Cong
                            make, Tho said: They cannot promise a thing-neither food nor shelter nor
                            security. The answer is that they stay in the Viet Cong army because
                            they want to, and the reason they want to is their extreme discontent
                            with the Government of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Vice President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> evidently wants us to straighten
                            out the whole situation here and yet does not hesitate to disapprove of
                            any methods of doing so. But his analysis of village attitudes is worthy
                            of consideration.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Point 2</hi>. What one sees in South Vietnam is
                            scenery but underneath the apparent calm of the surface is a “turning of
                            the screw” which is increasing with control of the government over the
                            people. The machinery to dominate the people is as perfect as that
                            employed by the Communists. The government has established a police
                            State although the family has successfully disguised this fact. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] will send us a

                            <hi rend="italic">Point 3</hi>. At first, people who had been tortured
                            were afraid to speak out but now they are willing to do so. “Absolutely
                            people have been tortured.” He “is so harassed and bothered by the

                            from the Church and the US. Therefore, they are forced to other
                            solutions: some are going and will continue to go to the Viet Cong but
                            more are turning to neutralists. With neutralism they believe “we will
                            have no more war and at least a hope to topple the regime”. They “prefer

                            of many of the people). What they believe is that if the family stays

                            is quiet because the Mafia has given the order to make it so. But if the
                            policy of the Mafia changes the calm disappears and unrest erupts. In
                            South Vietnam, there are districts which we believe to be quiet but this
                            is so only because the Viet Cong have an interest to make it appear so.

                            with the Communists because he believes he could then become boss of all

                            overthrow it. The people believe the Americans think that (the

                        <p>I talked at length with the French Charge, the Canadian <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> Commissioner, and the Indian <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> Commissioner on the subject of
                            relations between North and South Vietnam. All of them were inclined to
                            doubt that there was much substance in current rumors about a <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>-Ho deal. However, all of them
                            insisted that we should not discount the possibility of such a deal in
                            the future. (The French Charge said “three or four months.”)</p>
                        <p>Their reasoning was similar. All of them felt the North was hurting very
                            badly economically and was aware that the Viet Cong was losing the
                            battle in the South. They therefore concluded that, in return <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0352"/>for two stipulations, the North
                            would be willing to negotiate a cease fire agreement with the South.
                            These two stipulations are: North-South trade and the departure of U.S.
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>An additional factor which [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] felt might impel the North to such a deal was
                            Chinese pressure. If U.S. forces could be removed from Vietnam, the
                            Chinese might ease somewhat their pressure on Hanoi and grant them a
                            greater measure of autonomy.</p>
                        <p>All three felt Brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> might
                            be willing to make such a deal for two reasons. First, his supreme
                            confidence in being able to “beat the Communists at their own game”; and
                            second, his desire to be rid of the Americans. The French Charge
                            admitted that Ambassador Lalouette had talked with Nhu in these terms.
                            Both <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Lalouette</persName> had concluded that the
                            progress of the war, prior to recent events, was such that a deal could
                            probably safely be negotiated by the end of this year. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s subsequent disclosure of these

                                    refused to be drawn out by what <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> later described as “broad hints of our

                                    misunderstanding as follows:</p>

                                    was confused yesterday as to what was taking place. He gave
                                    Jones no impression of having sent word to see you and me. As
                                    far as he was concerned, the occasion was simply a game of
                                    tennis. He indicated that he has no message to communicate to me
                                    now but would be very glad to discuss the military situation at
                                    any time. He sees no problem in my calling on him or in his

                            deeply concerned over the country. He considers that many difficulties
                            remain in the military program. There hasn't been enough understanding
                            between the population and the armed forces in the field. There is still
                            no unimpeded channel of military command from Saigon to the field. There
                            is divided responsibility between the military commanders and the
                            provincial officials. All of these circumstances make ultimate success
                            doubtful to General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>.</p>
                        <p>b. With regard to the Buddhist difficulties, General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> considers that the matter is
                            basically a struggle for special privileges between Buddhists and
                            Catholics. Many provincial officials are favoring the Catholics in
                            granting the many forms of government permits controlling commercial
                            transactions, travel, and the like. There has been no obstacle to the
                            practice of the Buddhist religion but individuals have been jailed for
                            contributing money to the Pagodas. General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> feels that this Buddhist issue has not yet cropped
                            up in the Armed Forces but he is always afraid that it may at any
                            time.</p>
                        <p>c. The student riots reflect the resentment of parents for the many forms
                            of injustice perpetrated by the central government. There has been some
                            Communist inspiration behind the demonstrations but the basic cause is
                            this sense of injustice which permeates most of the urban society.</p>
                        <p>d. General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> has no solution
                            for the unhappy conditions which he perceives. He understands the
                            difficulty of the United States in manipulating the aid program to
                            influence the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government.
                            It would be tragic, he feels, to retard the military campaign by a cut
                            back in aid. He sees no opposition to the present government which might
                            rally domestic and foreign support.</p>
                        <p>e. I told General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> that he
                            could always communicate with me on any subject through General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. In summary, General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> sees
                            his country in chains with no way to shake them off.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President: This letter responds to our conversation after your

                                    <hi rend="italic">Swords and Plowshares</hi>, p. 298.</note> in
                            which you kindly expressed an interest in receiving my professional
                            comments on the military situation as I observed it during visits in the
                            past week to all the corps and divisions of your Army and to many of the
                            provinces under attack by the Viet Cong. As I mentioned to you, the
                            primary purpose of these visits was to determine the rate of progress
                            being made by our common effort toward victory over the insurgency. I
                            would define victory in this context as being the reduction of the
                            insurgency to proportions manageable by the National Security Forces
                            normally available to your Government.</p>
                        <p>To keep the length of this letter within bounds, I shall not dwell on the
                            many encouraging indications of military progress since my visit of last
                            September. Certainly, if one looks back to October 1961 when we first
                            discussed the expansion of the U.S. Military Aid and laid the groundwork
                            for the Counterinsurgency Program now in course of implementation, the
                            advances made in defeating the enemy in the field and giving security to
                            the rural population in strategic hamlets testify to the basic soundness
                            of the agreed program. It was not until the recent political
                            disturbances beginning in May and continuing through August and beyond
                            that I personally had any doubt as to the ultimate success of our
                            campaign against the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>Now, as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has
                            told you, a serious doubt hangs over our hopes for the future. Can we
                            win together in the face of the reaction to the measures taken by your
                            Government against the Buddhists and the students? As a military man I
                            would say that we can win providing there are no further political
                            setbacks. The military indicators are still generally favorable and can
                            be made more so by actions readily within the power of your Government.
                            If you will allow me, I would mention a few of the military actions
                            which I believe necessary for this improvement.</p>
                        <p>The military situation in the I, II, and III Corps areas is generally
                            good. It is true that there are never enough offensive actions against
                            the enemy to satisfy one who believes that only a ruthless, tireless <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0355"/>offensive can win this war. The
                            record of one of the divisions in the III Corps falls notably short of
                            the minimum standard for mobile actions in the field set by your High
                            Command-twenty days out of every thirty. As a result, some of the hard
                            core war zones of the Viet Cong remain virtually untouched. In my
                            opinion, the full potential of the military units in this area is not
                            being exploited.</p>
                        <p>But as you have recognized, your principal military problems are now in
                            the Delta. I am convinced that your decision last year was sound in
                            giving top priority to resisting the desire of the enemy to cut through
                            to the coast in the II Corps area and thus divide the country. The
                            success in frustrating this tactic was achieved at the expense of the
                            campaign in the south where the Viet Cong have always had their
                            principal sources of strength. Now, I feel sure, the time has come to
                            regroup our forces and place the center of gravity of our efforts in the
                            IV Corps area. You have wisely recognized this need for readjustment by
                            ordering the 9th Division to the south. I feel that other measures with
                            a similar purpose are or soon will be necessary. I have in mind actions
                            such as an overhaul of the hamlet program in such provinces as Long An
                            and Kien Tuong where the work has gone either too fast or too slow-in
                            either case, with the effect of delaying the attainment of an adequate
                            system of completed hamlets meeting the standards set by your
                            Government. Related to the requirements of a successful hamlet program
                            is the need for a methodical clear-and-hold campaign by the tactical
                            units of the IV Corps. I have a feeling that, in the past, there has
                            been an inclination to favor the rapid, sweeping operations which have
                            little permanent effect in securing a base for the erection of secure
                            hamlets.</p>
                        <p>You know full well the nature of the terrain of the Delta. Even to the
                            casual visitor, it is apparent that we must learn to use the numerous
                            waterways of the region as highways to open up controlled territory and
                            at the same time to interdict the water-borne movement of the enemy. I
                            doubt that we have given enough attention to small boat operations
                            directed at exploiting these waterways in support of the campaign.</p>
                        <p>The kind of war we are fighting in the Delta is a small unit war, fought
                            principally by small infantry-type organizations. These are the forces
                            which bear the brunt of combat and take the inevitable losses. Yet I
                            found on my recent visit that the infantry companies in the Delta and
                            elsewhere are often less than two-thirds of authorized strength—a
                            hundred men for duty out of a company of an authorized strength of about
                            150 men. The diversion of military manpower between the point of intake
                            and the front-line is a problem of all armies in time of war. I would
                            suggest that you may desire a close examination of this problem in your
                            Army. Headquarters soldiers do not hurt the Viet Cong—infantrymen with
                            rifles in the jungle do.</p>
                        <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0356"/>
                        <p>In closing, Mr. President, may I give you my most important overall
                            impression? Up to now, the battle against the Viet Cong has seemed
                            endless; no one has been willing to set a date for its successful
                            conclusion. After talking to scores of officers, Vietnamese and
                            American, I am convinced that the Viet Cong insurgency in the north and
                            center can be reduced to little more than sporadic incidents by the end
                            of 1964. The Delta will take longer but should be completed by the end
                            of 1965. But for these predictions to be valid, certain conditions must
                            be met. Your Government should be prepared to energize all agencies,
                            military and civil, to a higher output of activity than up to now.
                            Ineffective commanders and province officials must be replaced as soon
                            as identified. Finally, there should be a restoration of domestic
                            tranquillity on the homefront if political tensions are to be allayed
                            and external criticism is to abate. Conditions are needed for the
                            creation of an atmosphere conducive to an effective campaign directed at
                            the objective, vital to both of us, of defeating the Viet Cong and of
                            restoring peace to your country.</p>
                        <p>I hope, Mr. President, that you will accept these frank comments as those
                            of an old friend of South Vietnam and an admirer of its courageous
                            resistance to the common enemy. Both of our countries have put too much
                            into this war to be satisfied now with less than a victorious
                            conclusion. I am convinced that the energized program outlined above can
                            achieve the success which we seek.</p>

                                expressed its concern “with the serious violation of the human
                                rights of the vast majority of people” of South Vietnam. The second
                                operative paragraph requested the Secretary-General: “To communicate
                                this res to authorities of South Vietnam, to consult with them with
                                a view to alleviating the situation, to take all appropriate steps
                                to help restore the human rights of the people of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, and to keep the GA informed of
                                developments relating to this situation.” The draft resolution was
                                transmitted in telegram 1076 from USUN, October 1. (Ibid., Central

                            regarding Viet-Nam may be made by other delegations. If any formal
                            proposals are made they would, of course, be referred to the Department
                            by USUN for instructions.</p>
                        <p>It may well be, however, that political suggestions or comments regarding
                            Viet-Nam may be made as obiter dicta in speeches to the General Assembly
                            or during corridor conversations. It would seem desirable that we have
                            approved lines of reply for U.S. representatives to use at their
                            discretion to insure that U.S. views are clearly known before ideas and

                            Communist authorities in North Viet-Nam will stop their campaign to <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0358"/>destroy the Republic of
                            Viet-Nam, the measures we are taking to assist [South Viet-Nam's]
                            defense efforts will no longer be necessary.” Thus, if the Communist
                            regime in Hanoi will cease and desist in its subversive aggression
                            against the Republic of Viet-Nam, the United States can withdraw its

                        <p>Proposed U.S. Response: Neutralization of South Viet-Nam alone would pave
                            the way for an early Communist take-over of that area. Without external
                            assistance the armed forces of South Viet-Nam could not withstand the
                            aggressive pressures of the much larger armed forces of the Communist
                            regime in North Viet-Nam. Moreover, the Hanoi regime, as is currently
                            obvious, has developed an extensive subversive and guerrilla network in
                            South Viet-Nam which could at any time overthrow the government of a
                            neutral South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>If there is to be any discussion of the neutralization of Viet-Nam, it
                            can only be in terms of the neutralization of all of Viet-Nam when the
                            Communists in North Viet-Nam are prepared to agree to give up political
                            power and control in their zone.</p>

                                    Cleveland</persName>'s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName> on U.N. matters affecting

                                informed Cleveland that South Vietnam would welcome a visit by an
                                informal group of countries to get the facts on the Buddhist
                                situation. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName> believed
                                such a visit would have an ameliorating effect on concern about the
                                Buddhist crisis at the United Nations, and hoped Secretary-General U
                                Thant would arrange it. The visit proposal was the result of a
                                genuine desire by South Vietnam to show the world that the Buddhist
                                crisis was over, but <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName>
                                noted the Ceylonese resolution should not be debated until the group
                                returned. The Department of State agreed and suggested to USUN that
                                if U Thant was willing to accept and sponsor the idea, the Mission
                                should discreetly work for postponement of consideration of the
                                Ceylonese resolution. (Department of State, Central Files, SOC 14-1

                            <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> made following major
                            points. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName> subsequently
                            informed us he had immediately reported by cable to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. U.S. opinion had been and remained deeply affected by repressions
                            against religious and student groups which inexplicable to US public in
                            light of major burden we undertaking on side of Vietnamese in effort to
                            win war against Communists.</p>
                        <p>2. As President said, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> needs broadest
                            possible political support to win war and therefore should make changes
                            of policy and perhaps personnel. Our own policy insofar as <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concerned clearly stated by President;
                            we support what furthers war effort; we oppose what hinders it.</p>
                        <p>3. Rightly or wrongly, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s present
                            image is unfavorable and positive steps must be taken to change it.
                            There should be far less talk on part of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> personalities and more action. President should now
                            generously dramatize desire for conciliation. Calling Buddhist priests
                            Communists is not answer. Answer lies instead in releasing them and
                            students on wide scale. President should bring eminent individuals into
                            a broadened and rejuvenated cabinet.</p>
                        <p>In his responses, <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName> indicated
                            religious part of crisis over even before pagoda raids August 20. Crisis
                            had become entirely political and bonzes had overextended position to
                            point where govt had to force showdown to survive. As Buddhist and
                            humanist, <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName> regretted
                            deplorable manner in which pagoda raids carried out. He noted that aged
                            Venerable Khiet had now reversed his position and that by letter of
                            September 27 to Diem Bonze Chau had done same. (For Saigon: Please

                            current problem boiled down to one of personnel: finding right people
                            and letting them do job without constant interference and favoritism.
                            Hoped that new Assembly would assume active role and thereby reveal to
                            world that changes are occurring. Did not think there would be real
                            problem in overhauling government, but that bringing conviction of
                            change to countryside and outlying areas would, as before, be real

                            his departure. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> replied
                            that US officials felt <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had
                            made important contribution to strategic hamlet program but that he had
                            apparently become political symbol to many Vietnamese. If this true
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> should consider
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s future role very
                            carefully. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s talents cannot be spared but that
                            his only ambition was to work in narrowly prescribed field of his

                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s role was to be limited
                            President might consider how to dramatize this, perhaps through device

                            for government reform in structure and functioning. Wished in particular

                        <p>After our long and useful discussion with <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu
                                Hoi</persName> in my office this morning, I had a short, private
                            tete-a-tete with him. I wanted to be sure that he understood that we
                            have wanted to be helpful to him on the procedure he is floating in New
                            York (which is described as he described it in our reporting cable to
                                <persName corresp="#p_STEVENSON1">Stevenson</persName>),<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">
                                <ref target="#d165">Document 165</ref>.</note> but that we could not
                            be caught in the role of an apologist for the Viet Nam Government on the
                            substance of the matter, as long as most of the world is convinced that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has been persecuting
                            Buddhists.</p>
                        <p>I took the occasion also to ask, in the politest and most Oriental
                            fashion you can imagine, whether steps were being taken to tone down
                                <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>'s public
                            utterances, at least on this particular subject, while she is in the
                            United States. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> said quite
                            frankly that in his judgment she had done much damage with her
                            statements. He agreed that the word “barbeque” had been especially
                            damaging; he complained that she did not even know the word, which would
                            not be as colorful in the French language, but had picked it up from “an
                            English language publication in Saigon”, by which I suppose he means the
                            American edited Times of Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> went on to say that he
                            had fully reported the nature of the damage since his arrival here; he
                            had sent in five reports just on this subject, he said. Instructions had
                            already gone to <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> to
                            quiet down but in view of the interest of the U.S. press he did not see
                            what practical effect they would have. He said, a little wistfully, that
                            he did not suppose it would be possible to persuade the press to take no
                            interest in her.</p>
                        <p>Finally, he made a practical suggestion that we could perhaps help them
                            do what he has been trying to do, without too much success, in talking
                            with representatives of the U.S. press. He has been trying to emphasize,
                            he said, that he himself has been especially sent to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to handle this question, that he and what
                            he says represents <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0362"/>the
                            Government of Viet Nam, and that <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame
                                Nhu</persName> is traveling in a private capacity and is not
                            speaking for the Government. He conceded that this was a hard sale, but
                            asked that we do our best.</p>
                        <p>It does seem to me that we can be a little bit helpful in this by
                            emphasizing to editors and correspondents—particularly the editors and
                            particularly in New York—that <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu
                                Hoia</persName> is the man who is talking responsibly for the
                            Government of Viet Nam and that his responsible and sophisticated
                            attempts to deal with the situation should not be interfered with by
                            press magnification of quotable comments by a lady who is unfortunately
                            too beautiful to ignore. I passed this suggestion along to Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_STEVENSON1">Stevenson</persName>. You will
                            know best what to do with it on this end.</p>

                        <p rend="center">I. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Conclusions.</p>
                        <p>1. The military campaign has made great progress and continues to
                            progress.</p>
                        <p>2. There are serious political tensions in Saigon (and perhaps elsewhere
                            in South Vietnam) where the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            government is becoming increasingly unpopular.</p>
                        <p>3. There is no solid evidence of the possibility of a successful coup,
                            although assassination of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            or <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is always a
                            possibility.</p>
                        <p>4. Although some, and perhaps an increasing number, of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military officers are becoming hostile
                            to the government, they are more hostile to the Viet Cong than to the
                            government and at least for the near future they will continue to
                            perform their military duties.</p>
                        <p>5. Further repressive actions by <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            could change the present favorable military trends. On the other hand, a
                            return to more moderate methods of control and administration, unlikely
                            though it may be, would substantially mitigate the political crisis.</p>
                        <p>6. It is not clear that pressures exerted by the U.S. will move <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> toward moderation. Indeed, pressures may increase
                            their obduracy. But unless such pressures are exerted, they are almost
                            certain to continue past patterns of behavior.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Recommendations.</p>
                        <p>We recommend that:</p>
                        <p>1. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> review with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> the military changes
                            necessary to complete the military campaign in the Northern and Central
                            areas (I, II, and III Corps) by the end of 1964, and in the Delta (IV
                            Corps) by the end of 1965. This review would consider the need for such
                            changes as:</p>
                        <p>a. A further shift of military emphasis and strength to the Delta (IV
                            Corps).</p>
                        <p>b. An increase in the military tempo in all corps areas, so that all
                            combat troops are in the field an average of 20 days out of 30 and
                            static missions are ended.</p>
                        <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0364"/>
                        <p>c. Emphasis on “clear and hold operations” instead of terrain sweeps
                            which have little permanent value.</p>
                        <p>d. The expansion of personnel in combat units to full authorized
                            strength.</p>
                        <p>e. The training and arming of hamlet militia to an accelerated rate,
                            especially in the Delta.</p>
                        <p>f. A consolidation of the strategic hamlet program, especially in the
                            Delta, and action to insure that future strategic hamlets are not built
                            until they can be protected, and until civic action programs can be
                            introduced.</p>
                        <p>2. A program be established to train Vietnamese so that essential
                            functions now performed by U.S. military personnel can be carried out by
                            Vietnamese by the end of 1965. It should be possible to withdraw the
                            bulk of U.S. personnel by that time.</p>
                        <p>3. In accordance with the program to train progressively Vietnamese to
                            take over military functions, the Defense Department should announce in
                            the very near future presently prepared plans to withdraw 1000 U.S.
                            military personnel by the end of 1963. This action should be explained
                            in low key as an initial step in a long-term program to replace U.S.
                            personnel with trained Vietnamese without impairment of the war
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>4. The following actions be taken to impress upon <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> our disapproval of his political
                            program.</p>
                        <p>a. Continue to withhold commitment of funds in the commodity import
                            program, but avoid a formal announcement. The potential significance of
                            the withholding of commitments for the 1964 military budget should be
                            brought home to the top military officers in working level contacts
                            between <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> and the Joint General Staff; up to
                            now we have stated $95 million may be used by the Vietnamese as a
                            planning level for the commodity import program for 1964. Henceforth we
                            could make clear that this is uncertain both because of lack of final
                            appropriation action by the Congress and because of executive
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>b. Suspend approval of the pending <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            loans for the Saigon-Cholon Waterworks and Saigon Electric Power
                            Project. We should state clearly that we are doing so as a matter of
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>c. Advise <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            support for designated units, now under Colonel <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName>'s control (mostly held in or near
                            the Saigon area for political reasons) will be cut off unless these
                            units are promptly assigned to the full authority of the Joint General
                            Staff and transferred to the field.</p>
                        <p>d. Maintain the present purely “correct” relations with the top <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and specifically between the
                            Ambassador and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. Contact
                            between General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and

                            should not, however, be suspended, as this remains an important channel
                            of advice. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> should also seek to maintain contacts
                            where these are needed to push forward programs in support of the effort
                            in the field, while taking care not to cut across <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0365"/>the basic picture of U.S. disapproval
                            and uncertainty of U.S. aid intentions. We should work with the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government but not
                            support it.<note n="3" xml:id="d167fn3">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> believes that the official “correct”

                        </p>
                        <p>As we pursue these courses of action, the situation must be closely
                            watched to see what steps <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            is taking to reduce repressive practices and to improve the
                            effectiveness of the military effort. We should set no fixed criteria,
                            but recognize that we would have to decide in 2-4 months whether to move
                            to more drastic action or try to carry on with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> even if he had not taken
                            significant steps.</p>
                        <p>5. At this time, no initiative should be taken to encourage actively a
                            change in government. Our policy should be to seek urgently to identify
                            and build contacts with an alternative leadership if and when it
                            appears.</p>
                        <p>6. The following statement be approved as current U.S. policy toward
                            South Vietnam and constitute the substance of the government position to
                            be presented both in Congressional testimony and in public
                            statements.</p>
                        <p>a. The security of South Vietnam remains vital to United States security.
                            For this reason, we adhere to the overriding objective of denying this
                            country to Communism and of suppressing the Viet Cong insurgency as
                            promptly as possible. (By suppressing the insurgency we mean reducing it
                            to proportions manageable by the national security forces of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, unassisted by the presence of U.S.
                            military forces.) We believe the U.S. part of the task can be completed
                            by the end of 1965, the terminal date which we are taking as the time
                            objective of our counterinsurgency programs.</p>
                        <p>b. The military program in Vietnam has made progress and is sound in
                            principle.</p>
                        <p>c. The political situation in Vietnam remains deeply serious. It has not
                            yet significantly affected the military effort, but could do so at some
                            time in the future. If the result is a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ineffective in the conduct of the war, the U.S. will
                            review its attitude toward support for the government. Although we are
                            deeply concerned by repressive practices, effective performance in the
                            conduct of the war should be the determining factor in our relations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>d. The U.S. has expressed its disapproval of certain actions of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> regime and will do so again if
                            required. Our policy is to seek to bring about the abandonment of
                            repression because of its effect on the popular will to resist. Our
                            means consist of expressions of disapproval and the withholding of
                            support from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> activities that are not
                            clearly contributing to the war effort. We will use these means as
                            required to assure an effective military program.</p>

                        <p>From the above analysis it is clear that the situation requires a
                            constant effort by the U.S. to obtain a reduction of political tensions
                            and improved performance by the Vietnamese Government. We cannot say
                            with assurance whether the effort against the Viet Cong will ultimately
                            fail in the absence of major political improvements. However, it does
                            seem clear that after another period of repressive action progress may
                            be reduced and indeed reversed. Although the present momentum might
                            conceivably continue to carry the effort forward even if <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> remains in power and political
                            tensions continue, any significant slowing in the rate of progress would
                            surely have a serious effect on U.S. popular support for the U.S.
                            effort.</p>

                        <p>U.S. personnel in Saigon might adopt an attitude of coolness toward their
                            Vietnamese counterparts, maintaining only those contacts and
                            communications which are necessary for the actual conduct of operations
                            in the field. To some extent this is the attitude already adopted by the
                            Ambassador himself, but it could be extended to the civilian and
                            military agencies located in Saigon. The effect of such action would be
                            largely psychological.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Economic Leverage.</p>
                        <p>Together, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>'s Commodity Import
                            Program (<gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>) and the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 program account for between 60 and 70
                            percent of imports into Vietnam. The commitment of funds under the
                                <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> has already been suspended.
                                <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> deliveries result in the
                            generation of piastres, most of which go to the support of the defense
                            budget. It is estimated that <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>
                            pipelines will remain relatively large for some five or six months, and
                            within this time period there would not be a serious material effect.
                            Even within this period, however, the flow of piastres to support the
                            defense budget will gradually begin to decline and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will be forced to draw down its foreign
                            exchange reserves or curtail its military expenditures.</p>
                        <p>Within the domestic economy the existing large pipelines would mean that
                            there would be no material reason for inflation to begin in the short
                            term period. However, the psychological effect of growing realization
                            that the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> program has been suspended
                            might be substantial <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0367"/>in 2-4
                            months. Saigon has a large number of speculative traders, and although
                            there is considerable police effort to control prices, this might not be
                            able to contain a general trend of speculation and hoarding. Once
                            inflation did develop, it could have a serious effect on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> budget and the conduct of the war.</p>
                        <p>Apart from <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>, two major <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> projects are up for final approval—the
                            Saigon-Cholon Waterworks ($9 million) and the Saigon Electric Power
                            Project ($4 million). Suspension of these projects would be a possible
                            means of demonstrating to Congress and the world that we disapprove of
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policies and are not providing
                            additional aid not directly essential to the war effort.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Paramilitary and Other Assistance.</p>
                        <p>(1) <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> assistance to the Combat Police
                            and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> assistance to the Director General of Information and

                            suspended. These projects involve a relatively small amount of local
                            currency but their suspension, particularly in the case of <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, might adversely affect programs
                            which the U.S. wishes to see progress.</p>
                        <p>(2) However, there would be merit in a gesture aimed at Colonel <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName>, the Special Forces Commander,
                            whose forces in or near Saigon played a conspicuous part in the pagoda
                            affair and are a continuing support for <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. Colonel <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> commands a mixed complex of forces, some of which
                            are supported by <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and others
                            presently through <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. All of those now
                            in or near Saigon were trained either for combat missions or for special
                            operations into North Vietnam and Laos. Purely on grounds of their not
                            being used for their proper missions, the U.S. could inform <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that we would cut off <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            support unless they were placed directly under Joint General Staff and
                            were committed to field operations.</p>
                        <p>The practical effect of the cut-off would probably be small. The
                            equipment cannot be taken out of the hands of the units, and the pay
                            provided to some units could be made up from the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> budget. Psychologically, however, the significance of
                            the gesture might be greater. At the least it would remove one target of
                            press criticism of the U.S., and would probably also be welcomed by the
                            high military officers in Vietnam, and certainly by the disaffected
                            groups in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, support should continue, but through General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> rather than <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, for border surveillance and other
                            similar field operations that are contributing to the war effort.</p>
                        <p>We have weighed this cut-off action carefully. It runs a risk that
                            Colonel <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> would refuse to
                            carry out external operations against the Lao corridor and North
                            Vietnam. It might also limit <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s
                            access to the military. However, U.S. liaison with high military

                            fully maintained through the U.S. military advisors. On balance, we
                            conclude that these possible disadvantages are outweighed by the gains
                            implicit in this action.</p>
                        <p>(3) Consideration has been given both by <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and the military (principally the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> in Washington) to the possibility of
                            redirecting economic and military assistance in such a fashion as to
                            bypass the central government in Saigon. Military studies have shown the
                            technical feasibility, though with great difficulty and cost, of
                            supplying the war effort in the countryside over lines of communications
                            which do not involve Saigon, and it is assumed that the same conclusions
                            would apply to <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> deliveries to the
                            field under the rural strategic hamlet program. However, there is a
                            consensus among U.S. agencies in Saigon that such an effort is not
                            practical in the face of determined opposition by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> unless, of course, a situation had
                            developed where the central government was no longer in control of some
                            areas of the country. Nor is it at all clear that such diversion would
                            operate to build up the position of the military or to cut down
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s position.</p>

                        <p>Although the capability of <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> to
                            support the United States campaign of pressure against the regime would
                            be small, the Ambassador believes consideration must be given to the
                            content and timing of the United States pronouncements outside the
                            country. He has already suggested the use of the Voice of America in
                            stimulating, in its broadcasts to Vietnamese, discussions of democratic
                            political philosophies. This medium could be used to exploit a wide
                            range of ascending political pressure. In addition, a phased program of
                            United States official pronouncements could be developed for use in
                            conjunction with the other leverages as they are applied. We must
                            recognize the possibility that such actions may incite <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to strong countermeasures.</p>

                        <p>Coupled with all the above there is the implicit leverage embodied in our
                            constantly making it plain to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and others that the long term continuation of

                        <p>A program of limited pressures, such as the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> suspension, will not have large material effects on the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> or the war effort, at least for
                            2-4 months. The psychological effects could be greater, and there is
                            some evidence that the suspension is already causing concern to <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0369"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. However, the effect of
                            pressures that can be carried out over an extended period without
                            detriment to the war effort is probably limited with respect to the
                            possibility of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> making
                            necessary changes.</p>
                        <p>We have not analyzed with care what the effect might be of a far more
                            intensive level of pressure such as cessation of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> deliveries or long continued suspension of the
                            commodity import program. If the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government should fail to make major improvements,
                            serious consideration would have to be given to this possible course of
                            action, but we believe its effect on the war effort would be so
                            serious—in psychological if not in immediate material terms—that it
                            should not be undertaken at the present time.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Prospects of a Spontaneous Coup.</p>
                        <p>The prospects of an early spontaneous replacement of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Regime are not high. The two
                            principal sources of such an attempt, the senior military officers and
                            the students, have both been neutralized by a combination of their own
                            inability and the regime's effective countermeasures of control. The
                            student organizations have been emasculated. The students themselves
                            have displayed more emotion than determination and they are apparently
                            being handled with sufficient police sophistication to avoid an
                            explosion.</p>
                        <p>The generals appear to have little stomach for the difficult job of
                            secretly arranging the necessary coalescence of force to upset the
                            Regime.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> are keenly aware of the capability of the generals
                            to take over the country, utilizing the tremendous power now vested in
                            the military forces. They, therefore, concentrate their manipulative
                            talent on the general officers, by transfers, and by controls over key
                            units and their locations. They are aware that these actions may reduce
                            efficiency, but they tolerate it rather than risk the prospect that they
                            be overthrown and their social revolution frustrated. They have
                            established a praetorian guard to guarantee considerable bloodshed if
                            any attack is made. The generals have seen slim hope of surmounting
                            these difficulties without prohibitive risk to themselves, the unity of
                            the Army and the Establishment itself.</p>
                        <p>Despite these unfavorable prospects for action in the short term, new
                            factors could quickly arise, such as the death of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> or an unpredictable and even
                            irrational attack launched by a junior officer group, which would call
                            urgently for U.S. support or counteraction. In such a case, the best
                            alternative would appear to be the support of constitutional continuity
                            in the person of the Vice President, behind whom arrangements could be
                            developed for a more permanent replacement after a transitional
                            period.</p>

                                text.]</note> Initially, only a strongly authoritarian regime would
                            be able to pull the government together and maintain order. In view of
                            the pre-eminent role of the military in Vietnam today, it is probable
                            that this role would be filled by a military officer, perhaps taking
                            power after the selective process of a junta dispute. Such an
                            authoritarian military regime, perhaps after an initial period of
                            euphoria at the departure of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, would
                            be apt to entail a resumption of the repression at least of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, the corruption of the Vietnamese
                            Establishment before <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, and
                            an emphasis on conventional military rather than social, economic and
                            political considerations, with at least an equivalent degree of
                            xenophobic nationalism.</p>
                        <p>These features must be weighed, however, against the possible results of

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Possible U.S. Actions.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, clear and explicit U.S. support could make a great difference
                            to the chances of a coup. However, at the present time we lack a clear
                            picture of what acceptable individuals might be brought to the point of
                            action, or what kind of government might emerge. We therefore need an
                            intensive clandestine effort, under the Ambassador's direction, to
                            establish necessary contacts to allow the U.S. to continuously appraise
                            coup prospects.</p>
                        <p>If and when we have a better picture, the choice will still remain
                            difficult whether we would prefer to take our chances on a spontaneous
                            coup (assuming some action by <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            would trigger it) or to risk U.S. prestige and having the U.S. hand show
                            with a coup group which appeared likely to be a better alternative
                            government. Any regime that was identified from the outset as a U.S.
                            “puppet” would have disadvantages both within South Vietnam and in
                            significant areas of the world, including other underdeveloped nations
                            where the U.S. has a major role.</p>
                        <p>In any case, whether or not it proves to be wise to promote a coup at a
                            later time, we must be ready for the possibility of a spontaneous coup,
                            and this too requires clandestine contacts on an intensive basis.</p>

                        <p rend="center">IX. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE POLICIES</p>
                        <p>Broadly speaking, we believe there are three alternative policies the
                            U.S. could pursue to achieve its political and military objectives:</p>
                        <p>1. Return to avowed support of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime and attempt to obtain the necessary
                            improvements through persuasion from a posture of “reconciliation.” This
                            would not mean any expression of approval of the repressive actions of
                            the regime, but simply that we would go back in practice to business as
                            usual.</p>
                        <p>2. Follow a policy of selective pressures: “purely correct” relationships
                            at the top official level, continuing to withhold further actions in the
                            commodity import program, and making clear our disapproval of the
                            regime. A further element in this policy is letting the present
                            impression stand that the U.S. would not be averse to a change of
                            Government—although we would not take any immediate actions to initiate
                            a coup.</p>
                        <p>3. Start immediately to promote a coup by high ranking military officers.
                            This policy might involve more extended suspensions of aid and sharp
                            denunciations of the regime's actions so timed as to fit with coup
                            prospects and planning.</p>
                        <p>Our analysis of these alternatives is as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Reconciliation.</p>
                        <p>We believe that this course of action would be ineffective from the
                            standpoint of events in South Vietnam alone, and would also greatly
                            increase our difficulties in justifying the present U.S. support effort
                            both to the Congress and generally to significant third nations. We are
                            most unlikely, after recent events, to get <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to make the necessary changes; on the contrary, he
                            would almost certainly regard our reconciliation as an evidence that the
                            U.S. would sit still for just about anything he did. The result would
                            probably be not only a continuation of the destructive elements in the
                            Regime's policies but a return to larger scale repressions as and when
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> thought they were necessary. The
                            result would probably be sharp deterioration in the military situation
                            in a fairly short period.</p>
                        <p>2. Selective Pressures.</p>
                        <p>We have examined numerous possibilities of applying pressures to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in order to incline him
                            to the direction of our policies. The most powerful instrument at our
                            disposal is the control of military and economic aid but any
                            consideration of its use reveals the double-edged nature of its effects.
                            Any long-term reduction of aid cannot but have an eventual adverse
                            effect on the military campaign since both the military and the economic
                            programs have been consciously designed and justified in terms of their
                            contribution to the war effort. Hence, immediate reductions must be
                            selected carefully and be left in effect only for short periods.</p>
                        <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0372"/>
                        <p>We believe that the present level of pressures is causing, and will
                            cause, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> some concern, while
                            at the same time not significantly impairing the military effort. We are
                            not hopeful that this level (or indeed any level) of pressure will
                            actually induce <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to remove
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> from the picture
                            completely. However, there is a better chance that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will at least be deterred from
                            resuming large scale oppressions.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, there are various factors that set a time limit to
                            pursuing this course of action in its present form. Within 2-4 months we
                            have to make critical decisions with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> about its 1964 budget and our economic support level.
                            In addition, there is a significant and growing possibility that even
                            the present limited actions in the economic field-more for psychological
                            than for economic reasons would start a wave of speculation and
                            inflation that would be difficult to control or bring back into proper
                            shape. As to when we would reverse our present course, the resumption of
                            the full program of economic and military aid should be tied to the
                            actions of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            government.</p>
                        <p>As a foundation for the development of our long-term economic and
                            military aid programs, we believe it may be possible to develop specific
                            military objectives to be achieved on an agreed schedule. The extent to
                            which such objectives are met, in conjunction with an evaluation of the
                            regime's political performance, would determine the level of aid for the
                            following period.</p>
                        <p>3. Organizing a Coup.</p>
                        <p>For the reasons stated earlier, we believe this course of action should
                            not be undertaken at the present time.</p>
                        <p>On balance we consider that the most promising course of action to adopt
                            at this time is an application of selective short-term pressures,
                            principally economic, and the conditioning of long-term aid on the
                            satisfactory performance by the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government in meeting military and political
                            objectives which in the aggregate equate to the requirements of final
                            victory. The specific actions recommended in Section I of this report
                            are consistent with this policy.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary started the conversation by noting that in order to achieve
                            the goal of security and independence for the Republic of Vietnam, it
                            would be necessary first to defeat the Viet-Cong. US policy on this
                            matter is as clear as is our commitment to the goal. As Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> well knew, we have
                            been seriously concerned about our ability to achieve this goal because
                            of what appeared to be a shattering of solidarity in South Vietnam, a
                            loss of confidence by the people in their government. As Mao
                                Tse-<persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> had once observed,
                            if the people are in support of the guerillas, every bush becomes an
                            ally. Until recently we were confident that the bushes in South Vietnam
                            were our allies, but we were no longer sure. He expected shortly to
                            receive Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s
                                report,<note n="2" xml:id="d168fn2">
                                <ref target="#d167">Document 167</ref>.</note> but had not as yet
                            seen it.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> said that he did not
                            deny much of what had been said, but he felt that things were not
                            necessarily what they appeared to be, and that the full scope of the
                            struggle had to be kept in mind. The present fight is not a fight of
                            today's battles, or even a year-to-year struggle; rather, the fight
                            spans the time of a generation. To win we must encourage followers of
                            the Viet-Cong to switch over to our side. At the same time we must
                            prevent any drain from our side either by those who defect to the
                            Viet-Cong or by those who might simply leave the country. He felt that
                            no government has had worse public relations than his, a fact which he
                            believed stems from their past reliance on foreigners for public
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>Addressing himself to the immediate situation, <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> said that “<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is indispensable, and yet <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> must clearly be eliminated”.</p>
                        <p>He digressed to review recent events which originated in the city of Hue,
                            center of the Buddhist faith in South Vietnam, yet a city which at the
                            same time retains its traditional role as “a hotbed of revolt”.</p>
                        <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0374"/>
                        <p>Stating that he was convinced that these were the facts, <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> said that an approach had been
                            made to His Holiness Pope John suggesting that President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s brother, Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_THUC1">Thuc</persName>, be named Archbishop in Saigon.
                            Pope John had recognized the political overtones of this request and had
                            settled on the city of Hue as a compromise. This was how the President's
                            brother became named as Archbishop in Hue, not long ago.</p>
                        <p>But the President had another brother, Can, who also lived in Hue, was a
                            militant nationalist with a very poor press reputation. Can was a
                            sincere friend of Buddhists in Hue and was, in fact, the source through
                            whom funds were passed by the government to the Buddhist hierarchy in
                            Hue. And when his elder brother, Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_THUC1">Thuc</persName> arrived in Hue, local officials deserted Can in
                            favor of the elder brother who appeared to be closer to the President.
                            This led to a feeling of despair and hopelessness on the part of
                            Buddhists in that city. The demonstrations which erupted in Hue in early
                            May were triggered by orders from Saigon that the Buddhist flag should
                            be pulled down; Can had earlier assured the Buddhists that they should
                            fly their flag and that he would take responsibility for keeping their
                            flag up.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> noted that it was
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, not Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, who ordered the Buddhist
                            flag pulled down in Hue.</p>
                        <p>He said that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had put the
                            all-important ideological content into the fight with his strategic
                            hamlet program. He, <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName>,
                            regretted to state that he is convinced that the “top of the government
                            is rotten” and that the strategic hamlet program is an absolutely
                            necessary counterpart to this rottenness. For these reasons he was
                            convinced that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is an
                            indispensable figure for the successful conduct of the overall
                            struggle.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if it could be demonstrated that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is not an all-controlling influence
                            in the government.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> said that the US should
                            urge <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to appoint <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to the specific job of running the
                            strategic hamlet program. Posing the question of whom this would leave
                            to run the government, <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName>
                            said such a man would be <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>,
                            who he felt was already the equivalent of a Prime Minister. He noted
                            that <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> is purely an
                            administrator, neither corrupt nor ambitious, and not interested in
                            politics.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_STEVENSON1">Stevenson</persName> asked if
                            what Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> had
                            described suggested the need for a change in Hue. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> said that he believed that the
                            present Pope would be willing to make a change.</p>
                        <p>He recalled that he had earlier said that <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> must go. He felt that President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was still convinced that she is
                            not harmful, and he felt that the President needs to be told just how
                            harmful she is. He said that he and others have been doing their best to
                            prevent her from coming here, and he remarked that Vice President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s letter to <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> might be helpful if shown to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0375"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said his impression remained that both Mr. and Mrs.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> exerted a harmful
                            influence. The Secretary believed it was still necessary for the
                            government to build solidarity. He agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had made an important contribution
                            in the strategic hamlet program. But he felt that it would be hard to
                            get anything done in the government if fear and suspicion pervades its
                            top level.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> regretted that he had to
                            say much of the harm was done by the President himself, often the
                            President made harmful decisions despite his brother's (<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>) advice to the contrary. He cited
                            in this instance the order to pull the flags down in Hue (with the
                            implication that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had not
                            favored this order). <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> felt
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had only recently
                            emerged from his previous “backroom” role into the public eye. He
                            thought this might have resulted from <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame
                                Nhu</persName>'s influence.</p>
                        <p>In general terms, <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> felt it
                            absolutely necessary to convince the President that he must set up a
                            cabinet in which each member would stand or fall purely on the basis of
                            performance. In this scheme of things, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> should be given the task of running the strategic
                            hamlet program, and should at the same time again resume his role as a
                            “backroom” advisor.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary wondered if it would be important to remove <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> from the palace and to make his
                            wife cease her palace operations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> did not believe this
                            would be a problem; it might not even be necessary for the <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>s to remove themselves from Saigon,
                            but he agreed that they should be removed from the palace itself.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then fumed to the immediate situation at the UN which
                            has been reported separately by telegram, Secto 51 to the
                                Department.<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">In Secto 51, October 2, USUN

                                about to raise with U Thant the idea of an ad hoc mission of leading
                                international personalities to examine the Buddhist problem in South
                                Vietnam. To dispel suspicion that this might be a stalling device,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> would assure U
                                Thant that the Government of Vietnam did not oppose reopening the

                                question from <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> said that mission members
                                would be free to investigate the problem in South Vietnam as they
                                chose. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoia</persName> stated that he
                                and his government felt this way because there was no longer a
                                Buddhist problem in South Vietnam. (Department of State, Central

                        <p>The President opened the meeting by summarizing where we now stand on
                            U.S. policy toward Vietnam. Most of the officials involved are in
                            agreement. We are not papering over our differences. We are agreed to
                            try to find effective means of changing the political atmosphere in
                            Saigon. We are agreed that we should not cut off all U.S. aid to
                            Vietnam, but are agreed on the necessity of trying to improve the
                            situation in Vietnam by bringing about changes there. Reports of
                            disagreements do not help the war effort in Vietnam and do no good to
                            the government as a whole. We must all sign on and with good heart set
                            out to implement the actions decided upon. Here and in Saigon we must
                            get ahead by carrying out the agreed policy. Because we are agreed, we
                            should convey our agreement to our subordinates. There are no
                            differences between Washington and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> or among the State and Defense
                            Departments and the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> has full authority to
                            pull into line all U.S. government representatives in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>The President then turned to consideration of the draft public statement
                            (copy attached).<note n="2" xml:id="d169fn2">Not attached, but see <ref target="#d170">Document 170</ref>.</note> He said that attacks
                            on the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime in public
                            statements are less effective than actions which we plan to take. He
                            preferred to base our policy on the harm which <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s political actions are causing
                            to the effort against the Viet Cong rather than on our moral opposition
                            to the kind of government <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            is running.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that he and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> felt that there
                            should be stress on the moral issues involved because of the beneficial
                            effect which such emphasis produced in world public opinion, especially
                            among UN delegates. The President replied that the major problem was
                            with U.S. public opinion and he believed we should stress the harm
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s policies are doing to
                            the war effort against the Communists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> wanted to emphasize the
                            objective of winning the war. State Department officials wanted
                            something more than an objective of merely winning the war. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> commented that he
                            was prepared to accept the language as proposed.</p>
                        <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0377"/>
                        <p>The President objected to the phrase “by the end of this year” in the
                            sentence “The U.S. program for training Vietnamese should have
                            progressed to the point where 1000 U.S. military personnel assigned to
                            South Vietnam could be withdrawn.” He believed that if we were not able
                            to take this action by the end of this year, we would be accused of
                            being over optimistic.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he saw
                            great value in this sentence in order to meet the view of Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> and others that we
                            are bogged down forever in Vietnam. He said the sentence reveals that we
                            have a withdrawal plan. Furthermore, it commits us to emphasize the
                            training of Vietnamese, which is something we must do in order to
                            replace U.S. personnel with Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>The draft announcement was changed to make both of the time predictions
                            included in paragraph 3 a part of the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                                report<note n="3" xml:id="d169fn3">
                                <ref target="#d167">Document 167</ref>.</note> rather than as
                            predictions of the President.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> raised the question as to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s view of the proposed
                            draft policy statement. He said Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> could be told that because of the time pressure it
                            had not been possible to clear the statement with him, but that it was
                            felt here it would meet his requirements.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked about the measures which we would take to bring
                            pressure on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that a
                            working group would propose recommendations for the President's decision
                            at a later date.</p>
                        <p>The President directed that no one discuss with the press any measures
                            which he may decide to undertake on the basis of the recommendations to
                            be made to him. He said we should not talk about such measures until
                            they are agreed. The selected cuts in U.S. assistance should be
                            discussed only in the Cabinet Room until all of them were finally agreed
                            upon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPEG1">Salinger</persName> said he would
                            decline to answer any press questions about what measures the U.S.
                            proposed to take.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question by Administrator <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName>, the President said he should reply to inquiring
                            Congressmen that we are continuing our present aid schedule. After a
                            further exchange, the President made clear that what he thought we
                            should tell the Congressmen should be limited to saying that aid which
                            we are now extending would be continued. He recognized that aid we are
                            now extending is not that we had been extending prior to the August
                            disturbances.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> should say nothing. The
                            group would return to the President by Friday<note n="4" xml:id="d169fn4">October 4.</note> with specific
                            recommendations.</p>
                        <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0378"/>
                        <p>The President then asked what we should say about the news story
                            attacking <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> which appeared in today's
                            Washington Daily News. He read a draft paragraph for inclusion in the
                            public statement but rejected it as being too fluffy. He felt no one
                            would believe a statement saying that there were no differences of view
                            among the various U.S agencies represented in Saigon. He thought that we
                            should say that now we had a positive policy endorsed by the National
                            Security Council and that such policy would be carried out by all
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> suggested the President direct everyone
                            present not to discuss the paper. Now that a policy decision had been
                            made, we should be absolutely certain that no one continues to talk to
                            the press about differences among U.S agencies.</p>
                        <p>The President said that as of tonight we have a policy and a report
                            endorsed by all the members of the National Security Council.</p>
                        <p>The President asked again about the means we plan to use in changing the
                            political atmosphere in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> discussed the
                            recommendations in paragraph 4 of the report and said the group would be
                            returning to the President with specific actions to be taken.</p>
                        <p>After the President left the meeting, there was a discussion as to how to
                            put into final form the recommendations for the President. It was
                            decided that a sub-group would make more precise the recommendations
                            contained in paragraph 4, and that the group of principals would meet
                            the following day in the absence of the President in order to prepare a
                            paper for him to consider on Friday.<note n="5" xml:id="d169fn5">See

                        </p>
                        <p>The only substantive point that came out in this discussion was Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s belief that
                            economic pressures against <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            should be undertaken over a longer period of time rather than a short
                            period which would produce critical reactions in Saigon.</p>

                                statement is excellent in substance and well-tempered in tone. I am

                        <p>“1. The security of South Viet Nam is a major interest of the United
                            States as other free nations. We will adhere to our policy of working
                            with the people and Government of South Viet Nam to deny this country to
                            Communism and to suppress the externally stimulated and supported
                            insurgency of the Viet Cong as promptly as possible. Effective
                            performance in this undertaking is the central objective of our policy
                            in South Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>“2. The military program in South Viet Nam has made progress and is sound
                            in principle, though improvements are being energetically sought.</p>
                        <p>“3. Major U.S. assistance in support of this military effort is needed
                            only until the insurgency has been suppressed or until the national
                            security forces of the Government of South Viet Nam are capable of
                            suppressing it.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> reported their
                            judgment that the major part of the U.S. military task can be completed
                            by the end of 1965, although there may be a continuing requirement for a
                            limited number of U.S. training personnel. They reported that by the end
                            of this year, the U.S. program for training Vietnamese should have
                            progressed to the point where 1,000 U.S. military personnel assigned to
                            South Viet Nam can be withdrawn.</p>

                        <p>“4. The political situation in South Viet Nam remains deeply serious. The
                            United States has made clear its continuing opposition to any repressive
                            actions in South Viet Nam. While such actions have not yet significantly
                            affected the military effort, they could do so in the future.</p>
                        <p>“5. It remains the policy of the United States, in South Viet Nam as in
                            other parts of the world, to support the efforts of the people of that
                            country to defeat aggression and to build a peaceful and free
                            society.”</p>

                        <p>1385. 1. On 2 Oct 1963 Lt Col Conein accidentally encountered Maj Gen
                                <persName corresp="#p_TVDMG1">Tran Van Don</persName> at Tan Son
                            Nhut Airport. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> stated he had
                            been attempting to make contact with Conein for some time. Requested
                            that Conein come to Nha Trang on night of 2 Oct for private discussion.
                            Conein was noncommittal in his reply.</p>
                        <p>2. Col Conein's visiting Nha Trang to talk with <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> was approved by <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName>'s guidance to Conein
                            was that he neither to encourage nor discourage any coup thinking or
                            action, to elicit information only and not to commit the USG to any
                            action whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>4. Conein met with <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> in Nha
                            Trang on night of 2 Oct for approximately one hour. No other persons
                            were present during the meeting. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> made the following points:</p>
                        <p>a. Duong Van Minh desires to see Conein for private conversation.</p>
                        <p>b. Meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> will take
                            place 0800 hours 5 Oct at Joint General Staff Headquarters, Saigon.</p>
                        <p>c. At that hour Conein is to present himself in uniform at <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>'s office. Cover topic of
                            conversation will be possible relocation of United States Special forces
                            headquarters. (Comment: This is a cover topic <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0381"/>only suggested by Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Saigon would not undertake discussion such a matter
                            since this would be solely within <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            prerogatives.)</p>
                        <p>d. Conein will speak to <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>
                            alone.</p>
                        <p>e. Gen <persName corresp="#p_TTDMG1">Ton That Dinh</persName> has
                            realized he was “played for a fool” during his tenure as Military
                            Governor of Saigon. For this reason “may join our side.”</p>
                        <p>f. Gen Tran Van Kim and Gen Phan Xuan Chieu have been given staff
                            positions under Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> on the
                                <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>g. The Generals (specific personalities not identified) have requested
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to accord them
                            positions of Minister of Defense, Minister of Interior, Minister of
                            Education, Minister of Civic Action, and the Prefector of the Police for
                            Saigon/Cholon. In addition, Generals asked President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to appoint a general officer
                            Military Governor Saigon/Cholon to insure defense of area. Generals are
                            convinced <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has no intention
                            of making these appointments.</p>
                        <p>5. Conein attempted to elicit additional details from <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> who refused all attempts at
                            elicitation with statement “you must talk to <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>.” <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> did volunteer, however, that Generals “now have a
                            plan.” <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> was emphatic with
                            respect to this last statement.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> also stated that two days
                            prior to Gen <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>'s first press
                            conference (29 Aug) Vietnamese civilian otherwise unidentified visited
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>, stated that
                            Americans were contacting various Vietnamese in order to encourage a
                            coup. Thereupon <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had called in
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> was shown list of Americans engaged
                            in such coup plots. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> stated
                            Conein's name was not on this list.</p>
                        <p>7. Ambassador has approved Conein's contact with <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> on 5 October.</p>

                            trip to Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we cannot
                            stay in the middle much longer. The program outlined in his report<note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2">
                                <ref target="#d167">Document 167</ref>.</note> will push us toward a
                            reconciliation with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> or
                            toward a coup to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.
                            The program will have no major effect on the war effort for a period of
                            from two to four months. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, on the basis of conversations in Saigon, would
                            undoubtedly welcome this program as well as instructions to implement
                            it. The question still remains, however, as to what <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s bargaining position is. What
                            should <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> ask <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to do? We should draw up a list
                            for <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and have him find out
                            how many of our recommendations <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would accept. This list would include the military
                            recommendations contained in the report. As to political actions, there
                            are several things we want <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            to do which we think would halt the erosion of public support of the
                            government, and, hence, the resulting effect on the war effort in
                            Vietnam. One of the important actions would be to reopen Saigon
                            University after conversations with the school authorities. The purpose
                            would be to reassure the students that they need not fear arrest. In
                            return, they would not carry out further riots in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that if we go down
                            this road it will become known that we are using our aid as pressure on
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. What position will we
                            be in if we cut off aid, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            does not do what we want him to do, and then we face a decision to
                            resume aid because, if we do not, the effort against the Viet Cong will
                            cease?</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> believed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would respond to our
                            pressure by moving part way toward a position which will improve the
                            political situation in Vietnam and therefore improve the military
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>The group agreed that Administrator <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> should tell
                            Congress that we are not suspending aid but were putting <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> on a shorter leash which would
                            mean that we have greater flexibility to deal with the developing

                        <p>The ultimate objectives of the United States in Viet Nam do not coincide
                            with the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> objectives. We wish to defeat Viet
                            Cong subversion so that South Viet Nam may develop as a free state. They
                            wish to defeat Viet Cong subversion so that Viet Nam can develop as a
                            totalitarian state, which, in <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s words, will “challenge the communists on their own
                            grounds using their own methods”. I believe such an effort will fail and
                            will result in a communist victory in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The question is not, therefore, whether we can win with this regime but
                            rather whether we want this regime to have the benefits of such a
                            victory for purposes which are contrary not only to our objectives but
                            also to our interests. The fact is that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is exploiting two principal elements of power to
                            produce his totalitarian state. The first is the Vietnamese
                            Establishment—that educated, propertied, leadership class which makes up
                            the military officer class, the bureaucracy and the Vietnamese portion
                            of the business community—the second is the military power of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0384"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> will disestablish the first
                            element by liquidation when he feels he has achieved enough success in
                            the fight against the Viet Cong and the establishment of a peasant power
                            base. He will eject the second by a deal with North Vietnam when he
                            feels he has adequate means to continue in power without its
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>At the current moment, therefore, our situation equates with the
                            thoroughly discontented Establishment, and their ultimate goals more
                            closely coincide with ours than do those of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> regime. I conclude therefore that it is in our
                            interest to make common cause with them to overthrow the current
                            regime.</p>

                            criticisms. Those voiced were:</p>
                        <p>a. The supporting analysts,<note n="4" xml:id="d174fn4">
                                <ref target="#d175">Document 175</ref>.</note> which appeared in the
                            preceding paper, was desirable and should be integrated into the current
                            draft.</p>
                        <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0385"/>
                        <p>b. It should be made clear that the instructions involved had their
                            origin with the President.</p>
                        <p>c. The theme should be molded into the paper that the dialogue between
                            the Ambassador and President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is designed to achieve three things—an increase in
                            the military effort, a reduction in the strains on U.S./<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> confidence, and increase of popular
                            Vietnamese support for winning the war.</p>
                        <p>Based on the foregoing, minor editorial changes were suggested.</p>
                        <p>3. The principal discussion centered around how the Ambassador was to
                            convey to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> the U.S.
                            purposes, how the matter was to be explained to the U.S. public and what
                            effect the suspension of aid would actually have.</p>
                        <p>4. It was the Attorney General's view that we are so deeply committed to
                            the support of the effort in Vietnam that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will not be greatly influenced by the steps
                            contemplated in this program. He was likewise concerned with the
                            proposed technique of making the aid suspension known to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> by indirection, rather than by
                            direct confrontation. He also raised the question of the logic of making
                            known the plan to withdraw U.S. soldiers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> rationalized this course of
                            action to him in terms of there being no wisdom in leaving our forces in
                            Vietnam, when their presence is no longer required, either by virtue of
                            the Vietnamese having been trained to assume the function, or the
                            function having been fulfilled.</p>
                        <p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> was against use of the
                            word “suspend” in discussion of aid and preferred to use the term “held
                            up” to indicate that it might be resumed. He also proposed, in the
                            anticipation that the President would have to make some form of public
                            statement, that it should be pivoted upon the theme that the programs
                            which are held up are being reviewed to insure that they are consistent
                            with the President's previously announced policy regarding assistance
                            for Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>6. There was discussion of the desirability of increasing <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts, particularly with respect
                            to the emphasis on democracy, freedom and enlightened processes. It was
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s view that we
                            should be wary of this action because it might inspire <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to eject the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, which would be disastrous.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> recommended that at
                            tomorrow's White House meeting the Conclusions and Recommendations in
                            the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> report be reviewed in the
                            presence of the President, along with the analysis of alternative
                            policies (Section IX). At that meeting, also, there will be a further
                            redraft of the paper on economics and politics, embodying the minor
                            changes suggested today.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi>: The recommended US actions are
                            designed to indicate to the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            Government our displeasure at its political actions and to create
                            significant uncertainty in that government and in key Vietnamese groups
                            as to the future intentions of the US. At the same time, the actions are
                            designed to have at most slight impact on the military or
                            counterinsurgency effort against the Viet Cong, at least in the short
                            term. The analysis of each action from this standpoint is as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Commodity Import Program</hi>.
                            Present planning envisages a range of $80-95 million of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> commodity imports, funded under the FY
                            1964 Supporting Assistance portion of the foreign aid appropriation and
                            applicable to the CY 1964 budgetary and commodity needs of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. An allotment of $28 million for the
                            first quarter of FY 1964 has already been made, and $13 million of this
                            committed and expended, with the balance of $5 million allotted but
                            frozen in Saigon. A second quarter allotment of $20-25 million would now
                            normally be due. The recommendation would continue to freeze the present
                            $5 million and would withhold the second quarter allotment.</p>
                        <p>The material effect of this action must be considered from two
                            standpoints:</p>
                        <p>a. Commodity imports are handled through commercial channels and the
                            proceeds in piastres then become available to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, 15% at the time of licensing,
                            approximately 80% three months later at the time of shipment, and the
                            balance through tax receipts upon arrival. The shortfall in piastre flow
                            from receipts at the time of licensing is sufficiently small to be
                            within the normal swing of the account, and would have no serious effect
                            on piastre availability for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            budget, the deficiency being met by small borrowings from the Central
                            Bank. However, the effect on piastre availability would become
                            substantial in 3-4 months, in amounts that could be met over an
                            additional short period by larger scale borrowings but that would be
                            cumulatively serious in producing a budget pinch in the early months of
                            1964, and might cause the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to cut
                            expenses even sooner. It should be noted that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> budget for 1964 is already tight even
                            on the <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0387"/>assumption that $95
                            million of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> commodity imports would
                            be available, and it is now uncertain whether the foreign aid final
                            appropriation would permit the $95 million level.</p>
                        <p>b. The effect on the flow of commodities into Vietnam would not be
                            serious in the short term, inasmuch as $70-80 million of previous
                            US-funded commodity imports as well as substantial private imports are
                            in the pipeline. A valley would, however, begin to appear about March
                            1964.</p>
                        <p>Psychologically, a major problem might arise as the mere decision to
                            suspend becomes more fully known in Saigon official and business
                            circles. The freezing of the $5 million is already known, and the timing
                            pattern of allotment decisions is also familiar. Hence, it must be
                            expected that this too would become rapidly known. The resulting
                            uncertainty might cause a substantial wave of speculation or hoarding.
                            Moreover, retaliatory or compensatory action by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> might accelerate the process. Our
                            tentative judgment is that inflation would start to become a substantial
                            danger in 2-4 months, but the situation would require the closest
                            possible scrutiny. We should be prepared to live with a modest degree of
                            inflation, but anything major would be cause for concern. It should be
                            noted, however, that the inflationary effect would probably be felt
                            principally in the affected commodities and not, for example, in the
                            basic price of rice for the people, which is under tight <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control. Inflation would hit Saigon
                            initially, and would be slow to reach the countryside. Its greatest
                            early impact on the military effort would be through raising the already
                            tight <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> budget to levels even more
                            unlikely to be attained by any measure the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could be induced or pressured to take. Since 1/2 the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> budget goes to the military
                            effort, shortfalls might be reflected in some measure of force
                            reductions and probably in reductions in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s contribution to such key elements as the strategic
                            hamlet program.</p>
                        <p>This action is not readily reversible. Since commodity imports move
                            through commercial channels, they could not be later speeded up to avoid
                            the impending valley. Nonetheless, a firm later decision to resume
                            either at present full planning rates or at a more austere rate designed
                            to keep some pressure on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would
                            tend to reduce the adverse effects.</p>
                        <p>Within 2-4 months, and perhaps sooner, a decision would have to be made
                            whether to continue suspension and incur substantial effects on the
                            military effort, or to resume either at the full level or at an
                            intermediate austere level.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 items. Although the PL 480
                            mechanics are the same as for <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            commodity imports, it should be noted that the specific items are in
                            some cases more sensitive from the standpoint of popular blame to the
                            U.S. in the countryside. Moreover, from the U.S. budgetary standpoint,
                            PL 480 funds are more readily available than <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> funds <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0388"/>and for
                            this reason have been built up to the maximum consistent with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> capacity to absorb; withholding PL 480
                            items must be weighed carefully if the economic effect is such as to
                            require additional input in <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> funds at
                            a later time.</p>
                        <p>The only presently pending PL 480 item is $2.9 million of condensed milk.
                            Much of this goes to the countryside, and its cut-off would be felt
                            widely and might be blamed directly on the U.S. For this reason we do
                            not recommend suspension of this item, nor, for lack of an appropriate
                            mechanism, do we believe it should be shifted to direct grant channels
                            under Title II. Instead, we believe it can make a modest contribution to
                            the desired picture of uncertainty of being placed on a month-by-month
                            basis rather than being negotiated on the normal basis of an agreement
                            covering several months.</p>
                        <p>The next items requiring decision will be wheat flour ($6 million) and
                            raw cotton ($12 million) both of which would start to run short unless
                            supplementary agreements were negotiated about 1 November. We reserve a
                            recommendation on these.</p>
                        <p>The remaining items comprise $5 million in the total PL 480 planning
                            figure of $33 million for FY 1964. These too require no immediate
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>Actions in the PL 480 field are similar to actions affecting <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> commodity imports in their
                            reversibility. Impending commodity slacks cannot be taken up by
                            accelerated action.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Project Loans. The Saigon
                            waterworks and electric power projects are now partially funded and
                            under construction, and the remaining balances are up for final
                            approval. Arrangements are so nearly final that it would be necessary to
                            inform the contractors in both cases, and we believe this should be done
                            frankly at once.</p>
                        <p>Suspension of these projects would have no direct effect whatever on the
                            military effort. However, it could add to the psychological factors
                            bearing on the likelihood of inflation, and would eventually affect
                            employment in the Saigon area.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> might well react to our
                            suspension either by applying its own resources to the projects (raising
                            a cumulative foreign exchange problem) or by turning to third countries
                            such as France. The latter would be an interesting test of the recently
                            displayed French attitude of willingness to assist, but the amounts are
                            not so great that we should be unduly concerned from this standpoint if
                            the French would come through.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Support for Colonel <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName>'s Saigon Forces.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The stated rationale for this action is that we will not support forces
                            not being used for combat purposes. The material effect of this gesture
                            would not be great, since the equipment already in the hands of these
                            units is generally adequate and the U.S. contribution to their pay is
                            small and could be made up from the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            budget. However, <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0389"/>the gesture
                            would have importance not merely as part of the picture of uncertainty,
                            but perhaps even more strongly in dissociating the U.S. from support of
                            these forces. If-as we believe likely-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> refused to accept our conditions, or proposed some
                            transparent device, we should then (unlike the other actions) make an
                            outright public announcement. The U.S. press reaction would undoubtedly
                            be most favorable, and within Soviet Vietnam both high military leaders
                            and disaffected elements in Saigon would also be favorable.</p>
                        <p>The cut-off action against Colonel <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> would be designed to be permanent and not
                            reversible, unless our conditions were met and maintained.</p>
                        <p>The recommended transfer [less than 1 line not declassified] to <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> of border surveillance and mountain
                            scout forces is desirable in its own right. Funding through FY 1964 will
                            continue to be supplied [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] under the same procedures now used for <gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss> forces.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> [less than 1 line not
                            declassified] should urgently consider whether it is wise and feasible
                            to transfer to <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> wholly or in part
                            certain [less than 1 line not declassified] activities: combat
                            intelligence teams and operations into south Laos and North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Such recommended or possible transfers [less than 1 line not
                            declassified] responsibility would result in the loss of some [less than
                            1 line not declassified] liaison connections in high military circles.
                            Hopefully, this slack could be taken up by U.S. military advisors.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Over-all Impact</hi>. As stated in the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Report, it should be emphasized that, so long as
                            the U.S. continued its principal assistance activities that contribute
                            directly to the military effort, the level of pressure on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> generated by the recommended
                            actions would probably not be high. We do believe, however, that they
                            would collectively add up to a picture of significant uncertainty, and
                            that this would extend to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            both directly and through representations by military leaders and
                            economic officials who would be aware of the potential consequences. We
                            must recognize that pressures such as these do not appear likely to get
                            rid of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, and likewise that
                            they might conceivably lead <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to some upsetting
                            action.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Need for a Working Group</hi>. Both <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reaction and the impact of these
                            actions on the military effort (notably through the inflation
                            possibility) require very close review. Hence our recommendation for a
                            working group in Washington, with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> reporting reactions

                        <p rend="center">CAVEATS TO RECOMMENDED APPROACH</p>
                        <p>It is only prudent to recognize that the course of action outlined above
                            can be substantially affected by developments beyond our control. Among
                            these might be one or more of the following:</p>
                        <p>a) Unanticipated coup d'etat (e.g. by junior officers), or death of
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>b) Other unanticipated internal developments (similar to the Hue incident
                            on May 8) which could take place in the volatile atmosphere that
                            characterizes the Vietnamese political scene. This could include a
                            marked step-up in the pace and nature of the Viet Cong effort.</p>
                        <p>c) International developments affecting the war or the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s position, e.g. active Chinese
                            Communist or Cambodian support to the Viet Cong; a UN initiative toward
                            the condemnation of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> or
                            neutralization of the area; or active and direct intervention by North
                            Vietnamese forces in Central Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>d) A posture by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> vis-a-vis the
                            United States characterized by outright and stubborn hostility to
                            “foreign interference,” accompanied by efforts to rally popular
                            xenophobia.</p>
                        <p>e) A bid by Hanoi or the National Front for a rapprochement on terms
                            attractive to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> (a contingency we believe
                            conceivable, but unlikely).</p>
                        <p>f) A situation in which the Ngos carry out the forms of change, but
                            maintain the fundamental character and image of their regime.</p>

                            Conein met with Gen. Duong Van Minh at Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>'s headquarters on Le Van Duyet for one hour and ten
                            minutes morning of 5 Oct. 1963. This meeting was at the initiative of
                            Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> and had been
                            specifically cleared in advance by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. No other persons were present.
                            The conversation was conducted in French.</p>
                        <p>2. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> stated that he must
                            know American Government's position with respect to a change in the
                            Government of Vietnam within the very near future. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> added the Generals were <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0392"/>aware the situation is
                            deteriorating rapidly and that action to change the government must be
                            taken or the war will be lost to the Viet Cong because the government no
                            longer has the support of the people. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> identified among the other Generals participating
                            with him in this plan:</p>
                        <p>Maj. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_TVDMG1">Tran Van Don</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>Brig. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_TTKG1">Tran Thien Khiem</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>Maj. Gen. Tran Van Kim</p>
                        <p>3. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> made it clear that
                            he did not expect any specific American support for an effort on the
                            part of himself and his colleagues to change the government but he
                            stated he does need American assurances that the USG will not attempt to
                            thwart this plan.</p>
                        <p>4. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> also stated that he
                            himself has no political ambitions nor do any of the other general
                            officers except perhaps, he said laughingly, Gen. <persName corresp="#p_TTDMG1">Ton That Dinh</persName>. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> insisted that his only purpose is
                            to win the war. He added emphatically that to do this, continuation of
                            American military and economic aid at the present level (he said one and
                            one half million dollars per day) is necessary.</p>
                        <p>5. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> outlined three
                            possible plans for the accomplishment of the change of government:</p>
                        <p>a. Assassination of <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>
                            and <persName>Ngo Dinh</persName> Can keeping President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in office. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> said this was the easiest plan to
                            accomplish.</p>
                        <p>b. The encirclement of Saigon by various military units particularly the
                            unit at Ben Cat. (Comment: Fifth division elements commanded by Gen.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>c. Direct confrontation between military units involved in the coup and
                            loyalist military units in Saigon, in effect, dividing the city of
                            Saigon into sectors and cleaning it out pocket by pocket. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> claims under the circumstances
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> could count on the loyalty of 5,500
                            troops within the City of Saigon.</p>
                        <p>6. Conein replied to Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>
                            that he could not answer specific question as to USG non-interference
                            nor could he give any advice with respect to tactical planning. He added
                            that he could not advise concerning the best of the three plans.</p>
                        <p>7. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> went on to explain
                            that the most dangerous men in South Vietnam are <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>, <persName>Ngo
                                Dinh</persName> Can and <persName corresp="#p_NTH1">Ngo Trong
                                Hieu</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> stated
                            that <persName corresp="#p_HIEU1">Hieu</persName> was formerly a
                            Communist and still has Communist sympathies. When Col. Conein remarked
                            that he had considered Col. <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName>
                            as one of the more dangerous individuals, Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> stated “if I get rid of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, Can and <persName corresp="#p_HIEU1">Hieu</persName>, Col. <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> will be on his knees before
                            me.”</p>
                        <p>8. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> also stated that he
                            was worried as to the role of Gen. <persName corresp="#p_TTKG1">Tran
                                Thien Khiem</persName> since <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> may have played a double role in August. Gen.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> asked that copies of
                            the documents previously <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0393"/>passed
                            to Gen. <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> (plan of Camp
                            Long Thanh and munitions inventory at that camp) be passed to Gen.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> personally for
                            comparison with papers passed by <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>
                            purportedly from <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> further stated that one
                            of the reasons they are having to act quickly was the fact that many
                            regimental, battalion and company commanders are working on coup plans
                            of their own which could be abortive and a “catastrophe”.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> appeared to understand
                            Conein's position of being unable to comment at the present moment but
                            asked that Conein again meet with Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> to discuss the specific plan of operations which
                            Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> hopes to put into
                            action. No specific date was given for this next meeting. Conein was
                            again non-committal in his reply. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> once again indicated his understanding and stated
                            that he would arrange to contact Conein in the near future and hoped
                            that Conein would be able to meet with him again and give the assurance
                            outlined above.</p>

                        <p>1. Assure him that US will not attempt to thwart his plans.</p>
                        <p>2. Offer to view his plans, other than assassination plans.</p>
                        <p>3. Assure <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> that US aid will
                            be continued to Vietnam under government which gives promise of gaining
                            support of people and winning the war against the Communists. Point out
                            that it is our view that this is most likely to be the case if
                            government includes good proportion of well qualified civilian leaders
                            in key positions. (Conein should press <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> for details his thinking re composition future

                                that he had obtained <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s clearance and agreed with <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> that no copies should be

                        <p>A conference on South Vietnam was held in the Cabinet Room at 9:30 a.m.,
                            October 5, 1963. Present were the Vice President, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, Administrator <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName>, Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The meeting discussed the report of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and considered draft
                            instructions to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what would be the impact of a suspension of the
                            Commodity Import Program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> replied that the Commodity Import Program accounted
                            for approximately 40 percent of South Vietnam's imports. He emphasized
                            that the real effect of a suspension would be an interruption of the
                            flow of commodities into the country. A suspension would not necessarily
                            have an impact upon the government budget. A continued suspension,
                            however, would have a serious effect on the economy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said that he believed
                            that the principal effect of a suspension would be to cause an economic
                            crisis in the Saigon business community. This would be more pronounced
                            than the political effects such a suspension might have upon <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0395"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out
                            that since we have already suspended the funding of imports under the
                            program, it would be difficult to resume now.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed and asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> what would be the impact of a suspension of the two
                            capital projects, the Saigon water works and the Saigon power
                            project.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> replied that a suspension
                            of these projects would not have an effect upon the economy or upon the
                            military effort. But, he pointed out, both projects were already started
                            and near their final stages of completion. The water project was
                            complete except for the construction of a filtration plant; and the
                            power station needed only a building to house the turbines, which had
                            already been ordered. The President suggested that the contractors in
                            each case simply be told that a decision on the final stages of the two
                            projects would be delayed for policy reasons for an indefinite, but not
                            necessarily long, period of time. Our public posture should be that the
                            two projects were being suspended for further review.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that the recommendations with respect to the PL 480
                            program were tantamount to taking no substantive action at this time. In
                            this connection he suggested that, for the present, we say only that we
                            were not in a position to make forward decisions.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then fumed to recommendations concerning a suspension of
                            assistance to those forces under Colonel <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> which were located in Saigon rather than in the
                            field. The President emphasized that we should make clear the basis upon
                            which we were suspending aid to these forces, i.e. that they were not
                            directly contributing to the war effort and therefore we could not
                            support them.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> for his opinion on the nature of the
                            controversy between the Buddhists and the Government. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that in his
                            opinion the controversy was now more political than it was
                            religious.</p>
                        <p>After a discussion with General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, the President observed that the military
                            improvements which we wished to press upon <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> be taken up as soon as possible by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> rather than by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. It would be
                            preferable if discussions of political improvements and possible U.S.
                            pressure actions were undertaken by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. The President also said that we
                            should not consider the political recommendations to be in the nature of
                            a hard and fast list of demands, and that this point should be made more
                            clear in the draft instructions. <note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">The
                                changes made in the draft at the instruction of President are
                                explained in the footnotes to <ref target="#d181">Document
                                181</ref>. See also <ref target="#d180">Document 180</ref>. </note>
                            The most likely and desirable result of any U.S. pressures would be to
                            bring <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to talk seriously to
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> about the whole range
                            of issues between us.</p>
                        <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0396"/>
                        <p>The Secretary of State agreed that the military matters should be pressed
                            and that they stood the best chance of being accepted by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Nevertheless, he felt that we should
                            not forget the importance of obtaining an improvement in the political
                            climate in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>The President said that no formal or public statement should be made at
                            the conclusion of the meeting. Instead he felt that the Secretaries of
                            State and Defense in executive session before Congressional committees
                            next week should confine themselves to saying that U.S. programs were
                            under continuing review in light of the President's previously announced
                            policy that we supported those things which furthered the war effort and
                            would not support those things which do not.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that Section 5 of the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            Report be approved and that appropriate instructions implementing the
                            recommendation in this section be transmitted via <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> channels. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said that any such activity
                            should be carried on under the tightest security under the direction of
                            the <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> station chief. The President
                            agreed, but added that these activities should be subject to the
                            Ambassador's general guidance.</p>
                        <p>The President also said that our decision to remove 1,000 U.S. advisors
                            by December of this year should not be raised formally with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. Instead the action should be
                            carried out routinely as part of our general posture of withdrawing
                            people when they are no longer needed.</p>

                        <p>He thinks it of the greatest importance that, to the very limit of our
                            abilities, we should not open this next stage in the press. The
                            decisions and instructions in following telegram are being held most
                            tightly here, and we are making every possible effort to limit public
                            knowledge and to let the Vietnamese Government itself learn from what we
                            do and not what the papers say, so that your negotiations with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> may be run on your terms. Nothing
                            could be more dangerous than an impression now that a set of major
                            actions is being kicked off and a set of requirements imposed on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> by U.S. This is of particular
                            importance since some officials and reporters honorably believe in just
                            such a public posture of disapproval and pressure. President therefore
                            believes you should personally control knowledge of individual actions
                            and of tactics, and accept, as we will try to, necessary dissatisfaction
                            of determined reporters with cryptic posture.</p>

                        <p>1. Following is overall instruction resulting from <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> consideration of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> report and recommendations together with those
                            you have submitted in recent weeks. These instructions have the
                            President's personal approval. At any time you feel it is necessary you
                            may state to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that you are acting
                            under the specific instructions of the President as recommended by the
                            National Security Council.</p>
                        <p>2. Actions are designed to indicate to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government our displeasure at its political
                            policies and activities and to create significant uncertainty in that
                            government and in key Vietnamese groups as to future intentions of
                            United States. At same time, actions are designed to have at most slight
                            impact on military or counterinsurgency effort against Viet Cong, at
                            least in short term.</p>
                        <p>3. The recommendations on negotiations are concerned with what US is
                            after, i.e., <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> action to increase
                            effectiveness of its military effort; to ensure popular support to win
                            war; and to eliminate strains on US Government and public confidence.
                            The negotiating posture is designed not to lay down specific hard and
                            fast demands or to set a deadline, but to produce movement in Vietnamese
                            Government along these lines. In this way we can test and probe
                            effectiveness of any actions the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            actually takes and, at same time, maintain sufficient flexibility to
                            permit US to resume full support of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime at any time US Government deems it
                            appropriate.</p>
                        <p>4. We recognize that recommended actions cannot be continued more than a
                            limited period—tentatively estimated at two to four months—before they
                            begin to have substantial impact on counterinsurgency effort. Even
                            within this period, they will require careful and constant evaluation.
                            As they begin to have substantial impact on war effort, further major
                            decisions will be needed.</p>
                        <p>5. It is not possible to specify with precision the criteria that we
                            should use in determining whether this proposed course of action has
                            brought about adequate changes in performance of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government and should, therefore,
                            be modified or withdrawn, or whether on contrary response of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government is clearly
                            inadequate so that more drastic action should be considered. The desired
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> measures in this report are
                            grouped under three headings: (1) military actions, (2) political
                            actions, and (3) actions with respect to US itself. Test of adequacy of
                            these actions should be whether, in combination, they improve
                            effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> effort to point
                            where we can carry on in confident expectation that war effort will
                            progress satisfactorily. Since we cannot now foresee interlocking impact
                            of possible actions both in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and
                            here, we obviously do not expect that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will or even can perform on entire list and for this
                            reason this is in no sense a package of demands. While general view here
                            is that some action in each of three areas will be necessary, we do not
                            now wish to prejudge question <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0399"/>of balance or quantity of actions which may justify resumption of full

                        <p>No public announcement will be made. In addition, US working levels
                            should inform Vietnamese military that commodity import assumptions
                            being used for budget planning purposes must now be considered uncertain
                            not only from previously stated standpoint of Congressional uncertainty,
                            but because of executive review of program.</p>
                        <p>7. PL 480. Presently pending supplementary agreement for $2.9 million

                            annually) approximately 1 November, and these items will then be
                            submitted for action by Washington. Remainder of presently planned PL
                            480 for FY 1964, comprising tobacco ($2.5 million) and miscellaneous
                            items ($2.5 million), does not require any action in next 60 days.

                            that is vital for victory. The third is crisis of confidence on the part
                            of the American public and Government. Heart of problem is form of
                            government that has been evolving in Viet-Nam. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s regime has trappings of
                            democracy, but in reality it has been evolving into authoritarian
                            government maintained by police terrorist methods. What <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> must do is to reverse this process of
                            evolution.</p>
                        <p>13. To preserve flexibility and provide an opportunity for testing and
                            probing on effectiveness of measures <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            actually takes, you should avoid laying down specific demands, but
                            consider actions listed below as illustrative examples of general
                            proposition outlined above, picking and choosing particular items as
                            situation warrants.</p>
                        <p>14. Purpose of all actions listed below is to increase effectiveness of
                            war effort, to ensure popular support, and to relieve strains in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/US relations.</p>

                        <p>15. Specific military actions listed below are probably most acceptable
                            to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, but serve as a test of
                            his commitment to furthering war effort. They should increase
                            effectiveness of war effort and this in turn should feed back to improve
                            political climate. We believe that burden of pressure for military
                            actions should be assumed by General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> in direct conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and others under your general
                            guidance and that these conversations should not await initiative by
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, since our continuing
                            posture of cooperative consultation on military matters should not be
                            broken. Conversely, <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            should not be channel of a discussion on relation between improvements
                            by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and resumption of full US
                            support. <note n="5" xml:id="d181fn5">The last two sentences of

                            political actions, i.e., entering into negotiations to normalize
                            university life, etc., should set stage for later political actions,
                            such as broadening government.</p>
                        <p>17. If, in fact, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> does begin to move
                            along lines we desire, an opportunity will be provided to test and probe
                            effectiveness of the actions in improving war effort, ensuring popular
                            support, and easing strain in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/US
                            relations. Paramount need, however, is for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to set a psychological tone and image that will make
                            specific actions both real and credible. Although we cannot at this time
                            in complete confidence predict the exact point in this complex of
                            actions at which we will be sure war effort will proceed to successful
                            conclusion, it seems probable its achievement will require some
                            restriction of role of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>s. As
                            practical matter, we would expect that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would not take such action at outset, but only
                            after he had proceeded a considerable distance down the path we
                            desire.</p>

                            conditions of normalization of university life. Since students are
                            fearful of arrests and inclined to riots, this will involve significant
                            negotiations on a variety of police-terrorist techniques, including
                            secret arrests, torture, beatings, etc. For this reason, it is an
                            excellent technique to get <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            to focus on the core issues. Similar action should be taken in regard to

                            construed as a package of US demands. We believe it of great importance
                            that there should be no public impression of a package of sanctions and
                            a package of demands. We are seeking necessary but limited improvements
                            from a government very difficult to move, and we do not wish to
                            encourage unjustified sense of optimism or of triumph from those who
                            wish this situation was easier than it is. In particular, we would
                            prefer press to consider us inactive than to trumpet a posture of “major
                            sanctions” and “sweeping demands.” (You should follow same line in

                            approved recommendation that no initiative should now be taken to give
                            any active covert encouragement to a coup. There should, however, be
                            urgent covert effort with closest security under broad guidance of
                            Ambassador to identify and build contacts with possible alternative
                            leadership as and when it appears. Essential that this effort be totally
                            secure and fully deniable and separated entirely from normal political
                            analysis and reporting and other activities of country team. We repeat
                            that this effort is not to be aimed at active promotion of coup but only
                            at surveillance and readiness. In order to provide plausibility to
                            denial suggest you and no one else in Embassy issue these instructions
                            orally to Acting Station Chief and hold him responsible to you alone for
                            making appropriate contacts and reporting to you alone.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has asked me
                            to examine the nature and the cause of differing opinions and attitudes
                            in the official US community in Vietnam. Specifically, he is concerned
                            with the divergent evaluations of the success which we are having in
                            “winning the war against the Viet Cong.”</p>
                        <p>I have talked with various members of the official community and have, in
                            general, covered the same ground with each element of the Country Team.
                            My first observation is that there are divergencies but that they do not
                            divide cleanly and sharply along Service and Department lines. Within
                            each of the elements of the Team, there are individuals who hold views
                            more or less at variance with the majority of others in their element.
                            However, insofar as any general watershed of opinion can be detected, it
                            finds the civilian components of the Country Team on one hand and the
                            military components on the other.</p>
                        <p>In approaching the views of these two general communities or the basic
                            question of “winning the war”, I soon became aware that, in their
                            answers, they were addressing themselves fundamentally to two different
                            questions. The military directed themselves primarily to the more
                            active, physical task of counterinsurgency, i.e., conducting clear and
                            hold operations, building strategic hamlets, isolating the population
                            from the Viet Cong, organizing protection for the cleared areas, and
                            prodding the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> into search and
                            destroy actions against Viet Cong strongholds.</p>
                        <p>The civilians, on the other hand, directed themselves more to the
                            psychological aspects of the problem. They were concerned less with the
                            physical task of eliminating Viet Cong operations and more with the job
                            of eliminating those mental attitudes among the population which made
                            the people receptive and susceptible to the subversive and propaganda
                            activities of the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0407"/>
                        <p>Moreover, the military are oriented towards a specific mission which they
                            are undertaking. They feel a justifiable sense of accomplishment in the
                            results they have achieved to date. They can measure the indices of
                            their progress and have a “can-do”, “gung-ho” sense of confidence in
                            their ability to complete their mission.</p>
                        <p>The civilians, on the other hand (with the exception of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>), are oriented towards a more passive
                            and more frustrating task of attempting to dissuade an oriental regime
                            from its method of governing and to persuade it to use other methods
                            which involve more empathy towards the popular mind. They constantly
                            watch the Government, despite their urgings, throw away opportunities to
                            gain greater popular acceptance. They feel that each of these occasions
                            gives new advantages to the Viet Cong and that each constitutes a step
                            backward in the psychological battle. They do not, in general, discount
                            the physical progress that has been made in the counterinsurgency
                            effort, but they are inclined to question the quality of its efforts in
                            the light of the Government's political ineptness.</p>
                        <p>Hence, the military and the civilian components of the Country Team
                            approach the same set of data from different perspectives. They fall
                            almost inevitably into the classic postures of the two men who look at
                            the same glass of water—one sees it half full, the other sees it half
                            empty. This difference in perspective is then magnified by the
                            imprecision of the data examined. All honest US observers admit that
                            there are great margins of tolerance and doubt in the statistics on
                            which they base their conclusions. Therefore, there is an opportunity
                            for a great deal of subjective interpretation in deriving a conclusion
                            from a given set of “facts”.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, and compounding this essential occasion for divergence, there
                            enters into the picture a considerable emotional element. On the
                            military side, this takes the form of professional or service pride. Any
                            suggestion that success is not being attained is considered a personal
                            affront, a reflection impugning the achievements of the US armed forces.
                            On the civilian side, any effort by the military to reach essentially
                            political or intelligence conclusions is considered an incursion into or
                            even the pre-emption of a field of activity which should be properly
                            civilian.</p>
                        <p>Finally, and as the ultimate fillings to the emotional charge, is the
                            simple problem of the pecking order. When I came here a year ago with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, it was my
                            observation that the “top banana” in the US official community was
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>. This was
                            understandable, not only was he a senior officer in the Army, but he was
                            a man with a considerable reputation and experience. He disposed of
                            infinitely more resources than the Ambassador and he had a far more
                            impressive establishment responsive to his direct command. Moreover, he
                            and his command represented the new and the current thrust <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0408"/>of highest level US policy interest in
                            Vietnam. He was the executor of the main US drive of the day in which
                            there was invested a great measure of US prestige.</p>
                        <p>Fritz <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>, on the other hand,
                            was a fairly junior US Foreign Service Officer of no particular
                            international reputation and prestige. He was undertaking his first
                            assignment as an Ambassador in a part of the world in which he had no
                            depth of experience. He had very limited resources at his direct
                            disposal and a relatively small staff. He knew and understood the
                            direction and the design of top-level US policy. With good common sense
                            and discretion, Fritz “got on the team” and made no contest to assume a
                            prerogative of control. This does not suggest that he was a doormat; it
                            merely means that he chose what he quite sensibly considered to be the
                            most effective way to exercise his talents and to utilize his
                            resources.</p>
                        <p>This arrangement caused some grumbling in the civilian side of the
                            Country Team. As disciplined professionals, they buckled down and did
                            their part in contributing to the US operational effort. However, they
                            had a number of nagging doubts about the qualitative effect of the
                            effort in which they were engaged. A number of them expressed these
                            doubts to me privately when I was here. When I suggested that they
                            report them officially through regular channels, I was later advised
                            that most of their critical analysis was moderated before being sent or
                            else was not finally sent on to Washington.</p>
                        <p>As a result of this situation, a certain head of emotional pressure built
                            up in the Embassy which finally erupted into the open after Fritz went
                            on home leave and while <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName>
                            was in charge. Once again, this was brought in check upon Fritz's return
                            to duty here.</p>
                        <p>Finally, when Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            arrived on the scene, two things happened. First, he was a man of
                            international political stature, considerable experience as an
                            Ambassador and the bearer of Presidential assurances that he was, and
                            should act as US “top banana” in Vietnam. This change of style was
                            immediately apparent to everyone in the official US community and has
                            had the usual intangible effects which go with such changeovers. Second,
                            he has come to the conclusion that the “doubting Thomases” in the
                            civilian component, those who hold the “we cannot win with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>” attitude are correct. This, in
                            turn, has had its predictable and largely intangible consequences in the
                            emotional quotient of the problem.</p>
                        <p>Finally, however, I believe a word of evaluation is necessary with
                            respect to current attitudes among the diverging components. With very
                            rare exceptions, there is no bitterness. The period of operational
                            harmony built up in the <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>
                            period has resulted in some very close friendships and good working
                            relations across the board. The dedication of all sequents [segments?]
                            of the Team to make the program succeed is great enough and the men
                            involved are mature enough to <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0409"/>be submerged in hard work. On operational problems, there is no
                            impairment of effectiveness discernible as yet. All officers I have
                            talked to show a genuine concern that this situation will continue
                            without change no matter what the more introspective differences may
                            bring in the way of divergencies.</p>

                        <p>2. I will of course comply in every particular in not opening our work to
                            the press—a policy in which I deeply believe. I will personally control
                            knowledge of future cables, limiting them to <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>, to personal assistant, myself, and the rather large
                            number of clerks and communications people who under our system must be
                            in the know. I will not even bring in the Chief of the Political Section
                            unless absolutely necessary. Of course <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Smith</persName> will have to control
                            their own offices and I am cautioning them. It is indeed most desirable
                            to confront the Government of Viet-Nam with deeds rather than words,
                            which are of little use, and I will certainly accept whatever
                            dissatisfaction all this causes to reporters.</p>
                        <p>3. I would like to explain certain features of the press situation here
                            concerning which helpful action might be taken in Washington, as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Some agencies here have much better press relations than others. For
                            example, <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>, which should have no press
                            relations at all, has the worst, and this raises questions as to whether
                            it is properly organized. I say this without prejudice to anyone, least
                            of all anyone in <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> here. But a
                            situation has arisen, doubtless brought about by the course of events,
                            which requires attention.</p>
                        <p>b. Reporters here have unlimited ways of getting material in this city,
                            which contains thousands of loquacious Americans. For example, last
                            night <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Sheehan</persName> of <gloss target="#t_UPI1">UPI</gloss> called several Embassy officers
                            regarding departure of <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Station Chief
                            and was told nothing. At this writing (Sunday noon, Saigon) I know
                            nothing of what is in U.S. press. Yet I would bet that <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Sheehan</persName> found someone who informed him
                            and that word of <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Station Chief's
                            departure is in print in U.S.<note n="3" xml:id="d185fn3">According to

                        <p>c. One thing is certain: reporters here will write something every day.
                            If U.S. Government gives nothing, they will work something up somehow. I
                            wish I thought that it was possible for General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> to organize an extensive program to familiarize the
                            press <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0411"/>with interesting military
                            and social economic programs in the countryside. But I believe that this
                            would at most create one story and that they would all be back trying to
                            ferret out the big story.</p>

                        <p>2. Language in paragraphs 17 and 19-h on “restriction on role of Nhus”
                            seems unrealistic for these reasons:</p>
                        <p>a. On basis of my present knowledge, it is clear that U.S. has provided
                            the weapons, training and money to enable <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to have in effect adequate army of his own,
                            consisting of men who are carefully selected, intensely indoctrinal
                            [indoctrinated] and well paid. For its size, it is a formidable force
                            and man for man appears to have a big edge over an ordinary military
                            outfit. For some inexplicable reason, we appear to have done all this
                            without our having any effective strings whatever on the use of this
                            force. Our only possible leverage would be cutting off funds, but it is
                            hard to believe that this would be effective.</p>

                                of State, Vietnam Working Group Files: Lot 67 D 54, Honolulu
                                Conference, Nov. 20, 1963)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> says in effect that he can
                            and would like to get along without the Americans. He only wants some
                            helicopter units and some money. But he definitely does not want
                            American military personnel who, he says, are absolutely incapable of
                            fighting a guerrilla war. Even the Special Forces created by Kennedy are
                            not worth anything. He wants Viet-Nam to be treated as U.S. treats
                            Yugoslavia—giving them money but not seeking to influence their system
                            of government. He says that he and the President were against massive
                            American intervention even at “the time of greatest danger, that is, the
                            winter of 1961-1962”. The war cannot be won with the Americans because
                            they are an obstacle to <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0412"/>the
                            revolutionary transformation of society which is the prerequisite of
                            victory. Then come these words: “If the Americans were to interrupt
                            their help, it may not be a bad thing after all.” He said that if his
                            father-in-law, former Ambassador Chnong, were to “come to Saigon, I will
                            have his head cut off. I will hang him in the center of a square and let
                            him dangle there. My wife will make the knot on the rope because she is
                            proud of being a Vietnamese and she is a good patriot.”</p>
                        <p>c. Within the last few days the Minister of Civic Action <persName corresp="#p_HIEU1">Hieu</persName> said to one of my (very few,
                            alas!) highly reliable sources: “We don't need the Americans any more
                            even in the economic field, as we can confront our economic problems
                            with our own resources.” Present suspension of Commodity Import Program
                            may give GVN a chance to decide whether Hieu is right.</p>
                        <p>d. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in his message to the
                            National Assembly today, speaking of the forthcoming victory over the
                            Viet Cong, says that it will “show the small countries of the
                            non-aligned world (tiers monde) that they too can strangle Communist
                            subversive war.” He also singled out the World Assembly of the
                            Interparliamentary Union (scene of Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s activity) as the place where Viet-Nam, on the
                            international field, has played a notable role.</p>
                        <p>3. The above leads me to the conclusion that we cannot remove the Nhus by
                            non-violent means against their will.</p>
                        <p>4. I also conclude that we cannot assume that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> have the same aims as we. Clearly <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> wants our help without our presence
                            which, in his view, we use as an excuse for interfering in their
                            internal system of government. Get us out, he argues, and he can be as
                            free to do as he wants as Tito is now. And <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is a strong influence on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5. Paragraphs 3 and 4 make it hard to see today a good future for the
                                U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> relationship. I say this
                            because the only thing which the U.S. really wants-the removal of or
                            restriction on the Nhus—is out of the question. Yet, none of the points
                            19 a-i look really important.</p>
                        <p>6. I believe Diem and Nhu see U.S. pressing for things such as removal of
                            Nhus, release of students which they are absolutely sure they cannot
                            give and that we should consider a request to withdraw as a growing
                            possibility. The beginning of withdrawal might trigger off a coup.</p>

                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Vietnam</hi>. Everyone is bracing for <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>'s visit. Forrestal remarked
                            Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has great attractive
                            powers; even <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> is weakening
                            and agrees some of the things she says make sense. On Vietnam in
                            general, Bundy commented that he was surprised that some people were
                            taking as “pollyanna-ish” the “<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>”
                            statement that we could pull out of Vietnam in two years.<note n="2" xml:id="d187fn2">See <ref target="#d170">Document 170</ref>.</note>
                            He said what struck him was that two years was really a long time,
                            considering that by then the war would have lasted four years—or longer
                            than most wars in US history. General <persName corresp="#p_CMGCV1">Clifton</persName> said the President undoubtedly would be asked
                            about it Wednesday at his press conference.<note n="3" xml:id="d187fn3">The President was asked questions on Vietnam at his October 9 press
                                conference, but not specifically about the 2-year projected time
                                span for American disengagement from Vietnam. For the transcript of
                                the conference, see Public Papers of the Presidents of the United

                            assembled.) The general line will be that in two years the Vietnamese
                            will be able to finish the job without US military forces on the scene—a
                            position considered reasonable by everyone around the table.</p>

                            <persName>Bundy</persName> also asked <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> to draw together the recent materials on
                            Vietnam and issue an appropriate <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss>.
                            He said that the New York Times had the only version of what was decided
                            at a recent <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting, and while he
                            did not mind communicating with various agencies through the Times,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> had suggested the
                            need for something more official.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>In response to an earlier question by the Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">M. Couve de Murville</persName> briefly discussed
                            Laos and Vietnam. Vietnam was the key because there would be no trouble
                            in Laos were it not for North Vietnamese activities. <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">M. Couve de Murville</persName> said that he
                            understood that the Secretary had earlier been interested in what
                            information the French had from North Vietnam. Actually, the French had
                            very little information. Chinese influence there undoubtedly had
                            increased. <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> remained
                            basically anti-Chinese but many of the newer ministers belonged to the
                            pro-Chinese faction. The economic situation was rather bad, but the
                            regime remained strong politically. In view of the increased Chinese
                            role, it therefore seemed likely that the U.S. in Vietnam would
                            gradually come increasingly face to face with the Chinese. The French
                            had made this experience in the past and had found it necessary to reach
                            most of the major agreements on Vietnam with the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that if the Chinese and the North Vietnamese would
                            leave South Vietnam alone, our troops could be withdrawn. This was,
                            however, not the case. The Secretary said that an error had perhaps been
                            made in the past when insufficient attention had been paid to the joint
                            strategic evaluation of the key importance of the Red River Valley.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">M. Couve de Murville</persName> said that
                            the destiny of Vietnam was to be neutral. Such a solution might come
                            about in the long run. The problem was how to get rid of the communist
                            regime in North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed. He said that North Vietnam was now taking the
                            position that a settlement would require changes in the regime in South
                            Vietnam but none in the North. <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">M. Couve de
                                Murville</persName> said <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0415"/>that this was obviously an unrealistic position. Perhaps the increased
                            dependence of North Vietnam on Communist China might in the long run
                            provide some hope for the formation of a government of national union.
                            The population in North Vietnam remained strongly anti-Chinese.</p>

                        <p>He [the President] said he thought that we were quite close on Laos, but
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s statement on
                            Vietnam had been unhelpful, particularly with regard to its timing. The
                            Foreign Minister said that it had not been General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s intention to do anything
                            unhelpful. France had been in a position at the time when she had to say
                            something. France had never had very good relations with the Diem
                            Government. There was a French interest in developing economic and
                            cultural, rather than political, relations. He felt that in the long
                            run, evolution seemed to lead in the direction of the unification and
                            neutrality of Vietnam. He said that he was aware that the statement had
                            been badly received in Washington, but it had been no better received in
                            Moscow or Peiping. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            repeated that the timing had been unfortunate. The Foreign Minister said
                            he did not know what the real situation was in Vietnam. The President
                            said he thought it was being made to appear worse than it is. The
                            Foreign Minister said France had been in Indochina during a period of
                            some ninety years and her experience had always been that any problems
                            must be discussed with the Chinese. He thought that this held true today
                            also. He said the Russians were out of Vietnam and Southeast Asia in
                            general <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0416"/>and that they have
                            almost no influence there. He said they were in roughly the same
                            position as the UK: both were getting less and less influential, whereas
                            the Chinese influence was increasing.</p>

                        <p>1. What are the differences, if any, among State, Defense, and the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> on policy in South Viet-Nam? <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> indicated that there were
                            generally no significant differences. He was questioned at length about
                            the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and said that he thought those
                            questions should really be answered by <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John
                                McCone</persName>; at the same time, however, he said that while the
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had carried out its mission as
                            prepared in Washington, he thought that the assignment had been overly
                            broad (operational in nature) and that this was now being corrected.</p>
                        <p>He observed that there were also no significant differences between
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, although characterizing <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> as the public figure and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> as the real operator,
                            with neither controlling <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame

                        <p>Hickenlooper asked whether there were any differences between <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RJH1">Richardson</persName> and, if so, were these bucked to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John McCone</persName>? <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> indicated he was not the best
                            one to answer that question. Hickenlooper was basing his questions on a
                            news article<note n="3" xml:id="d190fn3">The article by Richard Starnes,
                                “ 'Arrogant' <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Disobeys Orders in
                                Viet Nam,” was published in the Washington Daily News, October 2,
                                1963.</note> which he said had reported that State and the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> could not agree and had had to go to
                            the White House on it.</p>

                        <p>2. Hickenlooper dwelled at length on the incorrectness of the allegations
                            in the October 2 story in the “Daily News” by Richard Stearns [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and asked for a point-by-point refutation by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. Hickenlooper
                            indicated he would go over the same ground with the Secretary of
                                State.<note n="4" xml:id="d190fn4">Hickenlooper covered similar
                                ground with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>,
                                whose testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
                                October 9, is in the National Archives and Records Administration,

                            Hickenlooper is concerned primarily with defending the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> against critical attack.</p>
                        <p>3. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Morse</persName> asked a long
                            series of questions seeking the reason the U.S. is largely going it
                            alone and getting only token assistance from other countries.</p>
                        <p>4. Senators <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Morse</persName>, Carlson,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Church</persName> and Gore, all of whom
                            were most critical of U.S. policy in South Viet-Nam, asked whether there
                            is not an alternative to the present government and whether it was
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s opinion that it
                            could be effective despite the repressions and political difficulties
                            that have been encountered. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> kept trying to rephrase this line of questions
                            in terms of whether the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            Government is the most effective we can get under the circumstances.</p>
                        <p>5. Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> wanted to
                            know whether more, less, or about the same amount of aid will be needed
                            for South Viet-Nam in the future?</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> wanted to know what
                            the French are doing in South Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> wanted to know
                            whether the <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> cable<note n="5" xml:id="d190fn5">Apparent reference to telegram 243, <ref target="frus1961-63v03#d281">

                            cleared with the Defense Department and if not, why not? He was also
                            interested in obtaining comments on the substance of the cable.</p>
                        <p>8. Confirmation was requested as to the accuracy of the news story that
                            U.S. aid had been cut off for the special force which had led the raid
                            on the pagoda temples, for South Viet-Nam imports and for any other
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>9. Senator Gore asked a long line of questions as to whether an appraisal
                            of the situation in South Viet-Nam was primarily a military or political
                            question and, if the latter, the basis for Defense officials making the
                            basic reexamination of U.S. policy in the area?</p>
                        <p>Senators Hickenlooper and <persName corresp="#p_LF1">Lausche</persName>
                            generally defended the primary theme of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> that the U.S. is winning the war in South
                            Viet-Nam notwithstanding the repressions. <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Morse</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Church</persName>,
                            Gore and Carlson were sharply critical of it. <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName>, Aiken, <persName corresp="#p_MM2">Mansfield</persName> and Long did not indicate
                            their views.</p>

                        <p>666. A highly dependable source told me that three weeks ago in the early
                            hours of the morning, the police entered the premises of a Catholic
                            institution and removed three young women, taking them to a sort of
                            prison. In this place the women were not injured. But they saw a larger
                            number of male prisoners who were being tortured, some by beating, some
                            by the application of electric shocks to the genitals. Every day the
                            young women were given “brainwashing” in the form of lectures on
                            “personalism”. After two weeks they were allowed to return to their
                            previous abode but every three days they must report back to the prison
                            for a lecture.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> This looks like the application of a

                            following additional general thoughts which have been discussed with
                            President. While we do not wish to stimulate coup, we also do not wish
                            to leave impression that U.S. would thwart a change of government or
                            deny economic and military assistance to a new regime if it appeared
                            capable of increasing effectiveness of military effort, ensuring popular
                            support to win war and improving working relations with U.S. We would
                            like to be informed on what is being contemplated but we should avoid
                            being drawn into reviewing or advising on operational plans or any other
                            act which might tend to identify U.S. too closely with change in
                            government. We would, however, welcome information which would help us
                            assess character of any alternate leadership.</p>
                        <p>2. With reference to specific problem of General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> you should seriously consider
                            having contact take position that in present state his knowledge he is
                            unable present <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>'s case to
                            responsible policy officials with any degree of seriousness. In order to
                            get responsible officials even to consider <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>'s problem, contact would have to have detailed
                            information clearly indicating that <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>'s plans offer a high prospect of success. At
                            present contact sees no such prospect in the information so far
                            provided.</p>
                        <p>3. You should also consider with Acting Station Chief whether it would be
                            desirable in order to preserve security and deniability in this as well
                            as similar approaches to others whether appropriate arrangements could
                            be made for follow-up contacts by individuals brought in especially from
                            outside Vietnam. As we indicated in CAP 63560 we are most concerned
                            about security problem and we are confining knowledge these sensitive

                        <p>1. This refers to <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> cables [<hi rend="italic">2 document numbers not declassified</hi>].<note n="2" xml:id="d193fn2">In these telegrams, both October 9, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> distributed intelligence, which it
                                cautioned should “be treated with reserve”, to the effect that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had ordered a student
                                demonstration against the U.S. Embassy in which he planned to use

                                Embassy officials, and set the chancery afire. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> reportedly feared he could not
                                “handle” <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and wished
                                him “eliminated.” (Ibid., Har-Van Files, Coup South Vietnam)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. There has been some sort of assassination rumor on the average of
                            about one in every ten days since I have been here, and we have brushed
                            them aside. But the rumors in above-mentioned cables are sufficiently
                            believable to warrant fresh State-Defense planning on two major
                            points:</p>
                        <p>a. If I am assassinated in the way indicated in above reports, the deed
                            will in effect have been done by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, however much they attempt to disguise it, since they will
                            have instigated the mob and will have denied us the police protection
                            which they are totally capable of giving us in view of the very large
                            police force in Saigon which is under their absolute control. This will,
                            therefore, automatically constitute a rupture of diplomatic relations
                            and means that present assumptions underlying U.S. presence here would
                            be false. This will have grave consequences for all Americans in
                            Viet-Nam, notably as regards evacuation and there should be fresh
                            contingency planning to cover this situation.</p>
                        <p>b. If I am assassinated, a new situation would be created which might
                            give us a chance to move effectively for a change of government using
                            methods which would now be rejected by U.S. and world opinion, but which
                            would then become acceptable. There should be State-Defense planning on
                            this.</p>
                        <p>3. For <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> even to be thinking of my
                            assassination is so unbelievably idiotic that a reasonable person would
                            reject it out of hand. But <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is
                            apparently pleased with his raids on the Buddhist pagodas last summer
                            and is said to be annoyed with me for having advised him to leave the
                            country for awhile. Also he is reported to be smoking opium. For all
                            these reasons my associates here, whose experience antedates mine,
                            consider assassination to be real possibility. Needless to say, this
                            comes as no surprise, as I realized the possibility of this when I
                            accepted this post.</p>

                        <p>4. I hope to have the entrance gates to the building closed when crowd
                            begins to gather and for the Marines to throw tear gas from inside to
                            prevent crowd from breaking the gates down. If the crowd tries to enter
                            the building by throwing ladders or other catwalks from the Chinese
                            house next door over to our outside balconies, we will try to throw the
                            ladders off and use tear gas there, too. I plan immediate protest to

                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>. But I plan no shooting.</p>

                            retaliation will be prompt and awful beyond description. Source will be
                            invited to examine record of U.S. Marines in Pacific during WW II and
                            ask himself candidly whether <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> wishes
                            to have such a horrible and crushing blow descend on them. <note n="3" xml:id="d193fn3">

                            be glad to have such an evaluation now, in the light of the considerable

                        <p>2. Is the government responding at any point to our threefold need for

                        <p>2. The dominating factor during the week ending on 12 October 1963 was
                            the strong undercurrent of tension in United States-Government of
                            Vietnam (<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>) relationships, with the
                            Diem regime digesting and seeking to evaluate the implications of

                            articles in the Times of Vietnam, the regime professes to be most
                            impressed by the negative aspects of the Presidential policy
                            pronouncement, i.e., the references to the continued seriousness of the
                            political situation in South Vietnam. The Times of Vietnam chooses to
                            interpret the statements as indicative of continued American
                            determination to overthrow the regime if it does not give in to American
                            pressures for reform. The Times of Vietnam treatment of recent
                            developments conveys the unmistakable impression that the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> combine are prepared to dig in for a protracted war
                            of attrition with the United States, resisting pressures for reform,
                            seeking to mute these pressures by exploiting any differences which may
                            emerge among American policymakers, and attempting to deny the
                            alternative options of the United States by keeping a close watch on
                            dissident or potentially dissident elements in Saigon.</p>

                        <p>3. The American official community is also now being kept under close
                            scrutiny by the Vietnamese Police and other security elements; the
                            National Police Special Branch <persName corresp="#p_DVH1">Chief Duong
                                Van Hieu</persName>'s special action group is reportedly attempting
                            to develop incriminating dossiers on selected American officials.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> himself is reported to
                            have told a central Vietnamese political leader that while he was
                            strongly in favor of various programs, which could be continued, extreme
                            care should be exercised by responsible Vietnamese officials in their
                            relations with Americans. The most disturbing of all are the reports
                            suggesting the possibility that the regime might stage a “spontaneous”
                            demonstration against the American Embassy, possibly culminating in its
                            sacking and/or the assassination of key officials, including Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Henry Cabot Lodge</persName>, Jr. These
                            reports are difficult to evaluate, their sourcing is hazy, and it is
                            possible that they have been deliberately started by the regime as a
                            psychological warfare tactic, aimed at intimidating the United States
                            and keeping the United States off balance. General Confederation of
                            Vietnamese Labor President Tran Quoc Buu has claimed that rumors to the
                            effect that the American Embassy was going to be attacked have been
                            circulating for several weeks. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu</persName>
                            tends to discount them. However, it is believed that it would be a
                            mistake to discount the possibility completely.</p>
                        <p>4. Conversely, opponents of the regime, including a sizeable portion of
                            the Saigon urban elite both inside and outside of the government, appear
                            disheartened over, and in some cases contemptuous of, American failure
                            to react to what they consider to be highly provocative acts on the part
                            of the regime. The morale of these elements is also being adversely
                            affected by the continued atmosphere of fear and uncertainty brought
                            about by the heavy security controls and by additional arrests. Among
                            those who have been arrested recently are the Senior Vice President of
                            the General Confederation of Vietnamese Labor, Dam Sy Hien; the brother
                            of Lieutenant Colonel Bui Kien Tin, President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s physician; and Captain Dinh
                            Thanh Bich, aide to Brigadier General Van Thanh Cao, government delegate
                            for the southeastern provinces. The Special Police are reported to have
                            arrested 130 students in the Saigon area in a surprise roundup on the
                            night of 7 October.</p>
                        <p>5. Reports indicate, meanwhile, that the regime used the detention period
                            of the students who had been previously arrested b' subsequently

                            (Tong Hoi Sinh Vien Viet Nam) is being checked further.) The creation of
                            an ostensibly private student organization to monitor student activities
                            and to absorb or neutralize <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0426"/>other more genuine student groups is a typical action of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime, but it remains to be seen
                            whether, with the present mood of the students, it will be successful in
                            smothering or deflecting their discontent and anti-regime feeling. Other
                            reports indicate that various student groups are continuing to plan
                            anti-regime activities and that a trend toward some coalescence between
                            these hitherto disparate groups is beginning to develop.</p>
                        <p>6. There have been no self-burnings by bonzes since the one at the
                            Central Market Place on 5 October; however, Thich Tri Quang, in asylum
                            in the American Embassy, has remarked to Embassy officers that he
                            anticipates many more. The Secondary Intersect Committee leadership,
                            which was reported to have gone underground after the pagoda raids, is
                            probably badly fragmented; another report claimed that
                            intercommunication between various cells of the rebellious Buddhists has
                            been rendered difficult, if not impossible, by present heavy <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> security measures. Organization of
                            further bonze burnings, either by the compartmented cells of Intersect
                            leaders, or uncoordinated suicides by individual Buddhists, is perhaps
                            one of the few feasible gestures which remain open to the dissident
                            Buddhists.</p>
                        <p>7. We have received several reports tending to confirm indications of
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> belt tightening. Several sources
                            in Saigon have now reported that the government is indeed cutting back
                            on functionary salary payments. A consular officer in Hue reports a
                            similar practice was being adopted there. The policy may merely reflect
                            an anticipatory <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> response to a
                            possible US-initiated cutback in aid. A lesser possibility, but one
                            which cannot be overlooked, is that <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh
                                Nhu</persName> is conditioning officials to an eventual full break
                            with the United States, brought about at the initiative of the Diem
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>8. Little information has been received on the progress of the dialogue
                            between the Generals and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> on the
                            allocation of Cabinet portfolios to the military or on other demands
                            reportedly made by the Generals. One possible indication that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> may be meeting with some success in winning over the
                            Generals, or at least in playing for time, is the cool reception Joint
                            General Staff Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_TTKG1">Brigadier
                                General Tran Thien Khiem</persName> recently gave an American
                            official. <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> has been
                            undecided on the idea of a coup d'etat and it may be that he has been
                            persuaded that it is more in his interest to go along with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. Colonel Pham Ngoc Thao, a
                            self-admitted coup d'etat plotter, recently told an American observer
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> had informed him
                            that organizing a coup d'etat attempt had been made more difficult by
                            the American policy statement of 2 October, which <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> chose to interpret as
                            representing American capitulation to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> was also quoted as
                            stating that the Vietnamese people do not care who wins the war; they
                            simply want peace. Thao <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0427"/>speculated that the Generals' determination to effect a coup d'etat
                            may also have been eroded by <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s alleged promise to appoint Generals as Ministers
                            of National Defense, Interior, and Civic Action.</p>
                        <p>9. One of the major developments on the military front has been the
                            transfer of the Ninth Division, now virtually completed, from the Second
                            Corps area to the Delta, where it will be responsible for the security
                            of the middle tier of Delta provinces with the Seventh Division
                            operating in the provinces nearest Saigon and with the Twenty-First
                            Division remaining in the difficult Ca Mau Peninsula area. This transfer
                            should materially enhance prospects for the improvement in the Delta.
                            The Ninth Division should be especially useful in clear and hold
                            operations in support of the strategic hamlet construction and
                            consolidation, operations which have been all too lacking in the
                            critical Delta area. This unit pioneered in clear and hold operations in
                            Phu Yen and Binh Dinh Provinces. Although the Ninth Division transfer
                            was partially offset in the Second Corps areas by the dispatch of an
                            independent regiment from Long An, it will thin out the forces in the
                            central coastland area. The Vietnamese Communists in the past two weeks
                            have already moved to capitalize on the period of the transfer to
                            substantially step up activities in Binh Dinh Province, the location of
                            one of the more successful <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> province
                            rehabilitation programs. However, in a recent company-sized attack, the
                            enemy sustained a substantial defeat at the hands of the Twenty-Fifth
                            Division, which now is responsible for Binh Dinh and Phu Yen.</p>

                        <p>1. “Are we gaining or losing on balance and day by day in the contest
                            with the Viet Cong?”</p>
                        <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0429"/>
                        <p>Answer: We appear to me to be doing little more than holding our own.
                            This looks like a long, smoldering struggle, with political and military
                            aspects intertwined, each of which is stubborn in its own way.</p>
                        <p>Our presence here is a stabilizing influence in Viet-Nam and in Southeast
                            Asia; it also keeps the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> from being
                            overthrown, which would undoubtedly happen if we were not here. But the
                            U.S. cannot make the people like the Government of Viet-Nam-and hatred
                            of the government could ultimately be deadly serious as regards Army
                            personnel, Army performance, and holding the gains which the Army makes
                            by putting into operation a really effective social and economic program
                            in the strategic hamlets.</p>
                        <p>2. “Is the government responding at any point to our three fold need for
                            improvement in (a) campaign against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>,
                            (b) internal political developments and (c) actions affecting relations
                            with American people and government?”</p>
                        <p>Answer: Under (a) General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            reports a shift of boundaries and reallocation of forces. As regards (b)
                            and (c), it is perhaps too early to conclude that the government will
                            not make some positive moves, but it is now doing the opposite of what
                            we would like to see done.</p>
                        <p>3. “What does the evidence suggest on the strengthening or weakening of
                            effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in relation to its
                            own people?”</p>
                        <p>Answer: The evidence suggests that the Government of Viet-Nam has some of
                            the strength which the government of a police state has, as long as the
                            police remain strong and dependable and the government continues to
                            control the police. Clearly Viet-Nam has such a force and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> clearly controls it. But Viet-Nam is
                            not a thoroughly strong police state (much as the “family” would like to
                            make it one) because, unlike Hitler's Germany, it is not efficient and
                            it has in the Viet Cong a large and well-organized underground opponent
                            strongly and ever-freshly motivated by vigorous hatred. And its numbers
                            never diminish.</p>
                        <p>Viet-Nam has had some kind of war on its soil for more than twenty years,
                            and the people appear to be more than ever anxious to be left alone. In
                            the country, where 85 percent of the people live, as Graham Greene said,
                            “They want enough rice; they don't want to be shot at; they want one day
                            to be much the same as another.” Vietnamese are said to be capable of
                            great violence on occasion, but there is no sign of it at the present
                            time.</p>
                        <p>4. “And more specifically, what effect are we getting from our own
                            actions under Deptel 534 and what modifications in either direction do
                            you think advisable?”</p>
                        <p>Answer: So far we appear to be getting virtually no effect from our
                            actions under Deptel 534, but we would not have expected effects this
                            early. The salient action under that program is the withholding of
                            commercial imports. Some local businessmen are worried, but our
                            withholding has not brought a request to me from President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, even though Thuan has told me
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is worried too.
                            Frankly, I do not expect him to speak to me about it because of his
                            suspicion that, if he asks me to do something for him, I would ask him
                            what he is prepared to do for the U.S. He can, of course, dip into his
                            foreign exchange reserves to meet the cost of the Army for a few months
                            and, in my judgment, that is what he ought to do. If the Army does not
                            mean that much to him, then how can he expect it to mean so much to us?
                            But I oppose continuing to withhold commercial imports to the point
                            where an economic crisis is produced which might bring about a popular
                            outbreak. This could be extremely dangerous and might result in
                            important and perhaps irreversible Communist gains.</p>

                            Gia Long Palace by appointment on the morning of October 17. The meeting
                            lasted approximately 45 minutes. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_SMGRG1">Stilwell</persName> opened the conversation by stating that he had
                            recently been traveling with Acting <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> Chief of Staff, Major General <persName corresp="#p_TVDMG1">Tran Van Don</persName>, to various subordinate
                            headquarters throughout Vietnam and that the purpose of these travels
                            had been to insure that all units were making full contribution to the
                            war effort. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_SMGRG1">Stilwell</persName> added
                            that in this light, this meeting had been requested with <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> immediately stated,
                            “You've come to talk about the special forces.” Gen. <persName corresp="#p_SMGRG1">Stilwell</persName> and the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 1ine not declassified</hi>] acknowledged that this was
                            true and then proceeded to explain the structure and support of special
                            forces units in the Saigon area. It was pointed out that of ten special
                            forces companies, seven are members or <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and are <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>-supported;
                            three companies are civilian [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 1ine not

                                declassified</hi>] then stated that he was instructed to indicate to
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> that unless the
                            civilian companies were effectively subordinated to the <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> and committed to field operations, all
                            support of these companies would cease. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_SMGRG1">Stilwell</persName> added that this applied to
                            the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>-supported units also but would
                            be reflected in the long term, under the conditions specified, by a
                            decrease equivalent to seven companies in the overall <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support budget. It was carefully
                            explained that the purpose of this action was to place these units in
                            direct support of the war effort under his control.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> seemed to absorb this
                            fully and repeated his understanding that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                1ine not declassified</hi>] support of special forces would cease
                            unless Vietnamese special forces are effectively subordinated to the
                                <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> and committed to field
                            operations. </p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> was further informed
                            that henceforth payments to mountain scouts and border surveillance
                            personnel would be made only through US Special Forces mechanisms and
                            funds for these programs would no longer be given directly to Col.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> was assured that the actual
                            passage of funds would be through the hands of Vietnamese, not American,
                            officers but that American Special Forces working with their Vietnamese
                            counterparts in the provinces would directly oversee the expenditures of
                            these funds. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> was
                            interested in the amounts involved and seemed surprised at their
                            magnitude.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> was told that the USG
                            does not plan any public announcement of this step but, if it became
                            known and if the Embassy were queried, we would state that this action
                            had been taken since we cannot support forces not directly contributing
                            to the war effort. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>
                            <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0431"/>was also informed that this
                            matter would also be taken up directly with Col. <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName>. He concurred in this and stated
                            that he would discuss the matter immediately with the President.</p>

                        <p>Dear Jonh: I hope I am being overly pessimistic but the days immediately
                            ahead look rather dark for <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>. Your
                            memo to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d199fn2">Not found.</note> pertaining to the
                            possible closing down of our field support posts is disquieting. So is
                            the fact that the attacks on <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> not
                            only continue in the Times of Viet-Nam but are now being extended to
                            vernacular newspapers.</p>
                        <p>I have one thought on the situation which perhaps may be gratuitous, but
                            I would not feel right if I did not pass it on to you. Since the
                            pressure on USIS may well include increased personal pressure on you of
                            the type you have already experienced, you must be extremely careful in
                            the weeks ahead to be cleaner than a hound's tooth. It seems to me that
                            you may have to be unusually circumspect in your relations with the
                            Vietnamese and the U.S. correspondents in order not to allow the GVN the
                            possibility of laying a real glove on you.</p>
                        <p>I am sure you have thought of this already. I suppose, also, that if the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> decides to cut <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> down and cut you down too, what you
                            do will make little difference. But in case they're undecided and
                            wavering, it surely is important that we don't give them any unnecessary
                            excuses for action.</p>
                        <p>Ed is really doing very well in light of the magnitude of his operation.
                            I went out to see him several days ago and we had a good talk. His
                            spirit and his guts are pure Murrow. We discussed Viet-Nam and he asked
                            me to send you his warmest regards.</p>

                        <p>Although I am sure I am telling you nothing new, I thought it might be
                            worthwhile to set down some of the evidence that we are heading into a
                            period of considerable difficulty in maintaining cohesion and momentum
                            in our policy toward the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. It is all
                            very well for us to assert that all Washington agencies are now agreed
                            upon a policy of graduated pressure on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> designed to obtain: 1) continuing progress in war
                            effort, 2) improvement in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s
                            popular support, and 3) improvement in relations between the US and the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. At the same time we must—and
                            do—recognize that these objectives are to a considerable extent mutually
                            incompatible, and not necessarily likely to be achieved by the measures
                            available to us. In addition to this, despite protestations of unity,
                            the interests of State, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the
                            Pentagon are necessarily disparate.</p>
                        <p>As I see it, it is quite clear that the first serious problem confronting
                            us here in Washington as we attempt to pursue a policy that really
                            satisfies no one is going to arise with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John McCone</persName>
                            expressed at some length and reportedly with considerable vigor at the
                            day before yesterday's (October 16) Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>)<note n="2" xml:id="d200fn2">No record of
                                this meeting has been found.</note> the view that we are going to
                            have “an explosion” in Vietnam in the very near future. I am not sure
                            precisely what <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> had in
                            mind, but I imagine that he was asserting for the record one of his
                            familiar “visceral” feelings. These, as we know, are sometimes right
                            (Soviet missiles in Cuba) and sometimes wrong (<gloss target="#t_CHICOM1">ChiCom</gloss> major attack on India), but I
                            also think there is more to his present view than this. I suspect he is
                            quite legitimately concerned about the likelihood we will be able to
                            continue a successful war effort (in which his agency is to some extent
                            involved) while at the same time, we are holding up economic aid as well
                            as in effect encouraging political uncertainty in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The original <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> horseback opinion of how long it would be before
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> felt the economic squeeze was
                            two to four months. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> may
                            be arguing that the cumulative effect of political-economic unease will
                            bring things to a head in much shorter order. As a further speculation,
                            I would suggest that he may think that the development <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0433"/>of an explosive situation is unlikely
                            to redound to our benefit, that an alternative government acceptable and
                            useful to us is unlikely to arise, and that the communist Viet Cong is
                            in the best position to exploit the chaos that could ensue.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (15 lines) and handwritten marginal
                                notation not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>In sum, I believe we can expect McCone now to argue that the consequences
                            of our present course are going to be unhelpful in the extreme and that
                            we should, therefore, edge quite rapidly back toward what might be
                            described as our policy toward Vietnam before last August.</p>
                        <p>I do not see any signs that the Pentagon has yet reached similar
                            conclusions. In view of the military responsibility for getting on with
                            the war, however, I would be astonished if they were not impressed by
                            the line of reasoning I would expect <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> to advance.</p>
                        <p>I conclude that we may have rapidly increasing difficulty in inducing the
                            rest of the town to live with the untidiness that we at least have fully
                            expected to accompany pursuit of our present policy. Unless we can
                            effectively refute the argument that our present course is trending
                            toward “an explosion”, we are going to have to assert with some
                            considerable confidence that such an explosion is to our benefit.
                            Perhaps all we can hope to do now is to hold the line at least until
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> gets back here for
                            consultation. It may be that what he has in mind is some positive
                            thinking on ways in which we can, in fact, insure that any “explosion”
                            is exploitable to our advantage.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Problem:</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense has referred to the Department of State a
                            proposed release (Tab A)<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2">Not printed.</note>
                            on plans to withdraw 1,000 U.S. military personnel from the Republic of
                            Vietnam beginning in November. The release also states that as of
                            October 30 there will be 16,730 U.S. military personnel in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion:</p>
                        <p>This will be the first time that the Defense Department will have
                            officially announced a total figure for U.S. military personnel in South
                            Viet-Nam, although high U.S. Government officials, including the
                            President and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, have made statements or given interviews on the
                            record in which figures close to 15,000 have been used. The release,
                            therefore, makes official what has more or less been official
                            information for the last few months. The coupling of the figure on troop
                            strength with the figure on withdrawal of military personnel is based on
                            the view that speculation on the number of U.S. military personnel in
                            South Viet-Nam is inevitable once the withdrawal of the 1,000 becomes
                            known. Hence the desire on the part of the Defense Department to have an
                            actual figure publicly available to which newsmen can be referred.</p>
                        <p>From a policy standpoint the official Department of Defense release poses
                            a possible complication that may result from International Control
                            Commission action. Under the terms of the Geneva Accord of 1954 the U.S.
                            is not supposed to have more than 888 military advisers in South
                            Viet-Nam. At the time the U.S. began its expanded military effort in
                            South Viet-Nam in the fall of 1961, it was decided not to face this
                            question directly, and U.S. troop strength was built up without making a
                            figure publicly and officially available. Of course, statements made by
                            the President and the Secretary of Defense amount essentially to a
                            public disclosure of the size of our troop strength, clearly indicating
                            that we are well above the levels provided for in the Geneva Accord on
                            Viet-Nam. However, the official Defense Department release may leave the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> in Saigon with no alternative
                            but to cite the U.S. for violation of the Geneva Accord and to call on
                            the U.S. to withdraw all personnel in excess of the 888 permitted by the
                            Accord.</p>

                        <p>1. General. To date there have been no clear indications that US actions
                            have had an adverse effect on war effort either in military or economic
                            spheres. People in countryside largely unaware of recent developments in
                                US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> relations or if aware do not
                            feel these developments affect their lives directly. Among educated
                            classes in urban areas general aura of unrest and discontent persists
                            beneath surface. Most significant psychological reaction understandably
                            taking place among business community (US, Vietnamese, Chinese and other
                                <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0436"/>foreign businessmen) in
                            Saigon/Cholon area. We have received increasing number reports
                            businessmen worried over suspension <gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>

                            US aid. Price of gold has increased sharply. Other businessmen seeking
                            unload large sums plasters at 120 to dollar or find investments yielding

                            conflicting, concern in business community, and to certain extent in
                            general public, has definitely deepened over past few days (see
                            below).</p>
                        <p>Reaction by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to US measures continues
                            in subterranean ways. We hear continued rumors, probably officially
                            inspired, of plans for sacking Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>. Times of Vietnam has continued its drumfire of
                            articles strongly supporting <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            policies and attacking elements of US Mission allegedly opposing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> by overt and covert means. Reports from
                            various sources indicate <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> currently
                            engaged in planning belt-tightening measures.</p>
                        <p>2. Economic. Key prices of imports during week reversed pattern and took
                            long-expected rise. Most important were sweetened condensed milk (by up
                            to 10 percent, depending on brand), wheat flour (33 percent), and cement
                            (30 percent), as well as chemical products, some iron and steel products
                            in shortest supply, and miscellaneous manufactured imports.</p>
                        <p>Failure to rise previously in spite of expected shortages was reportedly
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-inspired belief procurement
                            authorizations would be issued mid-October. Trade sources report there
                            had been some quiet speculative buying. Now canned milk and flour harder

                            last flour shipments and is expected do same with coming milk arrivals.
                            Thus, though supplies otherwise adequate till January, appears
                            speculators have started create artificial shortages now. In case of
                            cement, price rise can be explained in part as normal seasonal
                            fluctuation, as end of rains allow resumption building; recent rise
                            brings price only to official level.</p>
                        <p>Wholesale rice price also rose 8 percent since September 24, following
                            47,000-ton sale Philippines, 38,000 tons of which was from private

                        <p>4. Military. In addition to continuation of pressures which have been
                            underway for some time the following specific actions have been taken on
                            military side with results as indicated:</p>
                        <p>a. Previously proposed and recently re-emphasized suggestion to relocate
                            corps boundaries in order to place greater emphasis in Delta has (with
                            minor modification) been adopted by President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and will become effective 1
                            November.</p>
                        <p>b. Previously proposed suggestion to place Vietnamese Special Forces
                            elements operating in various corps areas under the operational control
                            of corps commanders has been adopted by Gen Don and <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> Directive promulgated.</p>
                        <p>c. <gloss target="#t_USMACV1">USMACV</gloss> J-3 and Gen Don have made
                            country wide tour visiting all corps and cmd with view to determining
                            [garble—what?] measures required; to place greater emphasis in Delta; to
                            stimulate increase in operational tempo in all areas; and to accomplish
                            other directed actions. These measures will be subject of another <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> letter to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5. Political. In general there have been no favorable developments on
                            various measures we would like see adopted in political area. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> have reacted to pressure by digging in more deeply
                            and attempted exert discreet counter pressure on their own. On
                            resumption of normal university life, University of Hue has reopened
                            except for medical faculty which expected open this week; however,
                            student <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0438"/>attendance from 60-70
                            percent and general atmosphere at University remains sullen. No firm
                            information when University of Saigon may reopen. Appears that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> now attempting assess whether students
                            actually will attend classes in sufficient numbers to give appearance of
                            normalcy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> general position re Buddhists is
                            that Buddhist issue solved. While over one hundred Buddhist bonzes and
                            faithful released from jail in Hue recently, many remain under detention
                            including two leading bonzes who negotiated joint communique of June 16
                            and ranking lay leader. Such actions taken by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to date can be interpreted as moves on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> part to demonstrate Buddhist problem
                            solved rather than as concessions to Buddhists. Also, some indication
                            that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will not move quickly to repeal
                            or modify Decree Law 10. In meantime Buddhist faithful staying away from
                            pagodas through fear of government reprisals. In sum, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> appears believe any previous
                            concessions to Buddhists under US pressure are interpreted by Buddhist
                            leadership as weakness and further concessions not warranted and
                            self-defeating.</p>
                        <p>Nothing significant to report re land reform. Similarly few recent
                            indications (if any) re specific re-emphasis of political aspects of
                            Strategic Hamlet Program, which would be geared in any event to tempo of
                            construction and development of strategic hamlets. Hamlet elections are
                            proceeding as hamlets built and organized. Self-help projects and
                            economic follow-on assistance in development phase are receiving good
                            reception by hamlet populace. Concrete benefits can be expected to
                            result in progressive identification of hamlet populace with the
                            government at least on local level.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has not abandoned extreme police
                            measures and shows no inclination do so in immediate future. Night
                            arrests continue although on reduced scale. Similarly, no action has
                            been taken by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to restore civil
                            liberties. On contrary, actions to date seem designed to impress any
                            potential oppositionists among educated classes that they can not count
                            on any guarantees of civil liberties and are at mercy of security organs
                            of the regime.</p>
                        <p>With regard to refurbishing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> image
                            through broadening of government, etc; no concrete actions have been
                            taken. Rumors persist that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            will announce Cabinet changes and realignment certain government
                            functions. However, should this occur it likely to be mere window
                            dressing since most unlikely <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> now contemplates any action which might undermine
                            power position and solidarity of Ngo family. While we cannot discount
                            possibility of Cabinet shuffle for optical purposes, we see no signs
                            that any reduction of influence of the Nhus is in the offing. In fact,
                            harassment of Americans both through newspaper attacks, arrests of
                            Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> local employees, <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0439"/>and general freeze on normal
                            contacts between Americans and their Vietnamese counterparts would
                            indicate that family still believes it has strong cards to play.</p>
                        <p>At this juncture little prospect for public and official statement by

                            Friday evening.<note n="2" xml:id="d203fn2">October 18.</note> When we
                            were seated off to one side, he said:</p>
                        <p>“The President wanted me to ask you whether Washington had reached any
                            decision regarding resumption of commercial imports.”</p>
                        <p>He then continued without a pause, but with a pleasant smile on his
                            face:</p>
                        <p>“And I told him I believed they had not. Is that right?”</p>
                        <p>After I said that as far as I knew no decision had been reached, he said,
                            again with a broad grin on his face:</p>
                        <p>“That's what I thought and told the President. I will tell him that
                            that's what you think.”</p>
                        <p>After a few desultory remarks I said that I had great hope that the time
                            would come when I would be able to show by my actions the strong
                            feelings of friendship which I have for Viet-Nam. He said:</p>
                        <p>“I have faith that all of this is going to work out so that your mission
                            will be a great success. I don't know how or when but I think it will be
                            soon.”</p>
                        <p>He then asked me what I thought about the statements <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> was making on her trip.
                            Before I had even a chance to answer he said:</p>
                        <p>“Why does she have to say such things as her remark that all the people
                            around President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> are
                            pink?”</p>
                        <p>I said that I did not know but the one thing I was sure of was that in a
                            country like the United States where public opinion counts for so much,
                            it is a very serious matter when two persons as prominent as Mr. and
                            Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> get such consistently
                            bad publicity. It was for this reason that I had advised that they drop
                            out of sight for a while and simply be quiet. It was evident they had
                            not taken my advice but I felt it was all too clear that my advice has

                        <p>Political Counsellor <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>
                            said Thursday<note n="6" xml:id="d204fn6">October 17.</note> that the
                            Vietnamese people have lost their confidence in the U.S. Government. The
                            Counsellor made the statement in an interview with visiting foreign
                            newsmen. He said he could not understand why the United States has
                            “initiated a process of disintegration at a time when we are winning.
                            People here are wondering what the United States is doing. There is an
                            atmosphere at [of] distrust. People have lost confidence in the United
                            States.”</p>
                        <p>He said: “Whether it is under this government or under some other
                            government, the confidence between the Vietnamese people and the
                            American government has been lost.”</p>
                        <p>He said that arrested Buddhist leaders claimed “a half dozen” U.S.
                            intelligence agency agents and employees of American “civilian” agencies
                            in Vietnam had urged them to stage a coup d'etat and had incited
                            Buddhists to commit suicide. “Some of the bonzes (Buddhist priests) in
                            detention have freely revealed that some <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> agents encouraged them. Their stories check so well
                            that they cannot be untrue. The bonzes have named a half dozen <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> agents plus some other employees of
                            American civilian government agencies here. Some of these people are
                            still here. Some have gone. Day and night they urged the bonzes to stage
                            a coup against the government, “the Counsellor told newsmen.</p>
                        <p>He said he could not understand why these <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> agents got involved in the Buddhist affair since he and
                            the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officials had been working
                            marvelously together in what many have termed the “winning program”—the
                            strategic hamlet program—and that <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> himself had understood the need and meaning of
                            that program. “I do not know whether they had received instructions from
                            their higher-ups, but I must say that until this Buddhist affair broke
                            out, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had played an important
                            part in making this winning program a success,” he said.</p>
                        <p>Asked why these <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> agents worked against
                            him, Counsellor <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said: “I do
                            not know. Maybe they had received orders to do it against their will and
                            judgment.” These agents were not from the Army, he emphasized.</p>
                        <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0443"/>
                        <p>He told the correspondents: “The trust which has existed between Vietnam
                            and America has ceased to exist now. This is true also of relations
                            between the United States and the whole of the underdeveloped world. For
                            us in Vietnam, it will be difficult to go up the hill again (an apparent
                            reference to the possibility of improvement in U.S.-Vietnamese relations
                            in the future). The Vietnamese Government will need much wisdom to
                            recover from what has been done in the past few months. I do not see
                            what U.S. policy is at this stage.”</p>
                        <p>Counsellor <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> referred to these
                            troubles as “this whole mess in Vietnam,” and said American public
                            opinion appeared to be trying to make “scapegoats” out of himself and
                            the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> for it.</p>
                        <p>The Counsellor pointed out in the interview that an abrupt, sharp cut in
                            U.S. aid to Vietnam would have grave consequences in the economy as well
                            as in the military effort, especially if such a cut is decided
                            unilaterally. “To me, aid should be reduced progressively and by
                            agreement between the two governments. This is something to be expected
                            because American aid to us is something that cannot go on forever,” he
                            said.</p>
                        <p>Any sudden reduction of aid would place the Vietnamese Government in such
                            a position as to be forced to make deep and drastic changes, stronger
                            measures to more quickly bring about economic development, curb
                            privileges, and promote more social justice, he explained. Such a
                            drastic policy would involve changing everything, he added.</p>
                        <p>He said he did not understand why, since the U.S. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> normally releases funds in advance without waiting for
                            congressional approval, it now is waiting for Congress to approve such
                            funds. “There are two main effects so far,” the Counsellor said. “The
                            first one is to compel the Vietnamese Government to use its reserves of
                            foreign currencies and the second is to bring about black market and its
                            consequences. That leads to a poisoning of the situation and no doubt
                            brings its adverse effects to the war effort … . “<note n="7" xml:id="d204fn7">Ellipsis in the source text.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now if for one reason or another this aid is reduced, we shall have to do
                            what the Communists have done. The Counsellor also referred to the
                            solution of Algeria, which has been nationalizing major industries.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he personally
                            believed the system of U.S. aid here should be changed to a lend-lease
                            type whereby the Vietnamese Government would repay the United States for
                            military equipment and other necessities. “It (the lend-lease type
                            program) would preserve our dignity and make us more conscious of our
                            obligation.”</p>
                        <p>He added: “The other advantage would be that the United States would not
                            be morally involved in the situation.” He also said the U.S. withdrawal
                            from Laos had frightened nationalist opponents of the <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0444"/>Vietnamese and convinced them to
                            cooperate with the government in fighting the Communists. “I do not
                            think U.S. policy is to withdraw from Vietnam as from Laos, but I detect
                            a wavering,” the Counsellor said.</p>
                        <p>Asked whether the Vietnamese Government would object to the U.N.
                            fact-finding mission talking privately with the “bonzes” being held at
                            the U.S. Embassy, the Counsellor replied that, first of all, that would
                            be the responsibility of the U.S. Embassy. “The responsibility rests
                            with the United States, this responsibility we don't want the United
                            States to throw on us. We want the American government to take the full
                            responsibility in this case, he said.<note n="8" xml:id="d204fn8">Forrestal sidelined this paragraph.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Asked if the Vietnamese Government would present evidence of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> involvement in the Buddhist affair to
                            the U.N. fact-finding team, the Counsellor said that the government will
                            do everything it can to avoid washing dirty linen between America and
                            Vietnam in public, unless the American Government decides to kill us
                            through the intermediary role of this U.N. commission.”</p>

                        <p>On October 22, 1963, the Director of the Bureau of Intelligence and

                            RFE-90, entitled “Statistics on the War Effort in South Vietnam Show
                            Unfavorable Trends.” The abstract of the paper reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Statistics on the insurgency in South Vietnam, although neither
                            thoroughly trustworthy nor entirely satisfactory as criteria, indicate
                            an unfavorable shift in the military balance. Since July 1963, the trend
                            in Viet Cong casualties, weapons losses, and defections has been
                            downward while the number of Viet Cong armed attacks and other incidents
                            has been upward. Comparison with earlier periods suggests that the
                            military position of the government of Vietnam may have been set back to
                            the point it occupied six months to a year ago. These trends coincide in
                            time with the sharp deterioration of the political situation. At the
                            same time, even without the Buddhist issue and the attending government
                            crisis, it is possible that the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime would have been unable to maintain the

                            analysts. The report concluded that the military effort had been
                            deteriorating in important ways for several months.” Apparently

                        </p>
                        <p>2. Khuong asked if source believed US/press/military reports that war
                            would be won by 1965? Also, had he (source) wondered why <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units failed to attack/press their
                            advantage/kill more <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>? Khuong stated
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> has the equipment, knowledge
                            and ability to win but doesn't want to win and will not win war so long
                            as present government remains in power. Khuong added, if things continue
                            unchanged <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will win by 1965, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> now in phase III (change from company to

                        <p>3. Khuong then came to point: A small, powerful group military officers
                            who can control sufficient forces are prepared to launch a coup against
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government. He outlined
                            how they can assassinate <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            almost at will, replace corrupt/incompetent military, cabinet, and
                            province officials, prosecute the war against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, recall political refugees from France/<gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, and establish a new government. While
                            this group fears <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, they
                            especially fear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> who they
                            consider will surely succeed <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and who will seek reunification of North and South
                            Vietnam through neutralist solution.</p>
                        <p>4. Khuong, realizing his own conspirators' lives are at stake if
                            compromised, stated there were four <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> generals and at least six colonels involved. Partial
                            list included: Maj Gen Duong Van “Big” Minh, <persName corresp="#p_LVNBG1">Brig Gen Le Van Nghiem</persName> (ex I Corps

                        <p>5. Khuong is seeking assurance of US recognition and support following
                            coup. If coup approach not acceptable alternate solution to establish
                            radio station in some pro-US Asian nation such as Thailand, Korea,
                            Philippines, from which an anti-government campaign could be

                        <p>Question 1: Are we gaining or losing on balance and day by day in the
                            contest with the Viet Cong?</p>
                        <p>Answer: A. There appears to have been no significant change in the last
                            week on a day-by-day basis. But a thoroughly responsive answer to this
                            question requires one to strike a balance between a multiplicity of
                            often contradictory military, political, social and economic “facts”—any
                            one of which can be used to prove almost anything</p>
                        <p>B. To strike a balance, the word “victory” must first be defined. How do
                            we know when we have won? My definition is: a condition in which large
                            numbers of Viet Cong surrender (as their counterparts did in Malaya) and
                            others simply don't report for duty anymore. All that would then remain
                            would be sporadic banditry which the regular police forces could
                            handle.</p>
                        <p>C. This condition would be reached when, to use Mao Tse Tung's figure of
                            speech, there is no longer friendly water in which the Viet Cong's fish
                            can swim. In the condition the people no longer like the Viet Cong, no
                            longer want to see them around, no longer give them food or
                            information.</p>
                        <p>D. The people come to feel this way, first, because the farmer feels safe
                            and is not being shot at; and then because his government does not
                            oppress him with burdensome taxes and forced labor; because he is making
                            a good living; because he thinks his strategic hamlet is a good place in
                            which to live, with enough food, with a school, with a dispensary, with
                            the beginnings of local democracy; because he has learned how to control
                            rats and insects and how to produce hogs; because his fishing is
                            better.</p>
                        <p>E. Favorable factors towards bringing the above about are:</p>
                        <p>F. First and foremost is the work of the U.S. and Vietnamese military
                            which is not only the hope for future victory, but is today a tremendous
                            obstacle to total Viet Cong domination of the country. This result is
                            being achieved at a much lower cost than would be the case if we were to
                            do it alone, as the French tried to do. We are also <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0448"/>doing much on long-range economic and
                            social programs which should have lasting value. The strategic hamlet
                            idea too is most constructive. While many of the hamlets are not up to
                            standard, there are undoubtedly some which are really good in an
                            all-around way, that is, they are not merely little armed camps where
                            people are given a chance to defend themselves, but true communities
                            which appeal to the whole man and which also have dependable sources of
                            military support from outside. Vice President Tho said there are only 15
                            to 20 such all-around hamlets in the area south of Saigon which are
                            really good. Let us hope this is low. Finally it can also be said that
                            the rice crop is moving into the city regularly.</p>
                        <p>G. Unfavorable factors:</p>
                        <p>H. This is after all a pacification effort which really cannot be
                            considered successful as long as one cannot drive as much around the
                            country as one could two years ago and so long as gunfire can still be
                            clearly heard from Saigon. Then there are not only no mass surrenders;
                            on the contrary, the Viet Cong is always up to strength and is, in fact,
                            reckoned at a higher figure than it was two years ago, even though it is
                            often said that 24,000 Viet Cong have been killed during that period.
                            The hatred of the government continues to be an incentive for young men
                            to join the Viet Cong. And, this hatred is sure to have harmful effects
                            on the Army. In fact, there are signs that it has already tended to
                            diminish the Army's vigor, enthusiasm and enterprise. The rumors that
                            the Generals are being paid off with money and with flashy cars, which
                            are much in evidence, are believable. Finally, the report of the Delta
                            Subcommittee of the Committee on Province Rehabilitation, which includes
                            representatives of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>, and Embassy, dated October 14,<note n="3" xml:id="d207fn3">Not found.</note> specifically says: that the
                            Delta situation is serious; that it gives cause for concern; that while
                            our side has ample resources, it is making unsatisfactory progress, but
                            that the Viet Cong are gaining.</p>
                        <p>I. Unless there is a change in government therefore, it would appear that
                            the hatred is bound to grow. Also, the existing political control over
                            troop movements, which prevents optimum use of the Army, would be bound
                            to continue. And, therefore, when it comes to defeating the Viet Cong,
                            time is not working for us as long as the government is run by brother
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> in the way in which he is
                            now doing it.</p>
                        <p>J. All this could be quickly changed. But present circumstances compel me
                            to say that in the contest with the Viet Cong, we at present are not
                            doing much more than holding our own.</p>
                        <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0449"/>
                        <p>K. We have done and are doing big things in Viet-Nam which are changing
                            the country basically for the better. In the forefront is the
                            intelligent, courageous, and selfless leadership of the U.S. military
                            which is bold yet practical and is in the best American tradition. There
                            is the excellent economic and social work of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>. We are, by all these means, producing an instrument
                            which, if properly used by the Government of Viet-Nam, would bring
                            victory. But at present the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s main
                            preoccupation with protecting its own internal power structure seems
                            greater than its preoccupation with victory over the Viet Cong. And the
                            Viet Cong is developing.</p>
                        <p>Question 2: Is the government responding at any point to our threefold
                            need for improvement in (a) campaign against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, (b) internal political developments and (c) actions
                            affecting relations with American people and government?</p>
                        <p>Answer: A. Under (a) General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> reports that “in no case has Government of
                            Viet-Nam flatly resisted recommended improvements”.</p>
                        <p>Under (b) there has been no significant improvement in internal political
                            situation during past week. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> engaged
                            in extensive security sweeps and arrests of student leaders to prevent
                            demonstrations during visit of UNGA delegations. All evidence to date
                            points to concentrated <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> attempt to
                            cow potential adverse witnesses and prevent their appearing before the
                            delegation and to keep delegation busy on a cook's tour. Great interest
                            in UNGA delegation among educated Vietnamese coupled with a general
                            belief that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will not permit
                            delegation to function freely. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            reacted strongly against my approach concerning UNGA delegations access
                            to <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>. Rumors abound of
                            further student agitation, more self-immolations during delegation's
                            visit, and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-inspected attacks against
                            Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>B. But I am nonetheless sure our actions under <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 534 are producing results. For one thing, Thuan told
                            me that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was worried and
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> directed <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> to ask me on October 19 whether
                            Washington had reached any decision on commercial imports.<note n="4" xml:id="d207fn4">See <ref target="#d203">Document 203</ref>.</note>
                            Then experienced observers believe that our actions are creating
                            favorable conditions for a coup. Although I as yet see no one who looks
                            as though he means business in this regard, General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> has said he was impressed by
                            commercial import suspension and said that our action regarding Colonel
                                <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> was “one of the best
                            things” we had done. See also <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Saigon

                                23, General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> contacted
                                Conein on October 23 to inform him that the Generals' coup committee
                                planned to take advantage of the presence of its members in Saigon
                                during the October 26 national holiday to stage a coup within the
                                week. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> was concerned about
                                a conversation he had with <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> on October 22. <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> reamed of the Generals' plans because a
                                member of <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>'s staff,
                                Colonel Khuong, had contacted a <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> officer and asked for support of the coup and
                                recognition of the new government. <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> that it was the wrong time to stage a coup
                                because the war against the Viet Cong was progressing well. To make
                                matters worse, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had reamed of
                                Khuong's approach and had extended the assignment of two key
                                divisions outside the Saigon area. The coup leaders had planned on
                                these units supporting the coup in Saigon. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> repudiated Khuong and told
                                Conein that he would be disciplined by the coup committee. Conein
                                challenged <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> to produce
                                proof that a coup committee existed. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> promised to turn over plans for political
                                organization to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> on October 24. (Kennedy Library, National

                        <p>C. While I cannot prove it, I believe our actions are making <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> much more careful about repressive measures-at least
                            about getting caught. I also believe our actions under <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 534 constitute the first time
                            that the U.S. has sought to discharge its moral responsibility for the
                            behavior of this government, which surely would not stay in office
                            without us. This is understood and appreciated and has attracted
                            attention.</p>
                        <p>D. My present thought is that we should continue with this suspension at
                            least until Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s trip is
                            over and at least until the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has
                            dipped into their foreign exchange reserves. We should stop short of an

                        <p>2. Col. <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> reacted strongly to
                            the statement that Special Forces would no longer be supported unless
                            they are subordinated to the direct, effective control of the <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss>. He claimed Special Forces are already
                            under such control and that he “renders account” to the <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> of the movements of all his companies.
                            It was pointed out that this was not satisfactory; that the US Govt
                            desired unity of command whereby Special Forces come under the direct
                            control of the <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> in order to maximize
                            their impact on the conduct of the war. Somewhat heatedly, Col.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> stated that while there
                            were certain intelligence functions of his troops on which he reported
                            directly to the Presidency and Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, all other dispositions of his units are undertaken
                            with an “ordre de mission” issued by the Joint General Staff.</p>
                        <p>3. Col. <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> then asked if this
                            same control applied to the civilian Airborne Ranger or if the Civil
                            Guard companies [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>]. <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName>
                            replied that it was necessary to distinguish between military and
                            paramilitary forces, that while these latter forces were under the
                            general control of <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss>, they were used
                            in a more flexible manner as was agreed [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line not declassified</hi>] from the beginning.</p>
                        <p>4. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] repeated
                            that the civilian Airborne Ranger companies could not be supported
                            unless subordinated to <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> control. In
                            anger, <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> retorted that if
                                [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>], he would dissolve
                            them. When asked if he could do this of his own authority, he admitted
                            that he would have to get an order from the Presidency to do so.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> was questioned if he
                            would rather dissolve the civilian Rangers than place them under <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> control. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_SMGRG1">Stilwell</persName> indicated that there are
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> spaces for three additional
                            Special Forces companies and possibly these civilian Airborne Ranger
                            companies could be converted to <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            units. In a cooler vein Col. <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> stated that <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            recruitment might be possible if they would volunteer. He followed this
                            by insisting that the civilian Ranger companies as well as the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> Ranger companies are under <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> control.</p>
                        <p>5. After some further discussion, <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> was reminded that Gen. <persName corresp="#p_SMGRG1">Stilwell</persName> and the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] were under the instructions
                            of their government, that if there is some misunderstanding as to
                            control of the Special Forces units, this is possibly a matter which the
                                <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0452"/>President would wish to
                            take up with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>.
                            This was later reiterated and it is believed <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> understood that <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> control is not a matter for
                            negotiation.</p>

                            1963, <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> reported that he had
                            talked with <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> on the
                            afternoon of October 23 about the U.S. approach to coup planning against
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> confirmed that in his
                            conversation with General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> on
                            October 22 he had warned <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> of

                            officers. (See <ref target="#d206">Document 206</ref>.) According to
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> stated. that his purpose in
                            offering <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> the warning was to
                            discourage Vietnamese military officers from approaching U.S. officers
                            on political matters. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            stated that he reminded <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            of the guidance on coup planning that Washington had sent. (<ref target="#d192">Document 192</ref>) <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> responded, according to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, that he understood this
                            guidance to mean that the United States did not favor a coup. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> countered as follows:</p>
                        <p>“I explained that while it was true that the USG did not desire to
                            initiate a coup, we had instructions from the highest levels not to
                            thwart any change of government which gives promises of increasing the
                            effectiveness of the military effort, insuring popular support to win
                            the war, and improving working relations with the U.S.… General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> expressed regret if
                            he had inadvertently upset any delicate arrangements in progress and
                            added that he would inform General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> that his remarks of 22 October did not convey
                            official USG thinking.” (Kennedy Library, National Security Files,

                            <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> was understandably concerned
                            about the differing signals on coup planning which he was receiving from
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and Conein. He
                            arranged to meet Conein on the night of October 23 and during the
                            discussion expressed his worries to Conein. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> stated that <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' discouragement of a coup during the discussion
                            of October 22 seemed contrary to Conein's desire to know more about the
                            coup committee's planning. Conein assured <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' remarks had been inadvertent and were actually
                            contrary to a Presidential guidance from Washington. Conein asked again
                            for detailed plans of the coup. (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>

                                2 from Saigon, the Station reported it had contacted Pham Ngoc Thao
                                at 3 p.m. Iocal time at his home. Thao disclaimed any knowledge of a
                                coup scheduled for that day or the next few days. In Critic 3, the
                                Station reported that Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NCKLC1">Nguyen

                                conclude in Critic 4 from Saigon, that either the original report of

                        <p>2. Certain aspects of the <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>-Conein contacts give us considerable concern. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>'s reference (1) to a Presidential

                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, for which there was no

                            any real capabilities for action have been developed, all lead us to
                            wonder whether there may be danger <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> attempting entrapment through <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>'s approaches to Conein.</p>
                        <p>3. We wonder whether it is wise to risk continued involvement of Conein
                            in the dialogue with <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, since
                            not only might it destroy his usefulness, but might also involve you and

                            which is difficult to deny. Is it possible to arrange a more secure

                            cut-outs. We do feel quite strongly that you and Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> should stand back from any

                            Governor said Z was very much concerned that cutting aid off from troops
                            might affect war effort. Governor said he didn't know whether he could

                            I see the President personally to discuss some of the items. He agreed
                            but said it would be next week because of preparations for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> committee and the national holiday on the

                        <p>In the past two weeks two different officers in the advisory detachments
                            here in Saigon have been approached by Khuong asking if the U.S. would
                            back a coup. Khuong did not discuss any details of any plan. When these
                            U.S. officers came to me for guidance I told them to inform Col Khuong
                            that the U.S. military are here to advise and support the people and the
                            government in their fight against Communism-and it would be well if he,
                            Col Khuong, would bend his efforts along that line. I have never met
                            Khuong. I have seen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> several
                            times recently and at no time has he mentioned coup planning to me. Not
                            that he would. In fact all our conversations have been along lines of
                            furthering the war effort, ideas for carrying out some of your
                            suggestions to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-and items I
                            should put in another letter to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to continue plugging these ideas.</p>
                        <p>I told him not all of his officers had got the word and mentioned
                            Khuong's approaches to two of my advisors. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> was surprised and told me he thought he had stopped
                            all that. My purpose in this was to see if we couldn't avoid having
                            advisors distracted by matters which are not in their domain and which
                            only resulted in diverting them from their main effort as advisors.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> 1896 is the first indication to me
                            since your visit that the Generals group was again in business. Though I
                            am not trying to thwart a change in government, I think we should take a
                            good hard look at the group's proposals to see if we think it would be
                            capable of increasing the effectiveness of the military effort. There
                            are so many coup groups making noises. Unless elements of all are
                            included I'm afraid there will be a continuous effort to upset whoever
                            gains control for sometime out and this to me will interfere with the
                            war effort. Ambassador has seen.</p>

                        <p>According to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> telegram [<hi rend="italic">document number not declassified</hi>] from Saigon,
                            October 25, 1963, Conein and <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>
                            met on the night of October 24. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> stated that he could not now hand over to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> the coup committee's plans for
                            political organization as he had promised earlier. The coup committee
                            opposed such a move for reasons of security, but, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> continued, the committee would be
                            willing to show <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> all their
                            plans, both military and political, 2 days before the coup was to take
                            place. Conein reminded <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> that
                            the U.S. Government could make no commitment to the coup leaders until
                            it had studied their plans in detail. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> answered that the coup was planned for no later than
                            November 2 and again promised at least 2 days' notice. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> assured Conein that the new
                            Vietnamese government would be civilian, would free non-Communist
                            political prisoners, would allow honest elections, and would permit
                            complete religious freedom. The new government, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> added, would be pro-Western, but
                            would not be a vassal of the United States. (Kennedy Library, National

                        <p>1. I appreciate the concern expressed by you in Ref A<note n="2" xml:id="d216fn2">

                            clearing up some of the doubts relative to the Generals' plans, and I am
                            hopeful that the detailed plans promised for two days before the coup
                            attempt will clear up any remaining doubts.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> has been punctilious in carrying
                            out my instructions. I have personally approved each meeting between
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> and Conein who has
                            carried out my orders in each instance explicitly. <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0461"/>While I share your concern about the
                            continued involvement of Conein in this matter, a suitable substitute
                            for Conein as the principal contact is not presently available. Conein,
                            as you know, is a friend of some eighteen years' standing with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, and General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> has expressed extreme reluctance to
                            deal with anyone else. I do not believe the involvement of another
                            American in close contact with the Generals would be productive. We are,
                            however, considering the feasibility of a plan for the introduction of
                            an additional officer as a cut-out between Conein and a designee of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> for communication
                            purposes only. This officer is completely unwitting of any details of
                            past or present coup activities and will remain so.</p>
                        <p>3. With reference to General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' comment to General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> [in] which <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> reports to have referred to a Presidential directive
                            and the proposal for a meeting with me, this may have served the useful
                            purpose of allaying the Generals' fears as to our interest. If this were
                            a provocation, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could have
                            assumed and manufactured any variations of the same theme. As a
                            precautionary measure, however, I of course refused to see General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>. As to the lack of
                            information as to General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>'s
                            real backing, and the lack of evidence that any real capabilities for
                            action have been developed, Ref B provides only part of the answer. I
                            feel sure that the reluctance of the Generals to provide the United
                            States with full details of their plans at this time, is a reflection of
                            their own sense of security and a lack of confidence that in the large
                            American community present in Saigon their plans will not be prematurely
                            revealed.</p>
                        <p>4. The best evidence available to the Embassy, which I grant you is not
                            as complete as we would like it, is that General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> and the other Generals involved
                            with him are seriously attempting to effect a change in the government.
                            I do not believe that this is a provocation by <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>, although we shall
                            continue to assess the planning as well as possible. In the event that
                            the coup aborts, or in the event that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has masterminded a provocation, I believe that our
                            involvement to date through Conein is still within the realm of
                            plausible denial. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> is perfectly
                            prepared to have me disavow Conein at any time it may serve the national
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>5. I welcome your reaffirming instructions contained in <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Washington 74228.<note n="4" xml:id="d216fn4">
                                <ref target="#d192">Document 192</ref>.</note> It is vital that we
                            neither thwart a coup nor that we are even in a position where we do not
                            know what is going on.</p>
                        <p>6. We should not thwart a coup for two reasons. First, it seems at least
                            an even bet that the next government would not bungle and stumble as
                            much as the present one has. Secondly, it is extremely unwise in the
                            long range for us to pour cold water on attempts at a coup, particularly
                            when they are just in their beginning states. We <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0462"/>should remember that this is the only
                            way in which the people in Vietnam can possibly get a change of
                            government. Whenever we thwart attempts at a coup, as we have done in
                            the past, we are incurring very long lasting resentments, we are
                            assuming an undue responsibility for keeping the incumbents in office,
                            and in general are setting ourselves in judgment over the affairs of
                            Vietnam. Merely to keep in touch with this situation and a policy merely
                            limited to “not thwarting,” are courses both of which entail some risks
                            but these are lesser risks than either thwarting all coups while they
                            are stillborn or our not being informed of what is happening. All the
                            above is totally distinct from not wanting U.S. military advisors to be
                            distracted by matters which are not in their domain, with which I
                            heartily agree. But obviously this does not conflict with a policy of
                            not thwarting. In judging proposed coupe, we must consider the effect on
                            the war effort. Certainly a succession of fights for control of the
                            Government of Vietnam would interfere with the war effort. It must also
                            be said that the war effort has been interfered with already by the
                            incompetence of the present government and the uproar which this has
                            caused.</p>
                        <p>7. General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>'s intention to have
                            no religious discrimination in a future government is commendable and I
                            applaud his desire not to be “a vassal” of the U.S. But I do not think
                            his promise of a democratic election is realistic. This country simply
                            is not ready for that procedure. I would add two other requirements.
                            First, that there be no wholesale purges of personnel in the government.
                            Individuals who were particularly reprehensible could be dealt with
                            later by the regular legal process. Then I would suggest a cabinet
                            covering a very broad range. This may be impractical, but I am thinking
                            of a government which might include <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                Quang</persName> and which certainly should include men of the
                            stature of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu</persName>, the labor
                            leader.</p>

                            following more immediate issues:</p>

                        <p>a). You might express satisfaction that previously proposed and recently
                            reemphasized suggestion to remark corps boundaries, placing greater
                            emphasis on Delta, has been adopted by President, as well as suggestion
                            to place Special Forces elements operating in various Corps areas under
                            operational control of Corps Commanders, which we understand has been

                        <p>b). You might also wish explain further along lines para 9 <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 534, and elaboration <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 570,<note n="4" xml:id="d218fn4">See <ref target="#d198fn3">footnote 3, Document 198</ref>.</note>
                            reasons for our position that support must be withheld from those
                            airborne ranger and Civil Guard companies not responsive to <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> control.</p>
                        <p>c). With regard to military operations (as spelled out in <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> 2792, 051834Z)<note n="5" xml:id="d218fn5">See <ref target="#d181fn9">footnote 9, Document
                                    181</ref>.</note> our view is that military operations should
                            emphasize clear-and-hold instead of terrain sweeps of little permanent
                            value; that there should be expansion of personnel in combat in all
                            units to full authorized strength; and that training and arming of
                            hamlet militia should take place at an accelerated rate, especially in
                            the Delta.</p>
                        <p>d). With regard to the strategic hamlet program, we believe a
                            consolidation of this program in the Delta of special importance at this
                            time, as well as action to ensure that future strategic hamlets not be
                            built until they can be protected and until civic action programs can be
                            introduced.</p>
                        <p>2. It is highly desirable <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> treat
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mission in manner which will
                            insure that subsequent report, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            discussions and decision are as favorable as possible toward Republic
                            Vietnam. This approach to mission requires that it be permitted access
                            to all persons it desires to see. Also means that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should in its own interest avoid
                            raising any matters with mission either directly or indirectly which
                            could serve as pretext for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members to
                            deal with political issues relating to Vietnam such as reunification by
                            elections, neutralization, etc.</p>

                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could serve its own interest while
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mission present in Vietnam by
                            taking steps to release Buddhists and students remaining under arrest,
                            reopening all schools still closed and initiating action in National
                            Assembly for repeal Decree 10.</p>
                        <p>4. Anti-US public statements by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            officials (like <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>) and
                            slanderous articles in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-controlled
                            Times of Viet-Nam are poisoning atmosphere between US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and make cooperation in pursuit of our
                            effort increasingly difficult to maintain. This is particularly true in
                            the light of the fact that the U.S. Government has been extremely
                            careful in these last months to avoid this kind of comment with respect
                            to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>There may be other specific issues as well which you might find it
                            appropriate to raise.</p>
                        <p>We realize of course that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s
                            general mode of operation leaves little opportunity for his
                            interlocutors to bring up matters not of interest to him, and that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> may keep conversation
                            strictly on plane of interest to him without bringing up any topics
                            bearing on political relations between his government and US. But we
                            repeat that we do not wish to lose any opportunity of pressing our
                            position upon him, and this meeting looks like one of the best chances
                            we have had.</p>

                        <p>MACJ234</p>
                        <p>Dear Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>: I am
                            increasingly concerned over the continued, and probably accelerating,
                            utilization by the Viet Cong of Cambodian territory. Heavier and more
                            sophisticated Sino/Soviet Bloc weapons are turning up in the Delta and
                            elsewhere in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. History points up the
                            indispensable role of neighboring friendly territories for resupply and
                            communications points in connection with insurgent warfare. Mines,
                            grenades and demolition charges are being detonated in the Republic of
                            Vietnam filled with explosive materials brought in from Cambodia.
                            Prisoner of War interrogations relate in considerable detail the
                            activities and movements of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> personnel
                                <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0466"/>shuttling between Cambodia
                            and <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. The Watch Committee in
                            Washington recently reaffirmed all this on 17 October 1963, stating in
                            part, “that cumulative evidence . …<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2">Ellipsis
                                in the source text.</note> makes it clear that the Viet Cong are
                            continuing to use Cambodian territory as a base of operations, sanctuary
                            and support area.” <note n="3" xml:id="d219fn3">The Watch Committee
                                report of October 17 has not been found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I feel that a new effort to control and as far as possible
                            eliminate <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity in Cambodia is
                            mandatory. This would include closing off the infiltration pipeline, and
                            shutting down the Viet Cong bases in Cambodia. Failure to take positive
                            action in this respect could prolong the current war in the Republic of
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Though I appreciate this is primarily a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-Cambodia issue, I feel there are some military measures
                            that should be given consideration (we can assist in some) such as:</p>
                        <p>a. Permit photo reconnaissance flights on the Cambodian side of the
                            border.</p>
                        <p>b. Relax current restrictions on clandestine intelligence operations
                            across the border in Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>c. Institute a “hot pursuit” policy authorizing ground forces in contact
                            with the Viet Cong to pursue enemy units across the border. This
                            permission should extend to pursuit of Cambodian forces found violating
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> territory.</p>
                        <p>d. Impose rigid inspectional controls on Cambodian use of the Mekong
                            River in attempting to prevent the introduction of hostile personnel and
                            contraband into the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>One of our main difficulties has been the collection of hard
                            intelligence, and implementation of the above should go a long way
                            toward providing more of the answers, as well as contributing toward an
                            improved operational situation.</p>
                        <p>In summary, I cannot help but be disturbed over the present situation in
                            Cambodia from a military point of view. The flow of weapons and
                            ammunition coming from there, and the continued <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> use of that territory for recuperation, regroupment and
                            resupply should not be permitted.</p>
                        <p>I appreciate that this is a difficult diplomatic task to accomplish.
                            However, I feel we should continue in our efforts in the hope we can
                            make some gain-even though small, in effecting more rigid control of the
                            border.</p>

                        <p>804. Eyes only Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. On Monday<note n="2" xml:id="d220fn2">October 28.</note> after the
                            atomic energy lunch <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> spoke
                            to me about my day with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>,
                            inferring that he had been instrumental in arranging it. He said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had had elaborate
                            studies made about what steps they could take without our aid and all
                            had concluded that without our aid they could not go on.</p>
                        <p>2. I told him that after a long and frustrating conversation in which not
                            one single specific idea of mine had been accepted, I finally asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> if he could think of
                            some one thing which was within the range of his possibilities, which he
                            would be willing to do and which could reassure US public opinion. He
                            had said nothing.</p>
                        <p>3. When <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> asked what sort of
                            thing I would want, I said that I could illustrate it by such things as
                            liberating the prisoners (Buddhists and others); opening the schools;
                            eliminating the discriminatory features of Decree Law No. 10; and
                            concealing nothing from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Commission, so as to put Vietnam in a good light with regard to world
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>4. I said that the trouble between Vietnam and the United States was
                            largely one of public relations. We are a government in which public
                            opinion is extremely important. I realized that they were accustomed to
                            an authoritarian government; still, two such different governments
                            should be able to work together on specific matters.</p>
                        <p>5. I hoped that we could get this thing out of the papers for awhile,
                            which is why I had advised that the Nhus disappear for awhile.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> then said: Well, you
                            don't ask for much, I must say. He added: Of course, the President must
                            save face.</p>
                        <p>7. I said that nobody, not even the Americans, likes to be put in the
                            position of supporting totalitarian acts which are totally contrary to
                            our way of thinking.</p>
                        <p>8. He asked me whether he could say to President that without some step
                            by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> he felt sure American attitude
                            would harden. I said that I would rather say that without some step by
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> he could see no change in
                            present American attitude.</p>
                        <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0468"/>
                        <p>9. The conversation ended with <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> saying that my conversation with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was “perhaps a
                            beginning”.</p>

                        <p>805. Eyes only Secretary. Bangkok exclusive for <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. Herewith report of my day with President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, Sunday, October 27.</p>
                        <p>2. We left Saigon [garble—and flew?] to Phuoc Long from where we flew for
                            about 20 minutes by helicopter to Dao Nghia Plantation Center where we
                            had lunch. We then flew over the Province of Quang Duc to Dalat.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was at his best,
                            describing the public improvements that he had put into effect. He was
                            constantly saying, “I did this” and “I did that”. He appears deeply
                            interested in agriculture and in developing the country. When we were in
                            the helicopter, because of the noise, he was continually writing
                            messages on a large block of paper describing what we were seeing. He is
                            very likeable. One feels that he is a nice, good man who living a good
                            life by his own lights, but who also feels that he is a man who is cut
                            off from present, who is living in the past, who is truly indifferent to
                            people as such and who is simply unbelievably stubborn.</p>
                        <p>3. After leaving Saigon, the President mentioned the fact that at one
                            time <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss> had planned to build
                            another university in Vietnam. This gave me an opportunity to discuss
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commission. I asked him whether he
                            had seen them. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said that he
                            had. I said that I knew two members of it well and one slightly. I was
                            sure that at least one of them was going to ask me to let him talk with
                                <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>. I said that my
                            answer would be that I would not allow anyone to see <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> without the request of the
                            Government of Vietnam, but I strongly advised him to give his permission
                            because it would help Vietnam in the United Nations if the Commission
                            could say that he had at no time prevented them from seeing anything or
                            talking to anybody whom they wanted. He said nothing but looked
                            provoked.</p>
                        <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0469"/>
                        <p>After a pause, he said that he supposed I knew that <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> had been communicating with
                            the outside world and that he had dropped some papers out the window
                            onto the street. I said that I found this hard to believe because there
                            were no windows in the room in which he was living and even if he went
                            along the gallery to go to the men's room, he still was nowhere near the
                            street.</p>
                        <p>4. After a sumptuous Vietnamese dinner, he suddenly stopped talking about
                            the events of the past and said, in a casual rather supercilious tone,
                            that he would like to know whether we were going to suspend the
                            commercial imports payments or whether we were going to stop. He said it
                            as though it were a matter of indifference to him. I had at no time
                            brought this up or done anything to make it easy for him to do so. </p>
                        <p>5. I said I did not know, but asked what he intended to do if our policy
                            did change. Would he open the schools, would he liberate the Buddhists
                            and others who were in prison, would he eliminate the discriminatory
                            features of Decree Law Number 10? </p>
                        <p>6. He said that the schools had been gradually opened, that they were all
                            open in Hue, that the Buddhists were being liberated and that changing
                            Decree Law 10 was very complicated and up to the Assembly, that he had
                            no authority. </p>
                        <p>7. He then attacked American activities in Vietnam. He spoke particularly
                            about an American [less than 1 line not declassified] who had talked to
                            people in the Vietnamese Government about threats which had been made to
                            assassinate me and that the 7th Fleet would come in if such a thing
                            happened. He said that Communist documents had also been found
                            discussing a coup on October 23 and 24 which also involved the 7th
                            Fleet. He said that the assassination story had been started to poison
                            my mind, that anyone who knew him knew that my safety was an essential
                            preoccupation of his. I said I had total confidence that he did not want
                            me to be assassinated, but that these rumors were constantly being
                            brought to me. I also pointed out that there had been no coup on October
                            23 and 24.</p>
                        <p>8. He said that <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName>, the head
                            of <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, was printing tracts against
                            the government and giving equipment to opponents of the government so
                            that they could print tracts and that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was intriguing against the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>9. I said: Give me proof of improper action by any employee of the US
                            Government and I will see that he leaves Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>10. He then said that we must get on with the war against the
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>11. I said I agreed but we must consider US opinion; we wanted to be
                            treated as equal partners; we do not want Vietnam to be a satellite of
                            ours; nor do we want to be a satellite of Vietnam's. We do not wish to
                            be put in the extremely embarrassing position of condoning totalitarian
                                <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0470"/>acts which are against our
                            traditions and ideals. Repeatedly I asked him: What do you propose to do
                            for us? His reply several times was either a blank stare or change of
                            subject or the statement: “je ne vais pas servir”, which makes no sense.
                            He must have meant to say “ceder” rather than “servir”, meaning: “I will
                            not give in.” He warned that the Vietnamese people were strange people
                            and could do odd things if they were resentful.</p>
                        <p>12. I said many things happen which made it hard for us. In our
                            newspapers we read of newspapermen being beaten up (as they were on
                            October 5);<note n="2" xml:id="d221fn2">While covering an act of
                                self-immolation by a Buddhist bonze at the circle in front of the
                                Saigon Market, three American news correspondents, John Starkey and
                                Grant Wolfhill of <gloss target="#t_NBC1">NBC</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_HD1">David Halberstam</persName> of The New York
                                Times, were attacked and beaten by plainclothes Vietnamese policemen
                                who sought to prevent them from taking photographs of the suicide.
                                (Telegram 637 from Saigon, October 5; ibid., SOC 14-1 <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss> VIET) See also Mecklin, <hi rend="italic">Mission in Torment</hi>, pp. 242-243. </note> of
                            bonzes burning; of children being taken off to concentration points in
                            US trucks.</p>
                        <p>13. He said newspapermen shouldn't go into the center of a riot, they
                            could expect to get beaten. </p>
                        <p>14. I said you don't get anywhere in the US by beating up newspapermen.
                            He said I will not give in.</p>
                        <p>15. I said you wanted us to do something for you, what can you do for us?
                            Ours is a government of public opinion. Public opinion is already so
                            critical that I thought that if the Church resolution came to a vote
                            there would be too many votes against Vietnam. I was glad that it was
                            arranged to leave the decision on aid to Vietnam up to the President.
                            But the President himself could not fly in the face of a totally adverse
                            public opinion and the bad publicity coming out of Vietnam could make it
                            hard for the President.</p>
                        <p>16. He said the US press is full of lies. He then changed the subject and
                            talked about the impropriety of our allowing former Ambassador Chuong to
                            speak.</p>
                        <p>17. I said there was free speech in America and anybody could say
                            whatever he wanted.</p>
                        <p>18. He said there was a practice against letting a former Ambassador
                            attack his own country in the country in which he had been Ambassador.
                            This is clearly something for which Vietnam could be indemnified
                            (edomommageable).</p>
                        <p>19. He then spoke about brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> who he said was so good and so quiet, so
                            conciliatory and so compromising.</p>
                        <p>20. I said I would not debate this point and it might be that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had been treated unfairly
                            in the press of the world but a fact is a fact and the fact is that Mr.
                            and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> have had extremely
                            bad publicity. <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0471"/>This is why I
                            had advised a period of silence for both of them. It is still hard for
                            me to understand why Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            felt she had to talk so much.</p>
                        <p>21. He said she had had more than 100 invitations. </p>
                        <p>22. I said yes, but they had not come from the US Government.</p>
                        <p>23. He said the press does not print what Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> says. The whole concert of lies is
                            orchestrated by the State Department. </p>
                        <p>24. I said the government does not control the press in America. It is
                            basically a free commercial press. When there is something sensational
                            to report, an American newspaper is going to report it or else it will
                            cease to be a newspaper. The way to stop the publicity is for Madame
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to stop talking.</p>
                        <p>25. He said that Ambassador Chuong's older daughter in Washington was
                            “acting like a prostitute”, that she “scandalized Georgetown” and “even
                            jumped on priests”. To this I made no comment.</p>
                        <p>26. Somewhat to my surprise he brought up the Times of Vietnam (which I
                            had not done) and said that he realized that perhaps it had been a
                            little bit inaccurate concerning the departure of <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Rufus Phillips</persName> which he understood was
                            in fact due to the fact that his father was sick. I said that I was sure
                                <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName>' father was sick,
                            but I also said that the Times of Vietnam was constantly slandering the
                            US, printing things which were totally untrue, such as the story the
                            other day that [the Embassy?] allowed the American Congressional
                            delegation and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to visit <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                Quang</persName>. Neither of these things were true. But here again
                            he would never admit any of my statements about the inaccuracy of the
                            Times of Vietnam concerning the US.</p>
                        <p>27. At the end of the conversation he said with a sigh I realize I made a
                            great mistake in leaving such a gap in Washington, meaning that if he
                            had had another kind of Ambassador, the press and the politicians could
                            have been cultivated so that Vietnam would not now find itself with such
                            unfavorable public opinion.</p>
                        <p>28. When it was evident that the conversation was practically over, I
                            said: Mr. President, every single specific suggestion which I have made,
                            you have rejected. Isn't there some one thing you may think of that is
                            within your capabilities to do and that would favorably impress US
                            opinion. As on other previous occasions when I asked him similar
                            questions, he gave me a blank look and changed the subject.</p>
                        <p>29. Although the conversation was frustrating and long-drawnout, the tone
                            was always courteous and restrained. I am convinced that we have
                            persuaded him of one thing: That the state of US opinion is very bad
                            from his viewpoint. For a man who is as cut off as he is, this is
                            something. Perhaps the conversation will give him food for thought and
                            perhaps the conversation marks a beginning. But taken by itself, if does
                            not offer much hope that it is going to change. </p>
                        <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0472"/>
                        <p>30. The US Government should, however, make up its mind as to what it
                            would regard as an adequate action by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on which to base a resumption of commercial imports.
                            Thuan thinks we will be hearing from him again.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. At the direction of General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> I called on Representative Zablocki to discuss
                            his Vietnam visit.<note n="2" xml:id="d222fn2">See <ref target="#d181fn8">footnote 8, Document 181</ref>.</note> He
                            stated that his views would ultimately be expressed in writing but, in
                            advance of the written report,<note n="3" xml:id="d222fn3">H. Rept. 893,
                                88th Cong., 1st Sess., November 7, 1963.</note> that he would be
                            glad to summarize them orally, generally as recounted below.</p>
                        <p>2. He began by saying that his group included several members who left
                            the US with a preconception that the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime must be liquidated, while others went to
                            Vietnam with an open mind. All returned, after 3-1/2 days in-country,
                            with about the same convictions; specifically that:</p>
                        <p>a. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, with all his faults, his
                            autocracy, his tolerance of venality and brutality, is durable, and has
                            been winning.</p>
                        <p>b. There is no visible substitute for <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>—at least none which guarantees improvement; thus,
                            actions by US representatives to join with coup plotters, as was
                            apparently true in August, is harmful.</p>
                        <p>c. The conduct of the resident US press is a grave reflection upon their
                            entire profession. They are arrogant, emotional, unobjective and
                            ill-informed. The case against them is best expressed by their having
                            been repudiated by much of the responsible US press.</p>
                        <p>d. He has serious doubts as to the efficacy of our commodity import
                            suspension, in that he fears it will shake the confidence of the common
                            people, inspire inflation and affect the war effort adversely. He is, at
                            the same time, in full sympathy with the suspensions related to the
                            Vietnamese special forces.</p>
                        <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0473"/>
                        <p>e. He is favorably impressed with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>; believes he is attacking a most difficult task
                            with sincerity, tenacity and vigor. He is likewise favorably impressed
                            with General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and his
                            energetic approach to winning the war. He spoke unfavorably concerning
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName>, in terms of their defeatist and
                            anti-Diemist attitudes, although he did not explain how he reached this
                            judgement in such a brief time.</p>
                        <p>f. He believes that intensified operations against North Vietnam are an
                            essential to early termination of the war; that <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>'s truce noises should be a
                            signal for more pressure on him.</p>
                        <p>3. The Zablocki group visited the Delta and, by his account, were
                            favorably impressed by the morale and enthusiasm of both the US and
                            Vietnamese military. Someone had obviously told him of General Cao's
                            tactical weaknesses, which he recounted accurately. He also observed
                            that we should not lose sight, in our impatience to see the Delta war
                            ended, that neither the French nor the Vietnamese had ever been able to
                            establish much of a presence there; that it is indeed a hard
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>4. At the end of the conversation—in which he did most of the talking-I
                            noted that he had not mentioned the Buddhist problem. He then
                            characterized it as a political matter, said we probably have as much
                            religious discrimination in the US as there is in Vietnam, and compared
                            the number of Roman Catholics in our own high government circles with
                            the situation in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>5. I asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> might have the
                            favor of an advance copy of his report. He assented, but avoided saying
                            when it might be complete. From remarks made by one of his secretaries I
                            reached the conclusion that they are shooting for this weekend.</p>

                        <p>I believe that we have sufficient evidence to demonstrate the
                            effectiveness of herbicide operations. It has been demonstrated that the
                            cost in adverse propaganda is relatively low. I agree that present <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0475"/>approval procedures are too
                            slow. I believe more effort should be made to improve the civic action
                            aspects of this operation and that reimbursements for accidental damage
                            should be paid promptly. More emphasis should be put on non-chemical
                            defoliation.</p>

                            out and asked me whether Conein was authorized to speak for me. I said
                            that he was. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> then said that
                            whatever was done must be thoroughly Vietnamese and that the U.S. should
                            not interfere or try to stimulate a coup.</p>
                        <p>3. I said that I agreed; the U.S. wanted no satellites; we would not
                            thwart. I asked how soon action could be expected. He said, we are not
                            ready yet. He then added: Army has lost its drive (in French “allant”);
                            we must win before you Americans leave. We cannot do it with this
                            government, we must, therefore, get a government with which we can win

                        <p>1. By prearrangement and at Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>'s initiative, Col Conein met Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line

                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> stated that he had talked
                            to Amb <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and that <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> had vouched for Conein.<note n="2" xml:id="d225fn2">See <ref target="#d224">Document 224</ref>. </note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> emphasized that he had told
                            Amb <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> that he and his group
                            had no political ambitions, that their only desire was to win the war
                            against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and re-establish the
                            prestige of Vietnam and the Army. He stated flatly the only way to win
                            before the Americans leave in 1965 was to change the present regime.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> indicated he was
                            completely satisfied at Conein's bona fides as were the other members of
                            the Generals' coup committee.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> added that he and his
                            fellow Generals wished to do everything possible to avoid American
                            involvement in the coup. He stated emphatically that other Americans
                            should quit talking to Colonels and Majors about coup action since in
                            this way, Americans will involve themselves despite any discretion on
                            the part of the Generals. Conein asked for specifics on this point.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> replied merely he
                            recognized Conein to be the proper contact on the American side and the
                            Americans should recognize him as the proper contact on the Vietnamese
                            side. All other dealings on the subject of coup action between Americans
                            and Vietnamese should cease. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>
                            would not be more specific.</p>
                        <p>5. Explaining that he was speaking on his own initiative and without
                            instructions (this had previously been cleared with the Ambassador),
                            Conein called to <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>'s attention
                            the fact that the Amb would be leaving for a brief trip to the United
                            States on 31 Oct, that it might prove important both to Vietnamese and
                            American considerations of this question should Amb <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> have a complete grasp of the
                            Generals' planning prior to his departure. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> repeated that Amb <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> would have the plans before the coup but when
                            pressed on his previous commitment to make these plans available 48
                            hours in advance, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> stated that
                            possibly the plans could only be made available 4 hours in advance.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> questioned Conein closely
                            as to what time on t<pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0477"/>he 31st the
                            Amb would be leaving. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> added
                            that he hoped the Amb would not change his schedule, as any change might
                            be suspect. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> stated nothing
                            would be happening within the next 48 hours and that, if there was a
                            good reason for the Amb to change his planning, the Amb would be
                            informed in time to make his own decision. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> added that he would be leaving on the morning of 29
                            Oct to see Gen Do Cao Tri and General <persName corresp="#p_NKMG1">Nguyen Khanh</persName>, that the cover for this trip would be the
                            distribution of medals. Actually, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> would be talking to <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            to perfect the planning. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>
                            asked Conein to remain at home from Wednesday<note n="3" xml:id="d225fn3">October 30.</note> evening onward.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">Numbered paragraph 6 (6 lines) not

                        <p>7. Conein recalled to <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> the
                            latter's previous mention of Lt Col Pham Ngoc Thao. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said to beware of Thao since he is
                            not above fabrication and is suspect by the Generals' group. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> added that Thao is a protege of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT1">Ngo Dinh Thuc</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, that likewise Thao is under
                            suspicion by Col <persName corresp="#p_DMC1">Do Mau</persName>, Chief of
                            the MSS. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> added that even Gen
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is suspected by the
                            President as not being entirely loyal.</p>
                        <p>8. Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> was again questioned
                            about the participation of Gen <persName corresp="#p_TTDMG1">Ton That
                                Dinh</persName> in the coup planning. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> repeated that <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> is not participating in the planning, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> is under suspicion by
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>, with whom

                            Military Governor of Saigon. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>
                            reiterated that Gen <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> is
                            continuously surrounded by coup committee sympathizers and these persons
                            have been given orders to eliminate <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> if he shows any signs of compromising the coup.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> was pressed to reveal
                            details of the units participating in the coup. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said that this was not his specific
                            function within the coup committee and therefore he could not answer the
                            question with precision. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>
                            outlined his function as the contact man with the Americans, other

                        <p>D. Some units of the Presidential Guard plus at least four tanks.</p>

                        <p>10. Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said that he was
                            unaware of the position of the 7th Division<note n="4" xml:id="d225fn4">In <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Station telegram [<hi rend="italic">document number not declassified</hi>] from
                                Saigon, October 30, the position of the Seventh Division was
                                corrected as follows: “A review of Conein's notes indicates that the
                                coup group can count on two regiments of that division. This agrees
                                with our prior estimate that the bulk of the Seventh can be counted
                                on.” (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 26 <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss> VIET)</note> but
                            did not know that neither the Navy nor the Special Forces are involved
                            in any way. He said likewise the 135th Regiment was not involved. He
                            indicated some possibility that the combat police and other elements of
                            the National Police in Saigon might join in after the coup begins. He
                            could not give an opinion with respect to the 46th and 48th Territorial
                            Regiments. He emphasized that he was not doing the military
                            planning.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> volunteered that Gen
                                <persName corresp="#p_TTKG1">Tran Thien Khiem</persName> was being
                            very circumspect at the moment because he knows he is under suspicion by
                            the President.</p>
                        <p>12. The only additional details that <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> could offer were:</p>
                        <p>A. Command post for the coup will be the <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss>. This was chosen because of its proximity to Special
                            Forces headquarters and Tan Son Nhut.</p>
                        <p>B. The Generals are aware that there are two underground tunnels of
                            escape from Gia Long Palace. These terminate at the cemetery at the
                            corner of Phung Khoc Khoan and Phan Thanh Gian and at the zoo. These
                            were formerly part of the sewers but the sewerage has been diverted into
                            other channels.</p>
                        <p>C. At the moment of the initiation of the coup, <gloss target="#t_PTT1">PTT</gloss> will be taken and phones cut off.</p>
                        <p>13. In closing, Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said that
                            he would be in contact again within 48 hours, utilizing the new system
                            outlined by Conein. He pleaded that the Amb not alert the American
                            community in any way, specifically that Americans not be told to stock
                            up on food since that would be an instant alert to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>1. I have reviewed the following factors which appear to me to be
                            particularly relevant in a balanced examination of the positive and
                            negative forces affecting the chances of a successful coup d'etat:</p>
                        <p>A. Of immediate concern is the apparent lack of detail furnished by
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> both with regard to
                            the military units to be involved and the politico/psywar side. This
                            appears to me to be at least in part explained by the Generals'
                            reticence to reveal these details at this point and because of what must
                            be a much greater regard for security than was the case in August. The
                            Generals also acknowledge a certain amount of compartmentation and
                            division of labor among the principals which on balance should work to
                            our advantage. </p>
                        <p>B. The acknowledged involvement of General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> is an extremely variable factor. The Generals seem
                            acutely aware of this and <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>
                            states that they have him under 24-hour a day surveillance and are
                            prepared to neutralize him at any time should he kick over the
                            traces.</p>
                        <p>C. The possibility of a premature, unrelated and precipitate coup by Col
                            Pham Ngoc Thao or others looms large as a negative factor. Again, the
                            Generals appear completely aware of this and as you know, we have never
                            been particularly sanguine that Thao has this capability.</p>
                        <p>D. Knowledge of the involvement of certain civilian opposition elements,
                            notably <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bui Diem</persName>, who has stated
                            that he is liaison between General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> and civilian leaders, probably Dang Van Sung and
                                <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Phan Huy Quat</persName>, represents
                            both a positive and negative factor. On the negative side, it represents
                            an extension of knowledge weakening the security element but on the
                            positive side, it indicates an awareness of the necessity of civilian
                            political inclusion and the fact that as <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> has stated it is not intended to establish a
                            military junta. Tran Trung Dung's knowledge and probable involvement
                            despite his disclaimer, further indicates intention to form civilian
                            government, probably within frame of reference of constitutional
                            succession. </p>
                        <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0480"/>
                        <p>E. I am disturbed over the reported discussion of Col <persName corresp="#p_NKC1">Nguyen Khuong</persName>'s approaches to U.S.
                            military personnel without the authorization of the coup principals. It
                            should be remembered that Khuong's role was obscure in the August coup
                            activities. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> has stated that
                            the coup principals would discipline Khuong and that he has been removed
                            from the scene.</p>
                        <p>F. It would seem to me that the existence of an imminent coup atmosphere
                            would reduce the element of surprise necessary for the successful
                            implementation of a coup d'etat. This coup atmosphere has pertained,
                            however, for several months which would tend to reduce the state of
                            readiness for countering such a coup attempt. We have some information
                            that counter-coup combat elements have been suborned. The fact that the
                            coup principals remain as the responsible military authority enhances
                            both their knowledge and ability to dispose the units both for and
                            against. </p>
                        <p>2. Additional factors which should be noted are:</p>
                        <p>A. To date the Generals have not indicated either a desire for or
                            dependence on our support or actions for successful implementation of a
                            coup. On the contrary, the Generals have repeatedly demanded the least
                            possible American involvement.</p>
                        <p>B. Although we are well aware of the profundity of student and Buddhist
                            dissidence and unrest and even ability to undertake certain limited
                            action, we do not know of any plans to utilize these elements and of
                            course cannot calculate the extent of spontaneous action they might
                            undertake. </p>
                        <p>C. Action taken with respect to the Commercial Import Program and the
                            severance of support and certain elements under Col <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> have created a coup atmosphere
                            and some deterioration in the economic situation characterized by the
                            fluctuation of the piastre value, the disappearance of gold on the
                            market, and the rising prices of consumer commodities. </p>
                        <p>D. Please note <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> does not want
                            me to change date of my departure for Washington. We are reviewing whole
                            situation Wednesday night to see whether change my departure is
                            justified. </p>
                        <p>3. A point which must be completely understood is that we are not
                            engineering the coup. The sum total of our relationship thus far is:
                            that we will not thwart a coup; that we will monitor and report; and
                            that Conein's long-standing friendship with <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> may be a real help. Although there have been no
                            requests to date by the Generals for material or financial support, we
                            must anticipate that such requests may be forthcoming. </p>
                        <p>4. In summary, it would appear that a coup attempt by the Generals' group
                            is imminent; that whether this coup fails or succeeds, the USG must be
                            prepared to accept the fact that we will be blamed, however
                            unjustifiably; and finally, that no positive action by the USG <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0481"/>can prevent a coup attempt
                            short of informing <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> with all the opprobrium
                            that such an action would entail. Note too <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>'s statement we will only have four hours notice.
                            This rules out my checking with you between time I learn of coup and
                            time that it starts. It means U.S. will not be able significantly to
                            influence course of events.</p>

                            and policies of a new govt than with personalities. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] remarked that structure,

                            top level. Dung said apparently Generals planned the complete removal of
                            the Ngo family.</p>
                        <p>2. Dung said that to his knowledge Generals had not yet approached
                            civilian leaders. As he has previously, Dung expressed some concern
                            about capabilities and intentions Generals. He considers majority <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0484"/>of Generals no more than French
                            trained sergeants in Generals' uniforms. Dung noted three exceptions

                                <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>, and Pham Xuan Chieu.
                            Dung said his concern re Generals was development of military junta and,
                            although regime must be replaced, Generals lacked necessary political

                            was necessary and fact he married to Diem niece may harm new grouping.

                            coup planning on civilian side. This based on following: Dung initial

                            leader candidates. On other hand, nothing Dung <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0485"/>said proves he personally involved or
                            has been approached, especially since what he said follows logical line

                        <p>3. Airborne Brigade—2550 in Saigon area. One-half of brigade with coup

                        <p>6. Air Force—2812 in Saigon area. All with coup group.</p>
                        <p>7. Navy—2200 in Saigon area. Presumably with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> as not involved with coup group.</p>
                        <p>8. 5th Division—hq. at Bien Hoa about 20 miles from Saigon. All with
                            coup.</p>
                        <p>9. 7th Division—hq. at My Tho south of Saigon. Position on coup
                            unknown.</p>
                        <p>10. 9th Division—newly moved to Delta from Central Viet-Nam. With coup
                            after it starts.</p>
                        <p>11. 21st Division—hq. deep in Delta. All with coup.</p>
                        <p>12. 23rd Division—hq. at Benmethnot in Central Plateau, about 200 miles
                            from Saigon. Half with coup.</p>
                        <p>13. 22nd, 25th, 2nd and 1st Divisions—all far removed from Saigon in
                            Central Viet-Nam. No information on their position.</p>
                        <p>14. 135th Territorial Regiment—hq. in Saigon. Not involved in coup
                            plan-presumably not contacted.</p>

                            before independence and anti-Diem since. The group is generally

                            considerable respect for Quat, but the latter has consistently refused

                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bui Diem</persName> is a much younger Dai
                            Viet leader, who has for several years been one of the few

                            obviously required.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> Since the U.S. may not receive
                            coup plans until 4 hours before the event, there may not be sufficient
                            time for a U.S. decision to be made.</p>
                        <p>In any case, we do not believe the U.S. should at this late stage attempt
                            to thwart a coup for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>(a) <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> has told the coup group
                            repeatedly, either directly or through Conein, that we would not thwart
                            a coup.</p>
                        <p>(b) This is the best chance for a successful coup we are likely to
                            have.</p>
                        <p>(c) Any attempt to thwart now would leave a great legacy of bitterness
                            and distrust on the part of the Generals toward the U.S.</p>
                        <p>(d) While there is, of course, considerable risk in connection with a
                            coup and no absolute guarantee of success, any other course of action or
                            inaction involves risks equally as great or greater.</p>

                            evacuation. On the other hand, movement of U.S. forces may tip off the

                            appears to have at least a preponderance of the forces. Since it does

                        <p>I think it would be a wise precaution at the end of this meeting to ask
                            that one copy of all important separate instructions and reports made on
                            any channel—State, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>,

                            next period for your personal information.</p>
                        <p>My object here is to provide a check on the tone of voice of policy-level
                            messages in these tense periods. There is just no doubt at all that a
                            good deal of our trouble in the last three months has come from
                            differences of emphasis, at least, in what we have said to the field. It
                            is pointlessly cumbersome to inhibit the dispatch of business by
                            requiring interdepartmental clearance on everything, but the existence
                            of a single information copy of everything important for you over here
                            will allow <persName corresp="#p_MM2">Mike</persName> and me to call to
                            your attention any serious divergences.</p>
                        <p>In requesting such a single information copy, you would be safe in saying
                            that in no case would any such copy be given any additional circulation
                            without direct notice from you to the agency concerned.</p>
                        <p>I do not underestimate the sensitivity of this order. <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>,
                            and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> particularly feel that they have
                            a right to communication downward that is not monitored from above. But
                            your interest is not served by the uncritical acceptance of that
                            right.</p>

                            He estimated that the pro-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            and anti-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> forces were about
                            even, approximately 9800 on each side, with 18,000 listed as neutral.
                            The briefing was illustrated with a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            order of battle map.<note n="2" xml:id="d234fn2">Not found. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName>'s record of this
                                conference contains a more complete treatment of <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName>'s briefing as follows: <p>“Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> opened with an
                                    intelligence assessment of the lineup of forces pro-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and pro-coup. He
                                    indicated this assessment was not based on the information from
                                    General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> just received
                                    by cable, but rather on an overall <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> assessment of available information. He said
                                    that the pro and anti <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces
                                    in Saigon number about the same on each side: 9,800. There are
                                    also about 18,000 forces in the Saigon area which can be
                                    classified as neutral. Of the key elements, he listed the
                                    Presidential guard, the special forces, and the armor unit in
                                    the Saigon area as pro-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>,
                                    except for one element of the Presidential guard He listed
                                    airborne, air force and some parts of the Marine forces as
                                    anti-palace. In response to the President's question, he stated
                                    that the only change since August is that two Marine units have
                                    moved over to the palace side.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> said that there
                                    are two main categories of coup groups: (1) Can Lao dissidents;
                                    and (2) the Generals. There is some contact between these two
                                    main categories, but not very much.”</p>

                        <p>The President asked what <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had
                            learned from the attempted coup in 1960. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> now had much better communications with military
                            forces deployed outside Saigon. He could thus call into Saigon rapidly
                            loyal forces to oppose rebel forces in the city. The 1960 coup was
                            frustrated when forces outside Saigon remained loyal, moved into Saigon,
                            and defeated the forces which had surrounded the palace.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> suggested that
                            the assessment just given the group be sent to Saigon to see if our
                            officials there agreed with it. He asked whether Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> should return to Washington now
                            and mentioned that some of those present felt he should stay in
                            Saigon.</p>
                        <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0495"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said we must assume
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> have heard rumors about a coup. The
                            question for us is whether we think there is enough prospect of a
                            successful coup to make the decision to keep silent. Should we let the
                            coup Generals know that a protracted civil war must not be the result of
                            their efforts to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>?
                            Should we tell them we would support them only if the coup is short and
                            bloodless? If fighting between the two sides takes place, each will ask
                            for our help. If we support <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, then we will disrupt the war effort because we will be
                            acting against those Generals who are now fighting the war against the
                            Viet Cong. If we support the rebel Generals, then we will have to
                            guarantee that they are successful in overthrowing the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government.</p>

                            General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> to stick to his
                            departure plan so <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> should
                            go ahead as he had planned. We now have little information. We need 48,
                            not 4, hours advance notice of any coup. We should put our faith in no
                            one, including General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>. We
                            should caution the Generals that they must have the situation in hand
                            before they launch a coup. We should tell them we have no interest
                            whatsoever in a long civil war in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> should leave Saigon for Washington as he had
                            planned. He thought the rebel Generals should talk to General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>. He said the odds were against
                            a coup. He suggested that General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> be put in charge of our mission in Saigon when
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> leaves. If
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> delays his
                            departure, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will know we are
                            aware of coup plans. It would be good to have Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> out of the country when a coup
                            takes place.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the estimate that the pro- and anti-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> forces are evenly balanced, the
                            President commented that it always looks this way until the coup
                            actually begins. Then support for the coup is forthcoming, as was
                            apparent, for example, in Korea.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> cautioned against
                            looking at the Vietnam situation as if it were a football game. He said
                            a few key people are crucial to the success of a coup and are more
                            important than total numbers.</p>
                        <p>The President asked that we try to find out who these key people are.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked who of
                            our officials in Saigon are in charge of the coup planning. He suggested
                            that the Deputy Chief of Mission, <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName>, the Acting Chief of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 1ine not
                                declassified</hi>], and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> form a group which would (a) jointly decide on
                            what our agent Conein would say and do and (b) hear all of Conein's
                            reports. If any of the three disagree, a report would be sent back to
                            Washington at once. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> may not know what the Embassy and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> are now doing. <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> should <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0496"/>head the Vietnamese country team until
                            the coup was initiated. At that time, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> would take over with <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> becoming his political
                            adviser.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> did not agree
                            that a troika should be set up in Saigon. He said it would be better for
                            the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officer to take direction rather
                            than participate in a decision-making group.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General, acknowledging that he had not seen all of the
                            reports, said that in his opinion the present situation makes no sense
                            to him on the face of it. The situation in Vietnam is not comparable to
                            that in Iraq or in a South American country where a coup could be
                            brought off promptly. The situation now is no different than that of
                            four months ago when the Generals were not able to organize a coup. To
                            support a coup would be putting the future of Vietnam and in fact all of
                            Southeast Asia in the hands of one man not now known to us. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will not run from a fight or quit
                            under pressure. A failure of a coup risks so much. The reports we have
                            are very thin and the information about the assets which the rebel
                            Generals have at their command is limited. We have a right to know what
                            the rebel Generals are planning. We can't go half way. If the coup
                            fails, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will throw us out.
                            If we send out the draft cable<note n="3" xml:id="d234fn3">For the
                                telegram as sent, see <ref target="#d236">Document 236</ref>. No
                                draft has been found.</note> as it stands, it will appear that we
                            are in favor of a coup and only want more information. “My view is the
                            minority view.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that if we
                            say we are not for a coup, then the coup-minded military leaders will
                            turn against us and the war effort will drop off rapidly.<note n="4" xml:id="d234fn4">In <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName>'s record, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> is paraphrased as follows: “if a major part of
                                the Vietnamese military leadership feels that the war against the
                                Viet Cong could not be won with the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government then it is a major risk for the U.S.
                                in continuing with this government.” According to <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName>'s record, “The Attorney
                                General remarked that he was aware of no support for the view of
                                certain Vietnamese military leaders that the war could not be won
                                with the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government.
                                General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> expressed
                                agreement with the Attorney Generals' point of view.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said he agreed
                            with the Attorney General. When pressed by the President, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said that even a
                            successful coup would slow down the war effort because the new central
                            government would be inexperienced. In addition, all of the province
                            chiefs appointed by <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would
                            probably be replaced by a new government.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said he agreed
                            with General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>. The failure
                            of a coup would be a disaster and a successful coup would have a harmful
                            effect on the war effort.</p>
                        <p>The President asked General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> why all the province chiefs would be replaced. He
                            replied that as <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> appointees
                            they would be loyal to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, and
                            therefore, not trusted by the rebel Generals who had overthrown
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0497"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said the important
                            question was whether the rebel Generals could achieve quick success. He
                            felt that in the long run, if the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government continued, the war effort would go down
                            hill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said it was clear
                            that in Vietnam there was less and less enthusiasm for <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. We cannot predict that the rebel
                            Generals can overthrow the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            government, but <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> cannot
                            carry the country to victory over the Viet Cong. With the passage of
                            time, our objectives in Vietnam will become more and more difficult to
                            achieve with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in
                            control.</p>
                        <p>The President said it appears that the pro- and anti-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> military forces are about equal.
                            If this is so, any attempt to engineer a coup is silly. If <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> agrees with this point of view,
                            then we should instruct him to discourage a coup.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> said the most
                            unfortunate development would be a three-day civil war in Saigon. The
                            time remaining for us to instruct <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> is very short. If a military plane were sent to
                            pick up <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, the Ambassador
                            could stay longer in Vietnam during the uncertain days immediately
                            ahead.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> thought that
                            we ought to leave it up to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> when he would leave Saigon for Washington. In
                            commenting on the draft cable, he said he thought <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> would read it as a change of
                            signals. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> now believes that
                            he is not to thwart a coup. The draft instructs him to call in General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, which would be
                            difficult to do in view of the fact that <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> is not now keeping General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> informed of developments. The
                            Ambassador should be given an option to delay his return if he
                            wishes.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what were <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s existing instructions. In reply, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> read a paragraph from the
                            October 5 telegram.<note n="5" xml:id="d234fn5">Apparent reference to

                        <p>The President agreed to ask <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            what he thought he ought to do about resuming to Washington. Mr.

                        <p>The President commented that he was not so concerned now about the kind
                            of a government which would exist after the coup as he was about the
                            correlation of pro- and anti-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> forces.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed and
                            asked that the draft cable stress our objection to a situation in which
                            there would be major fighting between the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> forces and the rebel Generals.</p>
                        <p>The President said the burden of proof should be on the coup promoters to
                            show that they can overthrow the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government and not create a situation in which
                            there would be a draw. We can discourage a coup in ways other than
                            telling <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> of the rebel
                            Generals' plans. What we say to the coup Generals can be crucial short
                            of revealing their plans to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. The paragraph referring to post-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government matters should be
                            dropped. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> should be told
                            that from here we can see that a disaster could take place and that if
                            the rebels can't win, it would not be sensible for them to go ahead.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> feels that the coup is
                            comparable to a stone rolling down hill which can't be stopped. If this
                            is so, then no one can say that we are to blame for the coup, no matter
                            what we do.</p>
                        <p>In reviewing a request for a country team assessment of the coup
                            situation, the President asked that we make clear to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> the doubts we have concerning
                            the military strength of the rebel Generals and ask him to ask the rebel
                            Generals how they plan to deal with a situation in which their military
                            strength is apparently inferior to that of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime.</p>
                        <p>The President reiterated his suggestion that <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> should tell the Generals that they must prove they
                            can pull off a successful coup or, in our opinion, it would be a mistake
                            to proceed. If we miscalculated, we could lose our entire position in
                            Southeast Asia overnight.</p>

                        <p>The President said that he agreed that <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> should return to Washington by military plane, the
                            time of his departure to be left up to him.</p>

                            whose responsibilities toward any coup are very heavy especially after
                            you leave (see paragraph 7 below). They give much clearer picture
                            group's alleged plans and also indicate chances of action with or
                            without our approval now so significant that we should urgently consider
                            our attitude and contingency plans. We note particularly <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>'s curiosity your departure and his
                            insistence Conein be available from Wednesday<note n="3" xml:id="d236fn3">October 30.</note> night on, which suggests date

                        <p>2. Believe our attitude to coup group can still have decisive effect on
                            its decisions. We believe that what we say to coup group can produce
                            delay of coup and that betrayal of coup plans to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is not our only way of stopping
                            coup. We therefore need urgently your combined assessment with <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> (including their separate comments if they desire). We
                            concerned that our line-up of forces in Saigon (being cabled in next
                                message)<note n="4" xml:id="d236fn4">

                            </note> indicates approximately equal <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0500"/>balance of forces, with substantial possibility serious
                            and prolonged fighting or even defeat. Either of these could be serious
                            or even disastrous for U.S. interests, so that we must have assurance
                            balance of forces clearly favorable.</p>
                        <p>3. With your assessment in hand, we might feel that we should convey
                            message to <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, whether or not he
                            gives 4 or 48 hours notice that would (a) continue explicit hands-off
                            policy, (b) positively encourage coup, or (c) discourage.</p>
                        <p>4. In any case, believe Conein should find earliest opportunity express
                            to <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> that we do not find
                            presently revealed plans give clear prospect of quick results. This
                            conversation should call attention important Saigon units still
                            apparently loyal to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and
                            raise serious issue as to what means coup group has to deal with
                            them.</p>
                        <p>5. From operational standpoint, we also deeply concerned <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> only spokesman for group and
                            possibility cannot be discounted he may not be in good faith. We badly
                            need some corroborative evidence whether <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> and others directly and completely involved. In
                            view <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>'s claim he doesn't
                            handle “military planning” could not Conein tell <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> that we need better military
                            picture and that <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName>
                            could communicate this most naturally and easily to Stilwell? We
                            recognize desirability involving <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            to minimum, but believe Stilwell far more desirable this purpose than
                            using Conein both ways.</p>
                        <p>6. Complexity above actions raises question whether you should adhere to
                            present Thursday schedule. Concur you and other US elements should take
                            no action that could indicate US awareness coup possibility. However,
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> is sending berth-equipped
                            military aircraft that will arrive Saigon Thursday and could take you
                            out thereafter as late as Saturday afternoon in time to meet your
                            presently proposed arrival Washington Sunday. You could explain this
                            being done as convenience and that your Washington arrival is same. A
                            further advantage such aircraft is that it would permit your prompt
                            return from any point en route if necessary. To reduce time in transit,
                            you should use this plane, but we recognize delaying your departure may
                            involve greater risk that you personally would appear involved if any
                            action took place. However, advantages your having extra two days in
                            Saigon may outweigh this and we leave timing of flight to your
                            judgment.</p>
                        <p>7. Whether you leave Thursday or later, believe it essential that prior
                            your departure there be fullest consultation <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> and that there be clear arrangements for handling (a)
                            normal activity, (b) continued coup contacts, (c) action in event a coup
                            starts. We assume you will wish Trueheart as charge to be head of
                            country team in normal situation, but highest authority desires it
                            clearly understood that after your departure <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> should participate in
                            supervision of all coup contacts and that in event coup begins, he
                            become head of country team and direct representative of President, with
                            Trueheart in <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0501"/>effect acting as
                                <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>. On coup contacts we will
                            maintain continuous guidance and will expect equally continuous
                            reporting with prompt account of any important divergencies in
                            assessments of <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 1ine not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>8. If coup should start, question of protecting U.S. nationals at once
                            arises. We can move Marine btl into Saigon by air from Okinawa within 24
                            hours if Tan Son Nhut available. We are sending instructions to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> to arrange orderly movement of
                            seaborne Marine btl to waters adjacent to South Vietnam in position to
                            close Saigon within approximately 24 hours.</p>
                        <p>9. We are now examining post-coup contingencies here and request your
                            immediate recommendations on position to be adopted after coup begins,
                            especially with respect to requests for assistance of different sorts
                            from one side or the other. Also request you forward contingency
                            recommendations for action if coup (a) succeeds, (b) fails, (c) is
                            indecisive.</p>
                        <p>10. We reiterate burden of proof must be on coup group to show a
                            substantial possibility of quick success; otherwise, we should
                            discourage them from proceeding since a miscalculation could result in
                            jeopardizing U.S. position in Southeast Asia.</p>

                        <p>1. On 28 October 1963 Tran Quoc Buu stated to a <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> officer that the <gloss target="#t_CVTC1">CVTC</gloss>
                            and the Vietnamese people as a whole would willingly support a military
                            government brought about by force of arms. They would support an even
                            tougher government than the present regime, as long as it proved itself
                            honest and capable of pursuing a sound policy. The various opposition
                            groups would accept such a government also, particularly since such
                            groups lacked organization and numbers. The <gloss target="#t_CVTC1">CVTC</gloss> would not ask for representation in the government but
                            would carry weight nonetheless, since it was the only independent
                            organization, with the possible exception of the Buddhist groups, which
                            had a large and disciplined membership.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu</persName> added that the key to any
                            change of government at this time is the military. Probably nothing will
                            happen until the military acts; then all elements of the population will
                            immediately rally to the cause, and the present regime would fall in
                            short order.</p>

                        <p>816. Herewith are some ideas for study in the Department and for possible
                            discussion when I am in Washington on the conditions under which the
                            U.S. might resume payment of commercial imports to Vietnam</p>
                        <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0504"/>
                        <p>1. We should decide that we will not again give the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> a blank check and that for the future
                            all aid will be given, for example, on a quarterly basis so that at all
                            times we have some control.</p>
                        <p>2. We should also make it clear that we will not pay back the amount
                            which was lost by the suspension.</p>
                        <p>3. If we decide to resume payments on the strength of an offer by them to
                            do certain things, I would hope that these things would really go to the
                            fundamentals. For example, I attach no value whatever to reshuffling the
                            cabinet. This is one example of a purely superficial measure.</p>
                        <p>4. Some of the steps which would have some meaning would be as
                                follows:<note n="2" xml:id="d239fn2">In telegram 820 from Saigon,
                                October 30, <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> added the
                                additional suggested step: “The most important aim for the
                                government of Vietnam is an effective program for land ownership by
                                the masses of everyday peasants of Vietnam. No other single measure
                                could do more to make the peasant feel that he has a stake in the
                                country and that he will therefore give information and food to the
                                government of Vietnam. This might be that extra political and
                                psychological something which would put the whole war effort over
                                the top.” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss> VIET)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. Putting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> into the
                            Cabinet or into some position with definite limitations where he could
                            be more easily watched and controlled.</p>
                        <p>b. Liberating the prisoners, both Buddhists and students.</p>
                        <p>c. Reopening all the schools.</p>
                        <p>d. Eliminating discriminatory features of Decree Law No. 10.</p>
                        <p>e. Loosening press censorship so as to provide a safety valve for
                            unorthodox opinions.</p>
                        <p>f. Stop arresting people who oppose the government so that there can be
                            some loyal opposition. In general, to be less timid.</p>
                        <p>g. Allow the legislature to function better by having Cabinet Ministers
                            subject to questioning by the legislature.</p>
                        <p>h. Allowing labor to operate in the provinces.</p>
                        <p>i. Let the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mission see whomever and
                            whatever it wants.</p>
                        <p>5. I can think of no way whereby the execution of such a plan could be
                            guaranteed or how we can protect ourselves against foot dragging and
                            evasions.</p>
                        <p>6. We may also face a situation in which they refuse to do anything and
                            yet we consider that we might resume payments. In that case I might call
                            on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, tell him we were going
                            to resume payments on certain items for limited periods and read to him
                            a statement which I would then leave with him and which might say
                            something as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. President, the United States is about to resume payment for certain
                            types of commercial imports for a limited period of time.</p>
                        <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0505"/>
                        <p>“You should know that we suspended these payments in part because of the
                            police state methods used in Vietnam against Buddhist leaders, students
                            and even against Americans. Public opinion was also concerned that the
                            public statements of <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName>
                            and others apparently expressed the point of view of the Government of
                            Vietnam. These things had weakened the support of American public
                            opinion for American help to Vietnam. Under our system of government,
                            even our President cannot go against the full force of public
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>“We now conclude that while much has been done to shake American
                            confidence, there is still faith that the Government of Vietnam, working
                            with the people and the army, and abandoning any exaggerated concern for
                            its own tenure of office, will concentrate wholeheartedly on winning the
                            war against the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>“But candor compels us to say that we must not again be put into the
                            position of condoning brutality and totalitarian practices which go
                            squarely against our traditions and customs.”</p>
                        <p>7. Hope Department will study which of the measures in paragraphs a to i
                            are more or less self-enforcing, that is which the public can watch and
                            see that they are done.</p>

                        <p>I have not been informed by the Ambassador that he has received any such

                            offered no additional information. He has agreed to keep me completely

                            coup will be before November 2nd. He told me he was not planning a coup.

                            Have just received Saigon 768.<note n="12" xml:id="d240fn12">

                            you are correct in believing that the Ambassador is forwarding military
                            reports and evaluations without consulting me. For his weekly report to
                            the President, at his request, I furnish him a short military statement.

                        <p>There is a basic difference apparently between the Ambassador's thinking

                            being additional thoughts did not change the basic guidance in that no
                            initiative should now be taken to give any active covert encouragement
                            to a coup. The Ambassador feels that 74228 does change 63560 and that a
                            change of government is desired and feels as stated in <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Saigon [<hi rend="italic">document

                                <ref target="#d216">Document 216</ref>.</note> that the only way to
                            bring about such a change is by a coup.</p>
                        <p>I'm not opposed to a change in government, no indeed, but I'm inclined to
                            feel that at this time the change should be in methods of governing
                            rather than complete change of personnel. I have seen no batting order
                            proposed by any of the coup groups. I think we should take a hard look
                            at any proposed list before we make any decisions. In my contacts here I
                            have seen no one with the strength of character of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, at least in fighting communists.
                            Certainly there are no Generals qualified to take over in my opinion. I
                            am not a <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> man per se. I
                            certainly see the faults in his character. I am here to back 14 million
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> people in their fight against
                            communism and it just happens that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is their leader at this time. Most of the Generals
                            I have talked to agree they can go along with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, all say it's the <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> family they are opposed to.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the pressures we have begun to apply will cause <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to change their ways. This is apparently not evident
                            as yet. I'm sure the pressures we have begun to apply if continued will
                            affect the war effort. To date they have not. I am watching this closely
                            and will report when I think they have.</p>

                        <p>I do not agree with the Ambassador's assessment in 768 that we are just
                            holding our own. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is a way ahead
                            in the I, II and parts of the III Corps and making progress in the
                            Delta. Nothing has happened in October to change the assessment you and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> made after
                            your visit here.</p>
                        <p>I would suggest we not try to change horses too quickly. That we continue
                            to take persuasive actions that will make the horses change their course
                            and methods of action. That we win the military effort as quickly as
                            possible, then let them make any and all the changes they want.</p>
                        <p>After all, rightly or wrongly, we have backed <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> for eight long hard years. To me
                            it seems incongruous now to get him down, kick him around, and get rid
                            of him. The US has been his mother superior and father confessor since
                            he's been in office and he has leaned on us heavily.</p>
                        <p>Leaders of other under-developed countries will take a dim view of our
                            assistance if they too were led to believe the same fate lies in store

                        <p>I. <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">Reftel</gloss> covers two different classic
                            issues:</p>
                        <p>a. Methods for removing Can Lao influence and opportunities profit from
                            US aid program, and</p>
                        <p>b. Procedural changes in economic aid programs not necessarily related a
                            above.</p>
                        <p>II. Detailed information on first class issues best dealt with by <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> and they will provide separate report.
                            Undoubtedly Can Lao profits from wide range economic concessions not
                            necessarily related <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0509"/>aid
                            programs. Special treatment accorded taxes, monopolies, licenses,
                            government loans, contracts, etc. Eligible importers selected back in
                            1957-1958 with virtually no new members added in interim. According our
                            information, criteria used that time were objective-nevertheless
                            probably Can Lao getting “cut” from those profiting import program
                            expanding list undesirable from standpoint efficiency distribution
                            supplies in country-many believe too many importers now either selling
                            import licenses or unable set up internal distribution channels outside
                            major cities. Furthermore no reason to believe expanding number would
                            necessarily reduce Can Lao capacity project. In summary, we sceptical
                            efficacy suggested remedies or virtually any other remedies so long as
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is in power and holds
                            sway over Can Lao, and he or those he controls are able exact kickbacks
                            from importers virtually at will. If his power broken, issue Can Lao
                            support could become irrelevant.</p>
                        <p>III. With respect to type b issue, our opinion much depends on situation
                            at time we decide resume aid. In present tug of war, two outcomes (with
                            various shadings) possible: (a) favorable change in government or major
                            political concessions by present government; (b) for variety reasons
                            difficult to predict now, we decide resumption aid without any
                            significant improvement our relations. Another dimension to this
                            analysis is an estimate of economic conditions existing at time we
                            resume aid. In any case, it would not be intended permit onset of
                            widespread economic chaos prior to resuming aid.</p>
                        <p>IV. If aid resumed after significant favorable political changes and in
                            the wake of serious price rises and plaster value decline, we certainly
                            would not press for procedural reforms but would rather expedite to
                            maximum input of those aid commodities essential to economy (including
                            refilling pipeline, but not repaying amount lost by suspension).
                            Furthermore, the generally improved nature of our relationships with the
                            government would argue for “detailed consultations and study” rather
                            than imposition of “conditions”.</p>
                        <p>V. If we resume aid in fear of loss <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            or in atmosphere accommodation welfare populace without settlement
                            outstanding issues with government there would be little leverage for
                            exacting procedural concessions. The same is true at present under aid
                                suspension–<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> not likely be
                            receptive to demands for procedural improvements when smarting under US
                            pressure.</p>
                        <p>VI. Given above analysis, we suggest Dept consider, along with
                            suggestions contained <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss>
                                816,<note n="3" xml:id="d241fn3">

                            measures. To extent we retain leverage for reforms, political climate
                            permits, we would then concentrate on such things as:</p>
                        <p>a. Creation of Ministry of Emergency Planning with delegated broad
                            economic powers, under Presidency. This economic czar to have power to
                            impose administrative rulings on all line departments, including
                            National Bank, and to have direct responsibility for only those
                            operations essential to carry out reforms. Areas of concentration would
                            be taxation; exploitation farmers, fishermen and small artisans by
                            middlemen; inefficient government procedure; US foreign aid; joint
                                US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> budgeting; marketing policies
                            for rice, fish, fertilizer, etc.</p>
                        <p>b. Staffing of the top personnel of the Ministry with people of known
                            competence and integrity, e.g. Dean Thuc, Pho Ba Long, Di Kien Thanh,
                            Hanh of SOFIDIV, Vu Van Thai and others.</p>
                        <p>c. Elimination from top posts of incompetent and corrupt officials.</p>
                        <p>d. Joint study and consultation on whole range of economic and financial
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>e. Increase decentralization of responsibility for execution of policies
                            and greater emphasis on local operational initiative in provinces.</p>
                        <p>VII. Hopefully, if some of above things achieved, appropriate procedural
                            reforms suggested <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">reftel</gloss> would flow
                            from them.</p>

                        <p>1. We must, of course, get best possible estimate of chance of coup's
                            success and this estimate must color our thinking, but do not think we
                            have the power to delay or discourage a coup. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> has made it clear many times that
                            this is a Vietnamese affair. It is theoretically possible for us to turn
                            over the information which has been given to us <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0511"/>in confidence to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and this would undoubtedly stop
                            the coup and would make traitors out of us. For practical purposes
                            therefore I would say that we have very little influence on what is
                            essentially a Vietnamese affair. In addition, this would place the heads
                            of the Generals, their civilian supporters and lower military officers
                            on the spot, thereby sacrificing a significant portion of the civilian
                            and military leadership needed to carry the war against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to its successful conclusion. After our
                            efforts not to discourage a coup and this change of heart, we would
                            foreclose any possibility of change of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for the better. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> have
                            displayed no intentions to date of a desire to change the traditional
                            methods of control through police action or take any actions which would
                            undermine the power position or solidarity of the
                                Ngo family. This, despite our heavy pressures
                            directed <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 534.<note n="3" xml:id="d242fn3">
                                <ref target="#d181">Document 181</ref>.</note> If our attempt to
                            thwart this coup were successful, which we doubt, it is our firm
                            estimate that younger officers, small groups of military, would then
                            engage in an abortive action creating chaos ideally suited to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> objectives.</p>
                        <p>2. While we will attempt a combined assessment in a following
                                message,<note n="4" xml:id="d242fn4">Not found.</note> time has not
                            yet permitted substantive examination of this matter with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>. My general view is
                            that the U.S. is trying to bring this medieval country into the 20th
                            century and that we have made considerable progress in military and
                            economic ways but to gain victory we must also bring them into the 20th
                            century politically and that can only be done by either a thoroughgoing
                            change in the behavior of the present government or by another
                            government. The Viet Cong problem is partly military but it is also
                            partly psychological and political.</p>
                        <p>3. With respect to para 3 ref, I believe that we should continue our
                            present position of keeping hands off but continue to monitor and press
                            for more detailed information. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> has
                            been analyzing potential coup forces for some time and it is their
                            estimate that the Generals have probably figured their chances pretty
                            closely and probably also expect that once they begin to move, not only
                            planned units, but other units will join them. We believe that Vietnam's
                            best Generals are involved in directing this effort. If they can't pull
                            it off, it is doubtful other military leadership could do so
                            successfully. It is understandable that the Generals would be reticent
                            to reveal full details of their plan for fear of leaks to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Re para 4 ref, we expect that Conein will meet <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> on the night of 30 Oct or early
                            morning 31 Oct. We agree with para 4 ref that we should continue to
                            press for details and question <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> as to his estimate of the relative strengths of
                            opposing forces. We do not believe, <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0512"/>however, that we should show any signs of attempting to
                            direct this affair ourselves or of giving the impression of second

                            of Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> specifically identified Gen
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> as participating in a
                            plan to change the government. Please note that <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>'s remarks parallel in every way
                            the later statements of Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>.
                            We believe that the limitation of contact to <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> and Conein is an appropriate security measure
                            consonant with our urging that the smallest number of persons be aware
                            of these details.</p>
                        <p>6. We do not believe it wise to ask that “<persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName>” pass his plans to Gen <persName corresp="#p_SMGRG1">Stilwell</persName>. The Vietnamese believe that
                            there are members of the U.S. military who leak to the Government of
                            Vietnam. I do not doubt that this is an unjust suspicion but it is a
                            fact that this suspicion exists and there is no use in pretending that
                            it does not.</p>
                        <p>7. I much appreciate your furnishing the berth equipped military aircraft
                            which I trust is a jet. I intend to tell Pan American that a jet has
                            been diverted for my use and therefore I will no longer need their
                            services. This will undoubtedly leak to the newspapers and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> may study this move with some
                            suspicion. I will answer any inquiries on this score to the effect that
                            I am most pleased by this attention and that this is obviously done as a
                            measure to insure my comfort and save my time. To allay suspicions
                            further, I will offer space on the aircraft to <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> for emergency leave cases, etc, and handle this in as
                            routine a fashion as possible. I wish to reserve comment as to my actual
                            time of departure until I have some additional information, hopefully
                            tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>8. Your para 7 somewhat perplexes me. It does not seem sensible to have
                            the military in charge of a matter which is so profoundly political as a
                            change of government. In fact, I would say to do this would probably be
                            the end of any hope for a change of government here. This is said
                            impersonally as a general proposition, since Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> is a splendid general and an
                            old friend of mine to whom I would gladly entrust anything I have. I
                            assume that the Embassy and <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0513"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> are able to handle normal
                            activities under a, that <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> can
                            continue coup contacts under b, and as regards c, we must simply do the
                            very best we can in the light of events after the coup has started.</p>
                        <p>9. We appreciate the steps taken as outlined in para 8. However, we
                            should remember that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is not
                            totally inept in its foreign soundings and that these moves should be as
                            discreet and security conscious as possible. I would, of course, call
                            for these forces only in case of extreme necessity since my hope
                            coincides with the Generals that this will be an all Vietnamese
                            affair.</p>
                        <p>10. We anticipate that at the outset of the coup, unless it moves with
                            lightning swiftness, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will
                            request me or Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> to use
                            our influence to call it off. I believe our responsibilities should be
                            that our influence certainly could not be superior to that of the
                            President who is Commander in Chief and that if he is unable to call it
                            off, we would certainly be unable to do so and would merely be risking
                            American lives attempting to interfere in this Vietnamese problem. The
                            government might request aircraft. Helicopters, for the evacuation of
                            key personalities, would have to be studied closely, but we would
                            certainly not commit our planes and pilots between the battle lines of
                            the opposing forces. We should, rather, state that we would be willing
                            to act in this fashion during a truce in which both sides agree to the
                            removal of key personalities. I believe that there would be immediate
                            political problems in attempting to take these personalities to another
                            neighboring country and probably we would be best served in depositing
                            them in Saigon [Saipan?] where the absence of press, communications,
                            etc, would allow us some leeway to make a further decision as to their
                            ultimate disposition. If senior Vietnamese personalities and their
                            families requested asylum in the Embassy or other American
                            installations. We would probably have to grant it in light of our
                            previous action with respect to <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                Quang</persName>. This will undoubtedly present later problems but
                            hopefully the new government might feel disposed to help us solve this
                            problem. Naturally asylum would be granted on the same basis as the
                            Buddhists, i.e., physical presence at the Embassy or other location.</p>
                        <p>11. As to requests from the Generals, they may well have need of funds at
                            the last moment with which to buy off potential opposition. To the
                            extent that these funds can be passed discreetly, I believe we should
                            furnish them, provided we are convinced that the proposed coup is
                            sufficiently well organized to have a good chance of success. If they
                            are successful, they will undoubtedly ask for prompt recognition and
                            some assurance that military and economic aid will continue at normal
                            level. We should be prepared to make these statements if the issue is
                            clear-cut predicating our position on the President's stated desire to
                            continue the war against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to final
                            victory. <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> might be an important means
                            of disseminating this message. Should the <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0514"/>coup fail, we will have to pick up the pieces as best
                            we can at that time. We have a commitment to the Generals from the
                            August episode to attempt to help in the evacuation of their dependents.
                            We should try to live up to this if conditions will permit. American
                            complicity will undoubtedly be charged and there might be some acts
                            taken against specific personalities which we should anticipate and make
                            provision against as best we can. Should the coup prove indecisive and a
                            protracted struggle is in progress, we should probably offer our good
                            offices to help resolve the issue in the interest of the war against the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. This might hold some benefit in
                            terms of concessions by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. We will
                            naturally incur some opprobrium from both sides in our role as mediator.
                            However, this opprobrium would probably be less distasteful than a
                            deadlock which would open the door to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. We consider such a deadlock as the least likely
                            possibility of the three.</p>
                        <p>12. As regards your para 10, I do not know what more proof can be offered
                            than the fact these men are obviously prepared to risk their lives and
                            that they want nothing for themselves. If I am any judge of human
                            nature, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>'s face expressed
                            sincerity and determination on the morning that I spoke to him. Heartily
                            agree that a miscalculation could jeopardize position in Southeast Asia.
                            We also run tremendous risks by doing nothing.</p>
                        <p>If we were convinced that the coup was going to fail, we would, of course
                            do everything we could to stop it.</p>
                        <p>13. Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> has read this and
                            does not concur.</p>

                        <p>1. In conversation with <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> officer
                            evening of 29 October 1963 Dr. Dang Van Sung, opposition leader and
                            close friend and political collaborator of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Phan Huy Quat</persName>, said that for past
                            several months he has been working actively to unify various local
                            groups into cohesive <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0515"/>political
                            element. These groups include Sung's front for democratization, elements
                            of the Dai Viet Party, the <gloss target="#t_VNQDD1">VNQDD</gloss> and
                            Duy Dan parties and the Hoa Hao sect. Sung stated that in spite of the
                            historic inability of Vietnamese groups to form a united front, he has
                            made definite progress in bringing these groups together since the
                            present atmosphere is so favorable.</p>
                        <p>2. Sung said that on the basis of this political spadework he has,
                            apparently as representative of the above groups, been in contact with
                            senior military officers through an intermediary. The purpose of these
                            contacts has been to make political recommendation to the senior
                            officers in case there is a change of regime. According to Sung, the
                            military reaction to the general nature of these recommendations has
                            been assuredly favorable although a final decision as to details of the
                            form and structure of a new government has not been made.</p>
                        <p>3. Sung stated that his thinking and that of the military officers
                            comprises both short and long range programs. Immediately after a coup
                            d'etat, assuming that it will be executed by the senior military
                            officers, a transitional government would be formed with a General,
                            probably Duong Van Minh, as President. A civilian, perhaps Tran Van Do,
                            would be named Vice President. Sung said he believed that a military
                            officer would be named Minister of National Defense, but that civilians
                            would head all other ministries which would probably be reduced in
                            number for the sake of efficiency. Sung and his colleagues believe that
                            the plethora of ambitious politicians both in and out of South Vietnam
                            make military control of the transitional government mandatory.</p>
                        <p>4. Sung said that the key feature of the new government would be a
                            quasi-legislative branch known as the group of advisors. This body would
                            have the power to suggest and criticize, but not to overrule decisions
                            of the executive. The advisory group would number twenty-five or thirty
                            members. Ten members would be selected by consultation between the new
                            government and political personalities and other leaders. The first ten
                            members would include, in addition to some of the present opposition
                            leaders, representatives of labor, different religions, etc. The first
                            ten members would then select another fifteen or twenty members vaguely
                            representing various areas of South Vietnam and including the ethnic
                            minorities and religious sects.</p>
                        <p>4. Sung said that after the transitional period of six months to one year
                            a new National Assembly would be chosen by free election and that its
                            membership would be limited to about fifty deputies. Sung said that in
                            his contacts with the senior military officers it has been generally
                            agreed that it would be difficult to retain the present size of the
                            National Assembly and still have energetic and capable Deputies; the
                            emphasis will be on quality rather than assuring that every small region
                            of the country is represented. The transitional group of advisors <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0516"/>will have as a primary
                            objective the preparation for an effective and democratically chosen
                            National Assembly. Sung said it was also agreed that a true and
                            responsible opposition in the National Assembly was the sine qua non of
                            a new government, and that he envisaged his personal role as the
                            formation of such an opposition. Sung added that it was planned that an
                            effective National Assembly and a genuine opposition party would bring
                            about the dissolution of the present opposition parties (Dai Viet,
                                <gloss target="#t_VNQDD1">VNQDD</gloss>, Vuy Dan, etc.) which he
                            termed obsolete and generally wasteless [<hi rend="italic">useless?</hi>].</p>
                        <p>6. Sung said that while the long range goal of a new government would be
                            military victory and economic, social and political reforms leading to
                            democracy, there would be short range measures necessary that perforce
                            would be dictatorial in nature. He mentioned the elimination of the
                            Saigon press (followed by substitution of a responsible press) and the
                            elimination of the present judicial system which he termed a political
                            arm of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. Sung solicited American support
                            and advice in planning and implementing both the short and long range
                            programs of a new government. In the context of American support and
                            advice, Sung stated that he has been working actively among student
                            elements in Saigon from whose ranks future leaders will be drawn.
                            Following the Buddhist dispute, a clandestine inter-high school
                            committee comprising twenty-one members representing about forty public
                            and private high schools was formed. There are seven Communists on this
                            committee. Sung said he has been asked by other students how to
                            counteract the Communist members, but that in the present atmosphere it
                            has been extremely difficult to provide effective advice and
                            support.</p>
                        <p>7. Sung disclaimed any knowledge of the timing of a possible coup d'etat,
                            and was reluctant to discuss measures which might be taken to effect a
                            change of government. He said that he and his colleagues were not
                            participating in the “destructive” aspect of any change, but would bend
                            their energies to getting the country back on the road when there is a
                            change of regime.</p>

                        <p>We are actually in the dark as to the methods the Generals and their
                            civilian allies, if any, plan to use. Going back to Conein's
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> on

                                    177</ref>.</note> he outlined three possible plans:</p>
                        <p>a) assassination of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and Can
                            keeping <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in office—he said
                            this was the easiest plan to accomplish;</p>
                        <p>b) encirclement of Saigon by various military units;</p>
                        <p>c) direct confrontation between coup military units and the loyalist
                            military units in Saigon, dividing city into sectors impeding [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] it out pocket by pocket.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> also said in the same
                            conversation that he would have to get rid of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, Can and <persName corresp="#p_HIEU1">Hieu</persName>, that would bring Colonel
                                <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> on his knees before
                            him.</p>
                        <p>There have been further somewhat more indirect references to
                            assassinations and elimination of the entire Ngo family.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Coup Planning</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> earlier promised Conein that
                            the coup committee had agreed that the complete political and military
                            planning would be turned over for study by Ambassador two days prior to
                            scheduled time for coup (conversation night of 24 October<note n="3" xml:id="d244fn3">See <ref target="#d215">Document
                            215</ref>.</note>), but in a conversation with Conein on 28
                                October,<note n="4" xml:id="d244fn4">See <ref target="#d225">Document 225</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said that possibly plans
                            could only be made available four hours in advance. He questioned Conein
                            closely as to time on 31 October Ambassador would [be] leaving.</p>
                        <p>As to who is doing the planning, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> indicated to Conein that he was contact man with the
                            Americans, other Generals and division commanders. <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> was doing the political planning
                            and military planning is in the hands of others (presumably <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> himself).</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Leading Coup Personalities</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Military:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As early as October 5, <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName>
                            informed Conein that “among other Generals participating with him in
                            this plan were: Major General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, Brigadier General <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>, and Major General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>.”</p>
                        <p>In their October 24 conversation, Conein told <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> that the coup committee included himself, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, General Chieu, and
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>. (<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> General <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>
                            is here left out and replaced by General Chieu whom we know to have been
                            long in dissidence. In their October 28 conversation, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> told Conein that General <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> was being very circumspect as
                            he knew he was under suspicion by the President.)</p>
                        <p>Again on October 28 <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> told
                            Conein that General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> was
                            cooperating, but not a member of the coup committee; he would “not
                            attempt to take his corps area into dissidence.” <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> also said the same applied to
                            Generals <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In their October 28 conversation, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> told Conein that he would be leaving on the morning
                            of October 29 to see Generals <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> to perfect the
                            planning. He cautioned against trusting Lt. Col. Thao whom he said was
                            suspect by the Generals' group.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Civilian:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is clear that certain civilian and oppositionist elements have
                            knowledge of the Generals' coup planning though perhaps not in
                            significant detail. These civilians are predominantly the leaders of the
                            old anti-French, anti-Communist, anti-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Nationalist <hi rend="italic">Dai Viet</hi>
                            group.</p>
                        <p>Notably they include <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bui Diem</persName>, the
                            more dynamic of younger Dai Viet leaders; Dang Van Sung and Pham Huy
                            Quat, old-time leaders of the Dai Viet; and Tran Trung Dung, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s Defense Secretary from 1955 to
                            November 1960.</p>
                        <p>In a conversation between Dung and a <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>

                            regime headed by Vice President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>, with Quat as Prime Minister. He singled out the
                            following for cabinet posts; Tran Van Ly (former Governor of Central
                            Vietnam); Phan Quang Dan (long-time oppositionist who spent many years
                            in US); Tran Van Tuyen (a former Cao Dai political adviser); and Pham
                            Khac Suu, another well known <hi rend="italic">Dai Viet</hi>
                            oppositionist in Saigon. He also mentioned three exiles as worthy of
                            consideration, including Nguyen Huu Chau and Nguyen Ton Hoan.</p>

                            October 24, in which <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> stated
                            that: a) the succeeding government would be civilian; b) it would as
                            soon as possible free non-Communist political prisoners and hold honest
                            elections, and would tolerate the operation of opposition parties; c)
                            there would be complete freedom of religion; and d) it would be
                            pro-Western, but not a vassal of the US, to “carry the war against
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to successful conclusion with

                        <p>Question 1: Are we gaining or losing on balance and day by day in the
                            contest with the Viet Cong?</p>
                        <p>Answer: No major change in military situation during last week. Most
                            noteworthy event which happened to me personally is highly secret
                            statement by Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, Acting
                            Chief, Joint General Staff, that he did not think the war could be won
                            [with] the present government in power before the Americans left and
                            certainly could not be won after that. I continue to think that we can
                            and must continue the present utterly essential holding operation, but
                            that it will take something more than is now being done by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> politically and psychologically to get
                            a real victory.</p>
                        <p>Question 2: Is the government responding at any point to our threefold
                            need for improvement in (a) campaign against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, (b) internal political developments and (c) actions
                            affecting relations with American people and government?</p>
                        <p>Answer: On (a) no major change. No specific responses have been received
                            from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concerning the military areas
                            which we have cited as needing improvement.</p>

                        <p>Question 3: What does the evidence suggest on the strengthening or
                            weakening of effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in
                            relation to its own people?</p>
                        <p>Answer: A report from the Acting Consul in Hue cites the case of a
                            Vietnamese lady, headmistress of a girls school in Hue, who was still in
                            prison because she had been guilty of writing a letter to the President
                            “almost asking for changes in government” and of having it signed by
                            members of the school faculty. The letter urged the President to exert
                            his leadership to solve the Buddhist problem and to reject the
                            oppressive actions of the lower officials. The American Consul, who took
                            the matter up with the government, was told that as soon as she finished
                            “confessing” the problem would be brought before a military court. Over
                            the last weekend the lady was released, but it is believed that this was
                            done in connection with the visit of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegation and there is speculation as to what will
                            happen to her after the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegation
                            leaves. There is no reason to think that this case is extraordinary.</p>
                        <p>There is also a report of Army officers being asked to make lists of
                            those in their units whose actions are opposed to course taken by
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Question 4: And more specifically, what effect are we getting from our
                            own actions under Deptel 534<note n="3" xml:id="d245fn3">
                                <ref target="#d181">Document 181</ref>.</note> and what
                            modifications in either direction do you think advisable?</p>
                        <p>Answer: We are beginning to get some effect from our pressure under 534
                            but little concrete action. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            invited me to spend Sunday with him and raised the whole subject of
                            suspension of commodity imports which, I hope, is the start of a
                            dialogue. Thuan later hinted that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s overture might be the beginning. Suspension of
                            commodity imports and the cessation of aid to <persName corresp="#p_LQTC1">Colonel Tung</persName> appear to have impressed
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> with our annoyance as no amount
                            of rhetoric could have done. Perhaps they will propose some steps be
                            taken by them in exchange for our resuming our aid, although I doubt
                            that they will offer anything significant. Whatever they promise to do
                            would be subject to delay and would be difficult to verify.</p>
                        <p>When we decide the time is ripe for us to resume aid then perhaps I
                            should be authorized to make a statement to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> explaining that the policies of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had made it very difficult for us to
                            continue aid, but that, although American confidence had been weakened,
                            we nonetheless had concluded that they intended to win the war; that <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0521"/>they would be less worried in
                            the future about their own tenure of office, and that, on strength of
                            these assumptions we would resume payments on specific categories
                            released at periodic intervals.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other reactions were as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Dr. Herbert K. Walther of the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>
                            education division, who probably sees more Vietnamese students and
                            professors than any other official in the Mission, reports that not once
                            had a professor or a student expressed anything but praise for the U.S.
                            decision to withhold aid to Vietnam. All of his contacts with remarkable
                            unanimity said they welcomed the recent U.S. moves and their only
                            criticism was that it should have been done sooner.</p>
                        <p>b. General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> expressed pleasure
                            that <persName corresp="#p_LQTC1">Colonel Tung</persName>'s force had
                            been placed under the Joint General Staff. He was also concerned with
                            devaluation of plaster.</p>
                        <p>c. Vice President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> asked a
                            visitor whether I was strong enough to stand firm in current situation.

                        <p>d. In the market place prices of imported goods continued upward with
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reportedly controlling flour and
                            condensed milk, as wholesale quantities unavailable. Currency market
                            continues gyrations. Gold which rose 50 percent dropped 12 percent

                        <p>Rumors of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> actions persist, but
                            nothing happens. Reports on licensing not received from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> since October 17, so unable to
                            determine whether any additional items formerly U.S. financed have been
                            picked up by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Overall picture
                            remains one of confusion among businessmen and civil servants. Some
                            expressions discontent now being heard from trade unions. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials also personally concerned at
                            price movement, combined with rumored threat of salary cut and increased
                            cost of living resulting from having buy noon meal when new working
                            hours go into effect.</p>
                        <p>I understand there is enough milk to last until December or January. I
                            intend to make this available whenever necessary to assure normal amount
                            for popular consumption.</p>

                            explanation why I had not seen 768 until one week after dispatch and
                            only then when I requested a copy so that I might intelligently respond
                            to your <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> 4188-63 which referred to
                            768.</p>
                        <p>4. Upon receipt of Deptel 576 Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> requested that I provide him brief suggested
                            inputs for responses to questions 1 and 2 (a) 1 of Deptel 576 in that
                            they were principally military in nature. I have done this on weekly
                            basis but have had no knowledge as to whether my suggested brief inputs
                            were utilized in his personal report since as indicated above these were
                            not opened to me.</p>
                        <p>5. My suggested brief inputs for para 1 which were provided the
                            Ambassador for use as he saw fit in drafting his personal evaluations
                            for the past three weeks follow:</p>
                        <p>16 Oct: On balance we are gaining in the contest with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. There will continue to be minor ups and
                            downs but the general trend has been and continues upward.</p>
                        <p>23 Oct: While significant changes are, and will be, difficult to identify
                            on a day to day or even weekly comparative basis as regards the contest
                            with the Viet Cong, the general trend continues to be favorable. The
                            tempo of <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>-initiated operations is
                            increasing and recently the tempo of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>-initiated activity has fallen off.</p>
                        <p>30 Oct: No change from that previously reported. National day affairs
                            this past week tended to bring about a slight reduction in the tempo of
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>-initiated actions, however
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> initiated actions also waned and
                            on balance the trend continues to be favorable.</p>

                        <p>6. My suggested brief inputs for paragraph 2(a) which were provided the
                            Ambassador for use as he saw fit in drafting his personal evaluations
                            for the past three weeks follow:</p>
                        <p>16 Oct: The government has responded at many points when we have cited
                            need for improvement in the campaign against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> (shift of boundaries; placement of <gloss target="#t_VNSF1">VNSF</gloss> activities in corps areas under
                                <gloss target="#t_OPCON1">OPCON</gloss> of corps comdr; reallocation
                            of forces). Additionally Gen Don and Gen Stilwell, my G-3 have spent the
                            last week in the conduct of a Corps by Corps assessment of the present
                            situation with a view to further desirable reallocation of forces. Based
                            on their recommendations I will make further recommendations to Pres.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. (for inclusion in ans
                            to para 2(a) Ambassador was advised that US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military relations remain good).</p>
                        <p>23 Oct: Response received from the government in reaction to military
                            areas where we have cited needed improvement has been favorable in some
                            areas, while in other areas no indication of response has been received
                            to date. In no case have they flatly resisted recommended improvements.
                            Favorable indications are the commitment of nearly half of the general
                            reserve to operations, plans for possible further redistribution of
                            forces, and a recognition of the requirement to effect consolidation in
                            the strategic hamlet program.</p>
                        <p>30 Oct: No specific responses have been received from the government this
                            past week in reaction to military areas where we have cited need for
                            improvement. This is believed due in areas part to their preoccupation
                            with National day affairs.</p>
                        <p>7. Comparison of 23 October suggested brief inputs quoted above with
                            Saigon 768 indicates Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> did not see fit to utilize my suggestions to any
                            significant degree. It also apparent that upon further reflection
                            Ambassador determined that more detailed response was required than he
                            initially felt necessary when he requested brief inputs on principally
                            military items.</p>
                        <p>8. I believe certain portions Saigon 768 require specific comment. These
                            follow:</p>
                        <p>Para F of answer to question 1—View of Vice Pres <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> that there are only 15 to 20
                            all-around hamlets in the area south of Saigon which are really good is
                            ridiculous and indicates need for him to get out of Saigon and visit
                            countryside so as to really know of progress which is being made.</p>
                        <p>In past two weeks I have visited nine Delta provinces (Tay Ninh, Binh
                            Duong, Hau Nhgia, Long An, Kien Phong, Kien Hoa, An Giang, Phong Dinh,
                            Chaong Thien) eight of which are south of Saigon, and I do not find the
                            province chiefs or sector advisors to hold the same views as Vice Pres
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Para H of answer to question 1—I am unable to concur in statement that
                            “one cannot drive as much around the country as one could two years
                            ago”. I believe it will be some time before, if we ever do, experience
                            mass surrenders of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. I am unable to
                            concur in statement <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0524"/>that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is “in fact, reckoned at a higher figure
                            than it was two years ago”. I have not observed the signs that hatred of
                            the government has tended to diminish the Army's vigor, enthusiasm and
                            enterprise. I find it difficult to believe the few rumors one hears
                            regarding Generals being paid off with money and flashy cars. Most cars
                            I see in use by Generals are same they have been using for past two
                            years and few if any qualify as flashy to my mind. I do not concur with
                            the evaluation of the 14 October report of the Delta subcommittee of the
                            Committee on Province Rehabilitation<note n="6" xml:id="d246fn6">The
                                report of this subcommittee of the Saigon Country Team's Committee
                                on Province Rehabilitation has not been found.</note> which states
                            that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are gaining. Moreover I take
                            exception to the implication that the report represents official country
                            team agency views and is consequently authoritative in the views it
                            presents. Agency representatives on this sub-committee served as
                            individuals in reporting to the <gloss target="#t_COPROR1">COPROR</gloss> Committee, incidentally there were wide divergencies
                            even among sub-committee members.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_COPROR1">COPROR</gloss> Committee received but did not
                            place its stamp of approval or concurrence on report to its
                            Sub-Committee. <gloss target="#t_COPROR1">COPROR</gloss> Committee
                            returned the report to its Sub-Committee for rework. Consequently this
                            report has not as yet been submitted to country team nor has it been
                            referred to individual country team agencies for review and/or comment.
                            Any views quoted from this Sub-Committee report therefore have no
                            validity as expressions of country team or individual agency views.</p>
                        <p>Para J of answer to question 1—With regard to the “existing political
                            control over troop movements, which prevents optimum use of the Army”, I
                            do not deny that political influences enter into this picture; however,
                            I feel we have made and are making significant strides in this area and
                            do not concur that time is not working for usso long as political
                            controls remain as at present.</p>
                        <p>Para J of answer to question 1—As indicated in paras 5 and 6 above and in
                            other reports I have filed my evaluation is that from the military point
                            of view the trend is definitely in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>
                            favor consequently I cannot concur that “we at present are not doing
                            much more than holding our own”.</p>
                        <p>Answer under (a) to question 2—I am correctly quoted here but para 6
                            above gives full context of my suggested input.</p>
                        <p>Answer under (c) to question 2—As indicated para 6 above Ambassador was

                        <p>MAC 2034. When I said last week I was out of the coup business I did not
                            realize I was going to be out of touch. In fact the Ambassador agreed to
                            keep me informed. So I was a bit shocked when the Ambassador called me
                            today on instructions from Washington to collaborate on reply on message
                            (I don't have the number) seeking further info from here. I was shocked
                            because I had not seen any of the Saigon 20 series [document number not
                                declassified],<note n="2" xml:id="d247fn2">

                        <p>I did not know there had been further contacts between <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> and Conein. I really did not
                            realize how imminent <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>'s plan
                            is to implementation.</p>
                        <p>As we do not know the plan I can not say how good it is. To me it just
                            looked like <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> has run down the
                            Army roster indicating troops to be used.</p>
                        <p>How the 21st, 9th, 7th, 23rd, and 5th Divisions can lend any immediate
                            support to an effort in Saigon is hard to visualize. If they are brought
                            into the area the V.C. will certainly take advantage and I can not guess
                            how long it would take to reestablish G.V.N. in the abandoned areas. If
                            he plans to use only the loyal local troops the effort may well be a
                            flop.</p>
                        <p>I read the Ambassador's reply<note n="4" xml:id="d247fn4">

                            that course. We recognize the danger of appearing hostile to Generals,
                            but we believe that our own position should be on as firm ground as
                            possible, hence we cannot limit ourselves to proposition implied in your
                            message that only conviction of certain failure justifies intervention.
                            We believe that your standard for intervention should be that stated
                            above.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore, if you should conclude that there is not clearly a high
                            prospect of success, you should communicate this doubt to Generals in a
                            way calculated to persuade them to desist at least until chances are
                            better. In such a communication you should use the weight of U.S. best
                            advice and explicitly reject any implication that we oppose the effort
                            of the Generals because of preference for present regime. We recognize
                            need to bear in mind Generals' interpretation of U.S. role in 1960 coup
                            attempt, and your agent should maintain clear distinction between strong
                            and honest advice given as a friend and any opposition to their
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>4. We continue to be deeply interested in up-to-the-minute assessment of
                            prospects and are sending this before reply to our [<hi rend="italic">document number not declassified</hi>].<note n="4" xml:id="d249fn4">

                        <p>5. To clarify our intent, paragraph 7 of our [<hi rend="italic">document
                                number not declassified</hi>]<note n="5" xml:id="d249fn5">
                                <ref target="#d236">Document 236</ref>.</note> is rescinded and we
                            restate our desires as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. While you are in Saigon you will be chief of country team in all
                            circumstances and our only instruction is that we are sure it will help
                            to have Harkins fully informed at all stages and to use advice from both
                            him and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] in
                            framing guidance for coup contacts and assessment. We continue to be
                            concerned that neither Conein nor any other reporting source is getting
                            the clarity we would like with respect to alignment of forces and level
                            of determination among Generals.</p>
                        <p>b. When you leave Saigon and before there is a coup, Trueheart will be
                            chief of the country team. Our only modification of existing procedures
                            is that in this circumstance we wish all instructions to Conein to be
                            conducted in immediate consultation with Harkins and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] so that all three know what
                            is said to Conein. Any disagreement among the three on such instructions
                            should be reported to Washington and held for our resolution, when time
                            permits.</p>
                        <p>c. If you have left and a coup occurs, we believe that emergency
                            situation requires, pending your return, that direction of country team
                            be vested in most senior officer with experience of military decisions,
                            and that officer in our view is Harkins. We do not intend that this
                            switch in final responsibility should be publicized in any way, and <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0528"/>Harkins will of course be
                            guided in basic posture by our instructions, which follow in paragraph
                            7. Thus we do not believe that this switch will have the effect
                            suggested in your paragraph 8.</p>
                        <p>6. This paragraph contains our present standing instructions for U.S.
                            posture in the event of a coup.</p>
                        <p>a. U.S. authorities will reject appeals for direct intervention from
                            either side, and U.S.-controlled aircraft and other resources will not
                            be committed between the battle lines or in support of either side,
                            without authorization from Washington.</p>
                        <p>b. In event of indecisive contest, U.S. authorities may in their
                            discretion agree to perform any acts agreeable to both sides, such as
                            removal of key personalities or relay of information. In such actions,
                            however, U.S. authorities will strenuously avoid appearance of pressure
                            on either side. It is not in the interest of USG to be or appear to be
                            either instrument of existing government or instrument of coup.</p>
                        <p>c. In the event of imminent or actual failure of coup, U.S. authorities
                            may afford asylum in their discretion [to] those to whom there is any
                            express or implied obligation of this sort. We believe however that in
                            such a case it would be in our interest and probably in interest of
                            those seeking asylum that they seek protection of other Embassies in
                            addition to our own. This point should be made strongly if need
                            arises.</p>
                        <p>d. But once a coup under responsible leadership has begun, and within
                            these restrictions, it is in the interest of the U.S. Government that it
                            should succeed.</p>
                        <p>7. We have your message<note n="6" xml:id="d249fn6">Apparent reference to

                        <p>1. A provisional analysis of past coup reporting indicates that various
                            dissident officers have been slowly getting together, establishing
                            contacts with other groups, and by evolutionary process this now appears
                            to be congealing primarily behind the Generals.</p>
                        <p>2. Among the dissident elements of which we are aware are the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>a. The <persName corresp="#p_TKT1">Tran Kim Tuyen</persName> group, which
                            in itself was an amalgam of military, civilian nationalist, Buddhist and
                            student groups. Organization was extensive and well compartmented.</p>
                        <p>b. The Lt Col Pham Ngoc Thao/Huynh Van Lang group which developed
                            military support, established liaison with and now reportedly has
                            partially merged with and trying to take the leadership of the <persName corresp="#p_TUYEN1">Tuyen</persName> group.</p>
                        <p>c. A group of Central Vietnamese military officers who appear to be a
                            part of the the Generals coup, headed by Gen <persName corresp="#p_LVNBG1">Le Van Nghiem</persName>, with Generals Pham
                            Xuan Chieu, <persName corresp="#p_LVKBG1">Le Van Kim</persName>, Tran
                            Van Minh, <persName corresp="#p_NNTV1">Nguyen Ngoc Le</persName>, and
                            Duong Van Hinh as part of the upper structure. It was supposedly
                            paralleled by group of Northern and Southem officers under Gens Chieu
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> respectively. While
                            little is known of the overall direction, some unit support was
                            identified.</p>
                        <p>d. The United Front Party, described by Bui Thngt [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Long Hy, which is organized into three-man cells of
                            intellectuals and professionals, with the aim of overthrowing the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime. This may be one
                            of the segments of the <persName corresp="#p_TUYEN1">Tuyen</persName>
                            group.</p>
                        <p>e. The Dai Viet element, represented by <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bui
                                Diem</persName>, working with the Generals. Conversation with Dang
                            Van Sung and Tran Trung Dung indicate they are very knowledgeable and,
                            we suspect, participant.</p>
                        <p>f. The Vietnam Quoc Dan Dang element of Nguyen Van Luc who very early
                            established contact with and promised support for the <persName corresp="#p_TUYEN1">Tuyen</persName> group, and the Thao/Lang group
                            have been trying to exploit them.</p>
                        <p>g. We have had several reports indicating Colonels, and junior officers,
                            particularly from Airborne, Marines, and Armor, were discussing a coup
                            among themselves.</p>
                        <p>h. The group of Major Nguyen Van Bich, reportedly DCO of 23rd Division,
                            who came to our attention through Du Phnoc Long of the Press Liaison
                            Bureau, which wished to develop a redoubt area near the <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0530"/>Cambodian border. Long's involvement
                            may indicate that this was an element of <persName corresp="#p_TUYEN1">Tuyen</persName>'s group which may have lost contact with other
                            elements with <persName corresp="#p_TUYEN1">Tuyen</persName>'s
                            departure. Other comments of Long indicate it may also have been an
                            element of the Vietnam Quoc Dan Dang. Long stated later that events had
                            left these plans behind.</p>
                        <p>i. The group of Nguyen Huu Duong, a govt attorney, has many contacts in
                            both the civilian and military sides. This group worked parallel with
                            the Tudo group, both having many contacts with students. Duong's group
                            and the Tudo group were interdependent and were associated with the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TUYEN1">Tuyen</persName> group.</p>
                        <p>j. The Generals' group, headed by Duong Van Minh with <persName corresp="#p_TVDMG1">Tran Van Don</persName> as spokesman and
                                <persName corresp="#p_LVKBG1">Le Van Kim</persName> as political
                            organizer. Most of the above groups now appear to be involved with this
                            group. Elements of a, c, e, f, and g, have been identified with the
                            Generals. In addition there is considerable duplication of units claimed
                            by the Generals and the Thao/Lang group.</p>
                        <p>k. Pham Huy Co's Territorial Action Committee, clearly planning overthrow
                            of regime, has been active in psywar, has some civilian organization; no
                            real indication of broad military support, but there is no indication
                            yet that it constitutes a unified coup mechanism.</p>
                        <p>3. We feel that most coup activity now centers around the Thao/ Lang
                            group on the one hand and the Generals' group on the other, and the
                            question may well be who will lead the units anxious to participate.
                            Both groups seek to use many of the same units with the Generals' group
                            appearing to be better and more broadly organized. If the Thao/Lang
                            group move first, they must hope for defections from the evident
                            opposition, support from units whose loyalty they are not sure of, or a
                            swift action which quickly eliminates the Ngo family. Even if
                            successful, it is not at all certain they can implement their political
                            program. We believe that if the Generals move first, the power will be
                            with them and the Thao/Lang group would be forced to lend the support of
                            what little is distinctively their own. The Generals reportedly do not
                            plan to bring in Thao from the start as they distrust him, but are
                            willing to use him.</p>

                                1984, respectively, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                                attempted a last ditch ploy to save his brother's government. As the
                                American of ficals remember it, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was generally aware of coup plotting at the end
                                of October, “that the elephants were crashing about in the jungle
                                and some were getting pretty close to him.” <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> concluded that the only way to
                                turn the situation around was to show the United States that he and
                                his brother were the “only saviors of Vietnam.” <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> arranged with General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>, military commander of the
                                Saigon military district, to stage a fake Viet Cong uprising in
                                Saigon. Included in the plan was the assassination of key U.S.
                                officials. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> then planned
                                to send “loyal” troops from <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>'s contingent to put down the revolt, restore
                                order, and save Vietnam. But <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> had been won over to the coup plotters' side
                                and he told his rebel colleagues of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s plans. As Conein described it, the Generals'
                                “double bumped” <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. When the

                        <p>2129. Ref: <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Washington [<hi rend="italic">document number not declassified</hi>].<note n="2" xml:id="d254fn2">
                                <ref target="#d237">Document 237</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Following comments keyed to units named in ref:</p>
                        <p>2. President Guard: Concur. Guard has estimated strength of 18 M-24
                            tanks, four M-114 and four M-113 armored personnel carriers. Guard lacks
                            combat experience of such units as Airborne and Marines.</p>
                        <p>3. Airborne brigade: Commanders of 3rd, 5th, 7th and 8th Btns all
                            reportedly close to Major Ho Tieu, Airborne DCO and <gloss target="#t_CO1">CO</gloss>s, whom we believe most likely prospect to
                            organize airborne support for coup. However, <gloss target="#t_CO1">CO</gloss> of 3rd is weak and not likely to participate. The 1st
                            Btn is reported as part of coup force organized by <persName corresp="#p_TKT1">Tran Kim Tuyen</persName>. The 1st and 7th Btn
                                <gloss target="#t_CO1">CO</gloss>'s have been critical of regime to
                            their advisors. Contrary to report of <persName corresp="#p_TUYEN1">Tuyen</persName>'s coup group, we consider 6th Btn <gloss target="#t_CO1">CO</gloss> most <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0534"/>loyal to the regime. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> has report he may be relieved shortly for incompetence.
                            In Airborne, as in Marine Brigade, Btns constantly being shifted for
                            tactical reasons. On 31st October 1st Btn in new Hau Nghia Province; 3rd
                            Btn on alert at Tan Son Nhut; 5th and 7th Btns in Binh Duong Province;
                            8th Btn in Kien Hoa Province; and 6th Btn going into training at Vung
                            Tau.</p>
                        <p>4. Marine Brigade: 2nd and 3rd Btns in Saigon area; First and Fourth Btns
                            on operation in Binh Duong Province. Brigade <gloss target="#t_CO1">CO</gloss> Le Nguyen Khang reportedly disaffected since beginning
                            Buddhist crisis and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> information
                            indicates Khang waiting on coup but willing to sit it out. Capt Ma Viet
                            Bang, <gloss target="#t_CO1">CO</gloss> 3rd Btn, reported disaffected
                            and coup-minded, along with Tran Van Nhut, <gloss target="#t_CO1">CO</gloss> 1st Btn.</p>
                        <p>5. Armor: In addition to Presidential Guard Armor, other Armor units in
                            Saigon include the 2nd Plt, 1st Co, 2nd Squadron (five M-24 tanks) at
                            Tan Son Nhut; 3rd Plt, 1st Co, 2nd Sqrd (five M-24 tanks) at <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss>; two M-113's, two M-24's; and six M-8's
                            at 1st Sqdr <gloss target="#t_HQS1">HQS</gloss>, Go yap; the 5th Mech
                            Rifle Co, 1st Sqdr, in Saigon area; two pits of 1st Tank Co, 1st Sqdr
                            (about 10 tanks) in Saigon area; one pit, 1st Tank Co, 1st Sqdr (about
                            five tanks) at Bien Hoar and 4th Co, 4th Sqdr (15 M-113) at Go yap.
                                <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> reports indicate that Fifth Co,
                            1st Armor Sqdr, most likely to join a coup having promised support to
                            Tuyen coup group, working with Major Nguyen Van Tu, <gloss target="#t_CO1">CO</gloss>, 8th Rgt, Binh Duong Prov. First Tank Co,
                            1st Sqdr, has figured in coup reporting without indicating if company
                                <gloss target="#t_CO1">CO</gloss> involved. An armor company from
                            2nd Armor Sqdr has been reported as involved in coup. This unit was
                            reportedly brought to Saigon area at the arrangement of Gen <persName corresp="#p_TTKG1">Tran Thien Khiem</persName>, ostensibly for
                            counter-coup activity. Two <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> sources
                            report that Armor School Commander promises between 40 and 50 vehicles
                            including tanks and armored personnel carriers. The school is located at
                            Long Hai and has total of 35 armored vehicles of which four are
                            currently dead-lined and eight are in poor condition. If additional
                            truck transport available to the school were included, the number of
                            vehicles could fall into the reported range. One senior Armor staff
                            officers has stated he will lead elements of 1st Sqdr Armor and a
                            portion of the Presidential Guard Armor in a coup.</p>
                        <p>6. Special Forces: Some Special Forces officers have indicated feeling of
                            dissidence with the regime, but we concur that they must be carried as a
                            loyal element in terms of organized force. Four companies of Special
                            Forces are not in the Saigon area at present.</p>
                        <p>7. We concur that the uniformed police constitute a negligible factor.
                            The Combat Police, while trained in riot control have not been called
                            upon to stand up under fire. The coup forces claim they can split the
                            Combat Police.</p>
                        <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0535"/>
                        <p>8. Fifth Division: The regimental commanders have long been claimed
                            dissident by coup organizers including <persName corresp="#p_TUYEN1">Tuyen</persName>, and the division <gloss target="#t_CO1">CO</gloss>, Col <persName corresp="#p_NVTC1">Nguyen Van
                                Thieu</persName>, has recently been reported by <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> sources as joining the coup. He has
                            been frequently reported as friendly with some of the participant
                            Generals. The Seventh Regiment is the least committed in fighting at
                            present. The <gloss target="#t_CO1">CO</gloss> 8th Regiment (Maj Tu) has
                            been named by a number of <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> sources as
                            participant in coup plotting, and he is supported by his btn commanders.
                            Although the current situation is unknown, 8th Rgt was to provide one to
                            two btns to come to the relief of the regime in the event of a coup, but
                            these btns planned to switch sides upon arrival at Saigon. Lack of
                            transport may make it difficult for more than one btn of any rat to be
                            moved at a time.</p>
                        <p>9. Seventh Division: Col Dam is reported dissident but we regard him as
                            weak and not likely to commit himself. His deputy, Lt Col Nguyen Van Tu,
                            appears to be the stronger personality and has been reported as a part
                            of coup plotting by several sources. <persName corresp="#p_TUYEN1">Tuyen</persName> claimed Tu was to lead counter-coup forces from
                            the division to Saigon following the eruption of his coup, and join the
                            coup. Seventh has only three mobile battalions.</p>
                        <p>10. Air Force: Dissidence is very widespread and in spite of Col Hien's
                            loyalty, we believe the coup group can gain control by eliminating Hien
                            and having Lt Col <persName corresp="#p_NCKLC1">Nguyen Cao
                            Ky</persName>, backed by Lt Col Do Khac Mai, assume control. We are
                            reluctant to relegate the Air Force as a strictly secondary force. They
                            could prove a decisive factor if turned loose against Gia Long Palace,
                            and would also be of assistance as an interdiction force against loyal
                            elements moving on Saigon.</p>
                        <p>11. Miscellaneous units: We agree that these are generally insignificant
                            with a few exceptions. The 3rd Bt, 46th Rgt, as [has?] the defense of
                            Bien Hoa Air Base where the nearest fighter squadron is located and one
                            report claims it is involved in the coup. In addition, counter-coup
                            forces are reportedly to be brought in from Quang Trung and Thu Duc
                            Training Centers. <persName corresp="#p_TUYEN1">Tuyen</persName> claimed
                            he had subverted these forces as well.</p>
                        <p>12. The units in the field can be expected to have sufficient ammunition
                            for the coup. Although <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> gasoline
                            allotments recently decreased, reserves are adequate for any
                            coup-related troop movements. Transportation also can be assumed
                            available for field units.</p>
                        <p>13. It should be pointed out that we have not been given the coup plans
                            nor a rundown on coup forces. General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> states he has nothing to do with the military
                            preparations in the organization of a compartmented coup program. What
                            information <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> gave Conein was
                            in response to specific attempts at elicitation by Conein and <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>'s replies were vague, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> claiming he was passing on only
                            some of the details he had overheard. Thus, we are unable to adequately
                            assess the viability <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0536"/>of the
                            coup group. The basic questions are whether the Generals have the
                            courage and competence to mount a coup successfully. They are basically
                            cautious and it appears unlikely they would move without expecting
                            success.</p>

                            foregone without creating a serious security problem for the

                            very hopeful for early recognition of their new govt by the United

                            to join the new govt. They will not attempt to force Thich Tri Quang in

                            Embassy interpreter and I met with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> from 10:00 am until 11:15 today. Afterwards I spoke
                            alone with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> for 20 minutes
                            (see separate telegram).<note n="2" xml:id="d261fn2">

                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> added following with
                            unusual directness:</p>
                        <p>a. Junior <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officers were poisoning
                            atmosphere by spreading rumors of coups against him. Said one such
                            officer, Hodges has recently told General Staff that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> planning demonstration against American
                            Embassy. Hodges had remarked that if this happened, Seventh Fleet would
                            fend, etc. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> remarked Hodges
                            clearly knew more about this than he did but added that enemy would take
                            advantage such rumors. Said two Viet Cong killed south of Saigon October
                            23 had on person <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> plans for taking
                            advantage of any coup attempt to seize Saigon.</p>
                        <p>b. USG plan to withhold aid would hurt war effort, would work special
                            hardship on soldiers and unpaid Strategic Hamlet guards (Combatant
                            Youths). He planned measures to protect them economically as much as
                            possible. Further lamented cutoff of aid in flour and especially in
                            milk.</p>
                        <p>c. USG was entirely wrong in withholding subsidy for Special Forces.
                            These forces were not independent, as USG seemed to allege, but were
                            directly subordinated to <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> General
                            Staff, which had directed their use in action against pagodas August 21
                            after <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> senior officers had
                            unanimously told <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> such
                            action necessary. Added lamely that USG may have gotten false impression
                            of Special Forces independence because their particular type of mission
                            often involved them in action crossing normal division or corps sectors
                            borders.</p>

                            had gone, President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            said:</p>
                        <p>1. The Buddhist bonzes, spurred on by American agents and who, under
                            American stimulus, had created a so-called pagoda, have now received the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commission and have told them that
                            they were the victims of “intoxication” by Americans. (I would translate
                            the French word “intoxication” as “having been bulldozed by the
                            Americans”). In particular one bonze [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                not declassified</hi>] admitted the falsity of the document which
                            they had circulated and had attributed to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Another bonze [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 1ine not
                                declassified</hi>] admitted the false rumors of a coup d'etat which
                            he had started and cited a number of American names. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commission wanted to have the names.
                            Brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had suggested last
                            night that the American names be withheld because, after all, we were
                            allies and we did not want to wash our dirty linen in public. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would, however, furnish the Embassy
                            with the names.</p>
                        <p>2. I said that I hoped we would get the names and that he could be sure
                            that if any American had committed an impropriety, I would send him out
                            of the country.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> then spoke of a number of
                            small student groups who had been worked on by the Communists and who
                            intended to throw hand grenades and plastic bombs while the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commission was here. It was for this
                            reason that he had kept the universities closed. But as soon as the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commission leaves, the
                            universities will be opened “little by little” (“au fur et a
                            mesure”).</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> repeated what he said to
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> that the Special
                            Forces were really under the Joint General Staff and that it was a very
                            serious thing to cut off the Special Forces from the people who were
                            dependent upon the [garble] North Vietnam and who needed their support.
                            He said General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> is a
                            fine man but some of his advisors were not liked. He spoke particularly
                            of former American Colonel Vann whom he said was very imprudent.</p>
                        <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0543"/>
                        <p>5. Then he spoke about suggestions to change the government which was all
                            very well but who should be brought into the government? Whenever he
                            asked that, nobody could give him any names. Also the question of timing
                            was very important. He intended to do it at the proper time.</p>
                        <p>6. He hoped that when I was in Washington, I would ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and former Ambassador Nolting about brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> because the fact was that brother
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> did not wish power but
                            that he had such a flexible spirit and was always so full of good advice
                            that people would ask him for his advice. When they had a difficult
                            problem, brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would always
                            find a solution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> had
                            come to President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and had
                            said that it was too bad that brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was living in an ivory tower, he should go out more.
                            Ambassador Nolting had agreed and it was “due to their pressure” that
                            brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had started going out
                            and making himself known. But then when he did go out, people said he
                            was usurping power and it was then all the bad publicity began.</p>
                        <p>7. When I got up to go, he said: Please tell President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> that I am a good and a frank
                            ally, that I would rather be frank and settle questions now than talk
                            about them after we have lost everything. (This looked like a reference
                            to a possible coup.) Tell President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> that I take all his suggestions very seriously
                            and wish to carry them out but it is a question of timing.</p>
                        <p>8. Comment: I feel that this is another step in the dialogue which
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> thought <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had begun at our meeting in Dalat
                            on Sunday night.<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">See <ref target="#d221">Document 221</ref>.</note> If U.S. wants to make a package
                            deal, I would think we were in a position to do it. The conditions of my
                            return could be propitious for it. In effect he said: Tell us what you
                            want and we'll do it. Hope to discuss this in Washington. See also
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s statement on release of
                            all Buddhists and students now in jail.</p>
                        <p>On a personal basis, as soon as Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> had left the room, I said that I could assure
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that these rumors of
                            assassination had not in any way affected my feeling of admiration and
                            personal friendship for him or for Vietnam. I had long admired his
                            courage before coming to Saigon and since getting to know him, I formed
                            sentiments of friendship for him. I was grateful to him for being so
                            extremely nice to my wife and me. This was something which no amount of
                            false rumors could possibly affect.</p>

                        <p>1. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> presided throughout the meeting.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Vietnam.</hi>
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> opened the meeting by stating that “they”
                            (presumably himself and <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName>) had spent a quiet night watching the cables from
                            Vietnam. I asked how many forces were actually involved, hoping to draw
                            out some of <persName>Bundy</persName>'s thinking. He responded by
                            saying that, with the exception of the palace guard, the army in Saigon
                            and in the field seem to be firmly behind the Generals. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> added that it was a well
                            executed coup, much better than anyone would have thought possible.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> then commented that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was still holding out in the
                            palace, adding that no one wanted to go in for the kill. They preferred
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> leave the country. He
                            continued that the <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> trip is
                            obviously off, and concluded by saying that all we could do for the
                            present was continue to watch. At one point <persName corresp="#p_DRA1">Dungan</persName> jokingly said that if we recognized this military
                            regime quickly, it would put him in trouble in Latin America. Someone
                            responded that the group in Vietnam was “representative.”

                        <p>1. If coup succeeds, recognition problem will be urgent. Of course, you
                            would expect to deal in friendly and cooperative fashion with effective
                            authorities from the outset but timing of our announcement of formal
                            recognition might be delayed for brief period. Since coup is wholly
                            Vietnamese, Generals should understand that false recognition by the
                            United States in advance of other governments would falsely brand their
                            action as American-inspired and manipulated. Since Generals plan to
                            establish a government within two or three days, formal recognition
                            might better await that action.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> is of course free to
                            come and go as he pleases.</p>

                        <p>3. However, after studying reports of Embassy conversations with
                                <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> we are somewhat
                            uneasy about his political orientation and as to effects of his strong
                            anti-Catholic views on political stance of new government.</p>
                        <p>4. On balance we are inclined to believe intention coup group designate
                                <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> as Buddhist adviser
                            new government makes better sense than his inclusion in Cabinet as
                            minister with significant portfolio. Giving him specific
                            responsibilities limited to Buddhists has two advantages in our view,
                            (a) it reassures Buddhists; and (b) it does not frighten Catholics or
                            other groups which would be concerned by prospect overzealous Buddhist
                            reaction to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> repression. At same time, advisory
                            position for <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> with new
                            government would avail Generals <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                Quang</persName>'s considerable talents without prejudicing
                            non-denominational stance new government.</p>
                        <p>5. Regarding reftel, we assume Generals leading coup will not call on you
                            in large group, thus giving false impression they were reporting to
                            headquarters. A certain formality and correctness is greatly in their
                            interest in preserving Vietnamese character their action.</p>

                        <p>1. Instead of getting four hours or two days notice, we got approximately
                            four minutes. I returned from the airfield when in company with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> and others we said
                            goodbye to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>, had
                            lunch, and then back to the office. General <persName corresp="#p_SMGRG1">Stilwell</persName> came into the office about
                            1345 hrs and said he had just received a telephone call in the clear
                            from General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> saying that the
                            General had decided to move and to notify General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and his American friends.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_SMGRG1">Stilwell</persName> asked when
                            they were going to move. General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said immediately.”</p>
                        <p>2. At this time firing was reported in the vicinity of the Spec Fcs HQ
                            near Tan Son Nhut. Apparently <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            troops were closing in on the HQ in an effort to take Col Tung
                            prisoner.</p>
                        <p>3. Is now 1700 and during the afternoon there has been sporadic firing at
                            a couple of planes who did some very poor bombing if they were aiming at
                            the Palace. In fact, they hit our Embassy Marine House but apparently
                            nobody was hurt.</p>
                        <p>4. I just talked to the Ambassador. He said that <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> were trying to get in touch with
                            the President and ask him to resign and <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>
                            promised the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> safe conduct out of the country if they would
                            resign.</p>
                        <p>5. It is difficult to say at this time what the line-up of coup and
                            counter coup forces is. The <gloss target="#t_CNO1">CNO</gloss>, Captain
                            Quyen, was reported killed this morning. The paratroopers took over the
                            Navy HQ, put them on a ship and sent them down the river. The <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> has taken over the communications and
                            somebody else took over the civilian Police headquarters. The head of
                            the Air Force, the head of the Paratroopers, the head of the Marine
                            Brigade, the head of the Civil Guard, head of the Police force, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_LQTC1">Colonel Tung</persName> were all
                            prisoners in the Tan Son Nhut area. Unconfirmed.</p>
                        <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0549"/>
                        <p>6. At this time it is reported that the Palace is surrounded with the
                            troops in position to attack if attack is necessary.</p>
                        <p>7. Until this thing settles down I am requesting that visitors be
                            discouraged from coming to Vietnam. We don't know as of yet who the
                            military have picked for leaders on the civilian side. Brig Gen
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMGRG1">Stilwell</persName>'s house which is
                            next to the old Palace received a few bullet holes as the troops went by
                            on their way to Gia Long Palace. Betty<note n="2" xml:id="d267fn2">Mrs.

                            considerable shooting in the vicinity of my home though none of the
                            shooting has been directed at the house as yet. There is an antiaircraft
                            gun on the roof of the house across the street which has been quite
                            active.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> told Adm <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> and me that he was going to move
                            two <gloss target="#t_ABN1">ABN</gloss> battalions to Tay Ninh this
                            morning. However, the move was to Saigon rather than the two places he
                            indicated.</p>
                        <p>9. As of now it looks like we have two <gloss target="#t_ABN1">ABN</gloss>, two Marine and two <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> battalions in town with another parachute and <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> bn enroute from the training camp in
                            Vung Tau.</p>
                        <p>10. I have directed all US mil personnel to stay off the streets and not
                            to take sides. I have also directed that the main thing now is to watch
                            uprisings by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. I am sure they will
                            take advantage of this to create a series of acts of terrorism within
                            and without the city. All the police throughout the city have been
                            disarmed, yet the streets seem crowded with people. Other than that,
                            everything is quiet. All I can say is, there is never a dull moment here
                            in Saigon. Warm regards.</p>
                        <p>11. P.S. All is now quiet. Some heavy stuff. Sounds like tank fire has
                            just started. Oh me!!</p>

                            our warm thanks for a day of brilliantly quick reporting.</p>
                        <p>At 9:15 Washington time tomorrow morning, President will review position
                            and urgently asks your recommendations for this meeting. Our preliminary
                            thinking is that if current trends are continued we should move promptly
                            toward support and recognition, but this move will require careful
                            justification in light of danger of misleading comparisons in Latin
                            America. Our thought is to emphasize failings of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime in repression, loss of
                            popular support, inability to continue effective prosecution of war, and
                            even signs of desire to negotiate with enemy. By contrast, we expect to
                            emphasize prompt and evident popular support for what is in effect
                            movement by entire senior staff of Vietnamese armed forces, as well as
                            many well-known and respected civilian leaders, end of repression, and
                            aim toward prompt restoration of constitutional government. In this last
                            we believe position of Tho very important and hope it can be emphasized
                            there.</p>
                        <p>More immediately, we expect to background press this evening that this is
                            not a coup in the sense that it is merely the product of a few scheming
                            officers, but that day's events plainly show that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has yielded to virtually
                            unanimous determination of military and civilian leadership of his
                            country. In the context of civil war, this amounts to a <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0552"/>national decision. This last point is
                            of particular importance in underlining absurdity of notion that this
                            national decision could have been merely a foreigner's trick.</p>

                        <p>1. Agree we should move promptly to support and recognize. We should
                            decide to resume commercial import payments but on a periodic and
                            selective basis without public announcement so as to avoid appearance of
                            blank check or of pay-off. We should not be first to recognize but
                            should assure other friendly Embassies that this is our attitude that we
                            will recognize as soon as a few others have done so. We should, of
                            course, give unmistakable signs of our satisfaction to the new
                            leadership.</p>
                        <p>2. Believe the very great popularity of this coup should be stressed.
                            Every Vietnamese has a grin on his face today. Am told that the
                            jubilation in the streets exceeds that which comes every new year. The
                            Vietnamese employees at the Embassy Residence, whom I know well, have an
                            entirely different look on their face today. When I drove to the office
                            with a very small US flag flying, there were bursts of applause from the
                            sidewalk, people shaking hands and waving. The tanks which were standing
                            at the street corners were being covered with garlands of flowers and
                            the Army was evidently immensely popular with the people. At the big
                            circle in which [stands] the statue of the Trung sisters which was
                            modeled in the image of Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, young men were busy with acetylene torches cutting
                            the statues off at the feet and putting cables around the necks so as to
                            topple them to the ground.</p>
                        <p>3. Do not think the President should be identified with the story of the
                            desire of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime to
                            negotiate with the Army. I know of no hard evidence of such a
                            desire.</p>
                        <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0553"/>
                        <p>4. Otherwise line proposed in reftel seems satisfactory.</p>

                        <p>D. The threat to U.S. nationals is limited to the spill over from
                            fighting between coup forces and the Presidential Brigade in Saigon. To
                            a specific request, coup forces assented to free movement of U.S.
                            military personnel and guaranteed the security of U.S. installations.
                            There have been no restrictions except those realistically imposed by
                            sporadic fighting in Saigon and those prudently arising from the U.S.
                            declared Condition Yellow. We have not had a single report of
                            molestation of, or aloofness toward U.S. personnel. <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> officers at <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> Opns Center continue to pass all info freely to US

                            Coup.</p>
                        <p>Negative at this juncture. This is primary view and advisory personnel
                            being pressed for indicators.</p>

                        <p>It is too early to assess the effect of Saigon's own <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> forces and their operations against the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Obviously, forces engaged in the
                            coup in Saigon will not be available for field operations until the
                            course of the coup is run. However, the number of troops directly
                            involved is not large; aside from the general reserve battalions, only
                            gap created is in 5th Div tactical area. Further, the pro-coup
                            declarations of all corps commanders augur against spread of civil war
                            outside the national capital and therefore should preclude diversion of
                            I, II and IV Corps from counter-insurgency tasks. This is, of course,
                            highly speculative for there is no info available on reaction of
                            paramilitary forces (Civil Guard, <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>,
                            hamlet militia, or significantly, Republican Youth). However, The
                            fragmentation of paramilitary forces, by geography and organization
                            (company and lower) and the reality of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> threat in areas of deployment preclude coordinated or
                            massive counter action. We face the greater danger if the issue is long
                            delayed and the country left without clear political and military
                            leadership, for the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will certainly

                            locked up inside an Army vehicle. Due to an inadvertence there was a gun
                            inside the vehicle. It was with this gun, said <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName>, that they committed

                            Ngoc Thao said at 1130 November 2, that he, with his forces, had entered
                            Gia Long Palace in early morning hours for purpose of escorting

                            search, it was determined that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> were
                            not at Gia Long and had not been there during course of coup. Thao

                        <p>On November 2, 1963, the President held an off-the-record meeting at the
                            White House with his principal advisers on Vietnam from 9:35 to 10:05
                            a.m. The participants at the conference with the President were
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KRE1">Robert

                            (Kennedy Library, President's Log Book) <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> recounts that the meeting began with the fate of
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> still unknown, but <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Michael Forrestal</persName> brought in a copy of

                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> were dead and supposedly
                            had committed suicide. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            was apparently referring to a White House copy of <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Saigon Critic telegram 22, November 2,

                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> described the President's
                            reaction as follows:</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> leaped to his feet and
                            rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face which I
                            had never seen before. He had always insisted that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> must never suffer more than exile
                            and had been led to believe or had persuaded himself that a change in
                            government could be carried out without bloodshed.” (<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, Swords and Plowshares, page

                        <p>Arthur <persName corresp="#p_SAJ1">Schlesinger</persName> related that he
                            saw the President “soon after he heard that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> were
                            dead.” <persName corresp="#p_SAJ1">Schlesinger</persName> confirmed
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s impression that the
                            President was “somber and shaken” and looking more depressed than he had
                            been since the Bay of Pigs invasion. According to <persName corresp="#p_SAJ1">Schlesinger</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> doubted that the Ngo brothers,
                            as practicing Catholics, would have committed suicide and he felt that,
                            after 20 years of service to South Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s life should not have ended as it did. (<persName corresp="#p_SAJ1">Schlesinger</persName>, Thousand Days, pages

                        <p>Later in the day, the President held another off-the-record meeting on
                            Vietnam with most of the same people. The meeting lasted from 4:30 to
                            5:35 p.m. and no record has been found of the discussion. (Kennedy

                        <p>1. We are no 1onger a republic.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime has
                            fallen and the President and Counsellor are in the custody of the
                            General Committee at an undisclosed location. We fix the time of the
                            surrender of the Palace at 020600H. While the issue was fairly clear
                            late last night, it took a heavy assault on the Palace, by a much
                            superior force, to bring capitulation. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was stubborn to the end; in fact when <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>, as tactical commander, got the
                            President on the telephone at 0600H, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> demanded the immediate surrender of the coup
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>2. During the evening of 1 November, the coup forces systematically
                            reduced the Presidential Guard barracks, took its defenders prisoner and
                            moved troops into position ringing the Palace garrison (estimated at
                            1000 and 4 armored vehicles). While Palace was subjected to harassing
                            fire from initiation of coup, it was made clear that an assault would
                            begin at midnight if no surrender forthcoming. Heavy pounding actually
                            started around 0400. At this juncture, we still lack estimates of
                            casualties, except for those involved in defense of the Presidential
                            Guard barracks, I believe casualties to be light. At least 5 tanks were
                            hit and burned in the vicinity of the Palace. No U.S. casualties as yet
                            reported.</p>

                            the logical choice until a stronger man appears-I shall push the

                            as possible, the ministerial posts they have assumed. The nonappearance

                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> 4279-63. 1. Out of the present
                            turbulence in Saigon we all hopeful will emerge a strong government able
                            to prosecute the war with improved effectiveness. I am sure that you are
                            thinking of all the changes and improvements which we might desire for
                            the military apparatus. I have in mind such things as the establishment
                            of a clear channel of command and more effective relationships between
                            field commanders and province chiefs. I would appreciate knowing what
                            you have in mind in the way of military improvements to be sought from
                            the new government.</p>
                        <p>2. Related to the above is my concern over the possible adverse effect of
                            the change in administration on the province chiefs. My impression is
                            that we are generally satisfied with these men, who are now performing a
                            very important military role in the conduct of the war. Do you consider
                            that there is any likelihood of a wholesale replacement of present
                            incumbents based on their prior relationships with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government? It is clearly in our
                            interest to prevent removal of effective and experienced chiefs.</p>

                        <p>833. 1. We now expect to recognize new regime in Saigon early next week.
                            All missions, especially in Western Hemisphere, should be prepared to
                            give full explanation this decision and sharp distinction between its
                            basis and USG opposition to military coups against democratic regimes
                            elsewhere. Elements of difference are these:</p>
                        <p>(1) <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime had become
                            instrument of complete personal authority of one family.</p>
                        <p>(2) <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime was deeply
                            opposed not merely by mass of people but increasingly by its own senior
                            officials, civilian and military</p>
                        <p>(3) Regime was increasingly incapable of giving effective direction to
                            national effort against Communist subversion and aggression.</p>
                        <p>2. By contrast, the following can already be said about the government of
                            military men and leading civilians which is now in control:</p>
                        <p>(1) This government rapidly reversing previous regime's repression and
                            has evident and general popular support.</p>
                        <p>(2) Its declared policy is to transfer political power, in the near
                            future, to a popularly elected government responsive to the will of the
                            entire people.</p>
                        <p>(3) It is rallying the nation for renewed prosecution of its war against
                            Communist aggression.</p>
                        <p>(4) This government, with the death of President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, has in its leadership his
                            constitutional successor, Vice President Tho. (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Tho appears to be slated for Prime Minister's role,
                            but exact status still uncertain.)</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, whatever their failings,
                            has caused shock here and there is danger that standing and reputation
                            of incoming government may be significantly damaged if conviction
                            spreads of their assassination at direction of one or more senior
                            members of incoming regime. Evidence available here is thin and
                            conflicting, but simple assertion of suicide obviously will not end the
                            matter. We believe that it is deeply in the interest of the regime to
                            make prompt and full explanation, and if the deaths not by suicide, to
                            emphasize with clear evidence all mitigating circumstances. They should
                            not be left under illusion that political assassination is easily
                            accepted here. Across the months of repression and increasing
                            ineffectiveness, American people and government remember great services
                            to freedom rendered by <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> over
                            many years.</p>

                            with neighboring countries offers encouraging prospects. Following
                            preliminary views are offered for comment addressees:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cambodia</p>
                        <p>Possibility of improved <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> relations particularly attractive as it
                            might lead to <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> cooperating in
                            preventing Viet Cong infiltration and smuggling. It might also create
                            more relaxed atmosphere conducive to resolution various specific
                            differences such as those involving frontiers. Moreover, improved
                            Cambodian relations with a new, more responsive Vietnamese regime,
                            coupled with Cambodian awareness of US benign, special relationship with
                            new regime, might gradually bolster Sihanouk's confidence in future of
                            Free World in Southeast Asia and reduce his [<hi rend="italic">less than
                                1 line not declassified</hi>] fear of his neighbors.</p>
                        <p>Initiative for re-establishment relations probably must come form <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> which took initiative in severance, but
                            new Vietnamese regime could do much, particularly in first few days and
                            weeks of its tenure to encourage <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> this direction. It would be particularly
                            desirable at this time to take special precautions to prevent any new
                            border incidents or overflights. Department does not, however, believe
                            it would be wise for U.S. at this time to take initiative to urge <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> to resume relations since this would
                            probably be misinterpreted as evidence new regime will be a puppet of
                            U.S. Embassy Phnom Penh should however take advantage of ordinary
                            contact with Cambodians to provide <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0565"/>as much helpful background on developments in Saigon as
                            possible and to express hope that under new circumstances relations will
                            improve</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">For Saigon</hi>: Request you consider what would be
                            proper timing to send EmbOff to Phnom Penh with backup materials to

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Thailand</p>
                        <p>There appears to be no reason to doubt that Thai Govt will be inclined at
                            least initially to be friendly toward new Viet regime, particularly in
                            view recent Thai concern trend of events in <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime. Thai Govt will no doubt welcome it as one
                            which promises to maintain war effort against Viet Cong while
                            strengthening political situation at home. It is to be hoped that RTG
                            will move quickly toward recognition new Viet regime and that it will
                            develop closer relations than it had with former government. Expression
                            of greater Thai interest in Vietnamese war effort would not only be
                            encouraging to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> but might be
                            instructive to Thai military regarding problems which they may face at
                            some time in future. Embassy Bangkok should accordingly in its
                            discretion point out to Thai importance of forthcoming attitude on their

                        <p>There seems to be no reason to believe that Thai would oppose a closer
                            relationship between <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> provided of course that Viet regime
                            maintains its basic pro-Free World alignment. At same time it might be
                            pointed out to Thai that new fluid situation created by change in
                            Viet-Nam provides many opportunities for strengthening Free World in

                            especially timely now for resumption Thai-Cambodian relations since if

                            simultaneously presented with real possibility of closer, more friendly

                            orientation might be slowly but fundamentally influenced. Therefore,
                            while recognizing that Thailand has shown great patience with <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s outbursts, it might be
                            useful that Thailand would be willing to ignore these outbursts at this
                            time and re-double efforts to bring to a successful conclusion its

                        <p>3. From all outward appearances, there is strong public support of the
                            Armed Forces and the new govt those forces have established. The mood of
                            the population is jubilant, by Vietnamese standards rapport between
                            troops and people is excellent; everywhere, people are bringing food to

                            but the streets are crowded; this is, of course, Saturday and a holiday

                            developments combined with a national holiday, the tempo of offensive

                        <p>2. It recognized here that it will take several days to re-focus the
                            attention of the new government on priority military tasks. The
                            attention of the entire higher command structure is now centered upon
                            the most pressing of all immediate problems: the establishment of a
                            viable government. There is also an impact upon field commanders,
                            particularly sector commanders who face, in varying degrees, personal
                            and political reorientation.</p>

                            explained that General “Big” <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> was tied up in conference with V.P. Tho.) After my

                            assistance they asked me if I had any questions.</p>
                        <p>1. I asked whether they were planning a statement which would absolve
                            themselves from the assassination of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.
                            They had not thought of making statement, but obviously agreed that they
                            should make it clear that they had offered Diem safe passage out of the
                            country if he would resign; that they deeply deplored the assassination;
                            that the assassination had not only not been in any way ordered by them
                            but was contrary to their wishes and was, unfortunately, the kind of
                            thing which will happen in a coup d'etat when order cannot be guaranteed
                            everywhere. I am sure assassination was not at their direction. For your
                            information, I believe this is the most that you can expect of them and
                            that when they make a statement like this it ought to be welcomed in
                            Washington. Burial and funeral of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            would be family matter. Bodies would be in vault in cemetery here and
                            would be taken to family vault in Hue later.</p>
                        <p>2. I asked whether they had any ideas in mind concerning the relations
                            between the United States and the Government of Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said, with a big grin, “Certainly
                            and we would like to start getting milk and flour for free sale
                            immediately and, of course, the restoration of economic aid.” (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>, I hope that this can be done
                            promptly.) <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said that for
                            psychological reasons they planned to lift immediately restrictions on
                            sale of milk in cafes, etc., which were recently instituted by <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime.</p>
                        <p>3. I then asked what kind of a government they planned to have—a military
                            committee or successor government, or what. General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>, who did most of the talking, said
                            that three solutions had occurred to the group. The first was a straight
                            out military junta, the second was a government with a military
                            majority, and the third was a government in which the military had only
                            a slight interest. And the third was the kind of government on which
                            they decided. In this there was a military committee which was presided
                            over by General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>.</p>

                            of some fifteen ministers, of which four or five would be military. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> would be Prime Minister.
                            When I asked why it would not be more astute for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> to have the title of President
                            rather than the title of Prime Minister inasmuch as his powers were
                            going to be the same in either event and that it would make it look like
                            less of an abrupt transition, they said that the title of President had
                            been reserved for General Minh as President of the Military Committee,
                            who would be a ceremonial head. They said they would be willing to call
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> President of the Council
                            in the French style rather than Prime Minister. I did not see much
                            advantage in that. They said this would be a provisional government
                            which would last six months and even longer but certainly not two years.
                            They would have a provisional constitution and the present constitution
                            was suspended. They seemed to be completely decided that this was how
                            they were going to do it.</p>
                        <p>4. I then asked them whether the Generals were going to stay united and
                            win the war? This seemed to move them both. They said they had been
                            divided a long time and knew from bitter experience what it costs to be
                            divided. General <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">“Big” Minh</persName>
                            now is their leader. They would do everything possible to be united. The
                            army needs a much more aggressive morale than it has. Even <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had said the Army did not have as
                            much drive as it should have, and he was responsible for many of the
                            troubles. They would bend over backwards to stay united. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said that he was Vice President of
                            the Committee and <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> Second
                            Vice President.</p>
                        <p>5. I asked about safe passage for the <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> children and for the members of the family to exile.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said he would
                            personally take it in charge. They planned to take the <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> children in Vietnam, who were three
                            in number, and who had been in Dalat when the coup occurred, and give
                            them over to Madame Dung, the niece of Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. They were now in Phan Pang. I
                            suggested that when everything was ready and the children were all set
                            to go that this be announced to the press. This struck them as a good
                            idea, although they evidently had not thought about it at all.</p>
                        <p>6. I asked them about the people who had been arrested and the previous
                            ministers—whether they would receive humane treatment. They said that no
                            previous ministers had been arrested. In fact, they didn't know that
                            anybody of that rank had been arrested. I spoke about Mr. Thiep, who is
                            well known in international parliamentary circles and who had been
                            picked up last night, and whose wife was frantic. General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> made a note of the name and said he
                            would look into it. They would all get humane treatment.</p>
                        <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0574"/>
                        <p>7. I then asked about <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>.
                            They said of course he would be safe. As their group was completely
                            committed to religious freedom, they would like to not have him just
                            slip out of the Embassy quietly without some kind of ceremony for him.
                            At the end of the meeting I took them down to the 2nd floor to see
                                <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> and after a long
                            consultation it was decided that <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                Quang</persName> would walk quietly out of the building tomorrow and
                            if they want to have a ceremony for him, they can have it somewhere
                            else, not in front of the Embassy. <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> said they had in mind making <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> a member of a council of wise
                            men, which would advise <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big
                                Minh</persName>.</p>
                        <p>8. I asked about reprisals and purges and expressed the hope that there
                            would be no wholesale purges but that reprehensible individuals would be
                            dealt with as special cases. They said that, except for incompetents,
                            they wanted everybody below the rank of minister to stay on and in fact
                            they would like to have the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            Cabinet, most of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            Cabinet, come back to their posts in order to assure continuity.</p>
                        <p>9. I asked about the lifting of curfew and restoration of dancing. They
                            said dancing could be restored at once but they would keep curfew on for
                            another two days. They said the United Nations Commission, together with
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName>, was leaving
                            today.</p>
                        <p>10. I said I much wanted an exit visa for Mrs. Gregory so that she could
                            leave the country [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>]. They
                            said they would gladly provide it.</p>
                        <p>11. On the matter of censorship, General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> said that at a press conference yesterday he said he
                            wouldn't be a demagogue and say there would be no censorship but there
                            would be as little as possible and that he wanted to facilitate any
                            difficulties and hoped they would all telephone him if anything went
                            wrong. So far he had had no telephone calls. He also asked me to call
                            him personally if I heard of difficulties on this score.</p>
                        <p>12. They said of course they would assume all international obligations
                            and I said that I was sure recognition would not be long in coming.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> asked me my opinion
                            [garble—of?] Thuan of whose whereabouts he said he was ignorant. I
                            praised him highly: character, intelligence, understanding of other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>14. He said <gloss target="#t_AMB1">Amb</gloss>. Chuong wanted to come
                            home and be part of the government, but they didn't want Madame Chuong
                            back in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>They were extremely frank and forthcoming in all their answers and we did
                            more business in fifteen minutes than we used to be able to do at the
                            Palace in four hours. They expressed warm thanks to me for not
                            thwarting, for not giving up <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                Quang</persName>, for my general attitude; and it was clear
                            throughout that the withholding of commercial imports <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0575"/>had a tremendous psychological effect.
                            They said their coup was organized without a single piece of paper
                            having been kept. All papers were burned; everything was memorized.</p>

                            the past, specifically:</p>
                        <p>a. Direct chain of command.</p>
                        <p>b. Subordination of prov chief to corps and div comdrs in military
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>c. Emphasis on the trng of units, including hamlet militia (and militia
                            squad leaders).</p>
                        <p>d. Opnl use of gen reserve.</p>
                        <p>e. Opnl use of Special Forces under <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss>
                            and corps comdrs (now reported accomplished).</p>
                        <p>f. Better use of military engineers.</p>
                        <p>g. Better use of Navy and Civil Guard boat companies in Delta.</p>
                        <p>h. Lifting of restrictions on aircraft armament.</p>
                        <p>I. Increased tempo of opns with emphasis on those types of opns which
                            augur success of desired objectives.</p>
                        <p>J. Freeing of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> elements from static
                            security missions and reduction isolated outposts.</p>
                        <p>3. All of the above have previously been discussed with military leaders
                            who were responsive to the need for such improvements and I anticipate
                            that they, functioning under the new govt structure, will be inclined to
                            institute desired changes.</p>
                        <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0576"/>
                        <p>4. As concerns the effect of the change in administration on the province
                            chiefs I do not have at this time details on country-wide reaction of
                            these very important individuals. Am in the process of assembling info
                            on this point and will report in detail soonest. As a general response
                            to your query and based on info presently available.</p>
                        <p>a. As a general rule, with some exceptions, we have been satisfied with
                            current line up in so far as their military duties are concerned.</p>
                        <p>b. Do not anticipate any wholesale shakeup of present incumbents.</p>
                        <p>c. Agree that it to our best interests to prevent removal of effective or
                            experienced chiefs, and to experience the minimum of changes.</p>
                        <p>d. Several prov chiefs have to date declared their allegiance to the new
                            govt. Consolidated list being assembled and will be forwarded ASAP.</p>
                        <p>e. Have reed info of temp replacement two (2) prov chiefs in I Corps.</p>

                        <p>1. Several developments in aftermath coup creating serious concern here.
                            Suggest you arrange see General Duong Van Minh for prompt discussion of
                            following:</p>
                        <p>2. Reports of manner death of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            (shot and stabbed with gory details) carried in press headlines and
                            causing considerable shock here. When pictures bodies reach U.S., effect
                            will be even worse.</p>
                        <p>Urgent that prompt and complete clarifying statement be made.
                            Clarification described in your 900 should be expanded with full account
                            of arrangements for safe passage and safe removal <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> from palace. We do not think there should be any
                            suggestion that <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0577"/>this is just
                            the sort of thing you have to expect in a coup. On the contrary,
                            Generals should emphasize extensive efforts we understand they made to
                            prevent this result.</p>
                        <p>3. Mme. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has issued long,
                            bitter statement in effect holding U.S. responsible for coup, using such
                            phrases as “cruel treachery”, “treason” and “dirty crime.” Statement and
                            reaction to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> deaths accentuate importance of
                            assuring safety <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> children. We
                            trust intentions expressed to you by <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> re children and other members
                                Ngo family will be carried out. Prompt and
                            chivalrous treatment of children will be particularly helpful here in
                            context of death of father.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HM1">Marguerite Higgins</persName> has contacted

                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> asking that children be
                            brought out to Rome. Suggest you arrange transportation for this
                            purpose. Use military aircraft if necessary.</p>
                        <p>4. Deeply disturbed by reports arrests of Tran Quoc Buu and Nguyen Phuong
                            Thiep. We consider it of highest importance that new regime immediately
                            release them and avoid further actions directed toward personalities who
                            apparently not guilty any crimes.</p>
                        <p>Suggest you point out these developments at minimum give appearance
                            military not in full control of situation and unless promptly corrected
                            will produce strong adverse international reaction contrary to regime's
                            desire attract international sympathy. Thiep well-known in U.S.

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Indicators of Coup Success.</p>
                        <p>1. Very little to add to evaluation contained Ref B. There have been no
                            counter-coup actions reported, anywhere in the nation, during the past
                            24 hours. The junta is definitely in control of the situation, at this
                            juncture.</p>
                        <p>2. Mood of the Saigon population remains exuberant.</p>
                        <p>3. Information is scanty in the following areas:</p>
                        <p>a. Specific moves to eliminate secret apparatus of the Can Lao Party. The
                            only arrests of which we are aware are, in addition to Colonel <persName corresp="#p_LQTC1">Le Quang Tung</persName> and brother Trieu (both
                            rumored dead), a handful of Vietnamese Special Forces officers. General
                            Cao has been relieved but not clear yet whether reason was political
                            unreliability or military incompetence.</p>
                        <p>b. Extent to which wholehearted support and participation of influential
                            civilian leaders and institutions has been gained.</p>
                        <p>4. The junta appears genuinely concerned over possibility of some
                            pre-arranged counter-coup action; and thus considers next 48 hours or so
                            to be crucial. Conceivably, counter-coup action could be stimulated by
                            Republican Youth, elements of Special Forces not yet accounted for or
                            other instrumentalities of Can Lao Party. We consider likelihood of
                            large scale action to be remote; however terroristic acts are distinctly
                            possible.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Status of Public Order.</p>
                        <p>1. The street and squares are alive with people, today. Old hands report
                            that population notable for numbers in evidence, and for relaxed
                            attitude.</p>
                        <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0579"/>
                        <p>2. No further indications of ransacking residences or offices closely
                            associated with the Ngo family or regime. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> appealed to the
                            population to be circumspect in this regard; considerable numbers of
                            troops deployed throughout the city to enforce injunction, if necessary;
                            their mere presence suffices. In this connection, people appear
                            reassured by, rather than fearful of, presence of troops.</p>
                        <p>3. General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> reports that Saigon
                            civil police force has been reconstituted at nearly pre-coup strength;
                            that, given assurances, the great bulk of those who left their posts in
                            fear on Friday have returned to duty. In this regard, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> expressed high confidence in
                            General <persName corresp="#p_XUAN1">Xuan</persName> (Director General

                        <p>4. Public utilities continue to function uninterruptedly.</p>

                        <p>1. Following are changes or additions to previous reports:</p>
                        <p>a. Major General Tran Van Don will be both Minister of National Defense
                            and Chief, Joint General Staff. He plans to discharge both

                            relinquish command of III Corps in next few days. Logical successor (and
                            best choice) would be Brigadier General Co. However current information
                            is that nod will go to Brigadier General <persName corresp="#p_NVTC1">Thieu</persName>, Commander, 5th Div and key figure in coup.</p>
                        <p>e. Colonel Nhon (expected to be promoted 4 November) has assumed command
                            IV Corps. Vice General Cao reported Nhon will be replaced at 21st
                            Division by Colonel Han (former Chief of Staff, IV Corps).</p>
                        <p>f. No further changes reported on division commanders.</p>

                        <p>2. Additional promotions:</p>
                        <p>a. To Major General: <persName corresp="#p_LVKBG1">Le Van Kim</persName>
                            (Minister of Agriculture designate), General Tran Thieu Oai (Director of

                            about some reaction by elements still loyal to former regime.</p>
                        <p>3. No reports, from any quarter, of hostility toward or action against
                            any U.S. personnel.</p>

                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> assessment is that there has
                            been no significant change in pattern of VC incidents since initiation
                            of coup.</p>

                        <p>1. As expected, today was a duplicate of yesterday. No deployments from

                            resumed tactical operations. Minds of senior military still concentrated
                            on structuring and policies of government.</p>
                        <p>2. The hope is for early upsurge in tempo and effectiveness of the
                            military counterinsurgency efforts. General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> passed assurance to <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> via J-3 that troops would be returned to field

                            promulgated tomorrow. Expected that powers of state will be temporarily
                            vested in a committee (<persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>
                            referred to a praesidium) with Duong Van Minh as chairman and from which
                            the ministries would depend.</p>
                        <p>2. As a minimum, Ministries of Defense (<persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>), Home Affairs (formerly Interior) (<persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>), Education (Tran Van Minh),
                            Agriculture (<persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>), Information
                            (Oai) to be military incumbents, at outset. Promise is to relinquish all
                            as soon as responsible civilian replacements can be found.</p>
                        <p>3. Thus far, only the province chiefs of the two northernmost provinces
                            have been replaced. However, the odds are for more widespread change.
                            The probable formula will be an arrangement which separates military
                            (security) and civil responsibilities.</p>

                        <p>1. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> presided throughout the meeting.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">Here follows discussion of matters unrelated to
                                Vietnam.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>3. Vietnam. The coup in Vietnam was the subject of a somewhat rambling
                            discussion which focused mainly on the problem of recognition but also
                            touched on a number of other points.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> made it clear that we would recognize the
                            government in the next day or two. He asked that this word be gotten to
                            the American Republics Section of the State Department because he knew
                            that cables were already coming in from Latin American countries which
                            pointed up how our recognition policy in Vietnam appeared to differ from
                            that in Latin America. Cooper of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            suggested this might be a good time to spell out US recognition policy.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> replied he was enough of a diplomatic
                            historian to know that if a government did this it would certainly be in
                            trouble, because the approach to recognition changed with
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAJ1">Schlesinger</persName> said we must
                            recognize that our recognition policy toward Latin America is different
                            from our policy in other parts of the world because of our special
                            responsibilities. He admitted that our recent emphasis on
                            constitutionality of governments in Latin America could be jeopardized
                            by our recognition of the Vietnamese coup and tried to draw a
                            distinction between the Far East situation and the one in Latin America.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> commented that he was sympathetic with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAJ1">Schlesinger</persName>'s approach, but
                            what it seemed to amount to was, if we liked people, we would say what
                            they did was constitutional and if we didn't we would not. After a bit
                            more discussion, there seemed to be a consensus that the two criteria
                            for recognition should be (1) an effective government, and (2) one that
                            has the support of the people. This approach will avoid the strict legal
                            approach to recognition and avoids centering our policy solely on
                            constitutionality and legitimacy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> said that he had no intention of making
                            publicly any clear-cut statements along the lines above, but he did
                            think it might be a good idea for the President to have a press
                            conference this week<note n="2" xml:id="d288fn2">The President held a
                                press conference on November 14; for the transcript, which includes

                            explain our attitude toward the Vietnamese coup and, in process, draw
                            some distinctions between the various types of military revolts. He
                            asked Gordon Chase to compile the President's previous statements on
                            recognition.</p>
                        <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0582"/>
                        <p>One interesting sidelight is the importance of a coup having the support
                            of the people. <persName>Bundy</persName> and others were impressed with
                            the fact that the Saigonese people threw garlands of roses on the tanks
                            and seemed genuinely pleased with the revolt. In contrasting this with
                            certain Latin American military coupe, <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            remarked that Latin American generals would do well to plan for some
                            such demonstration of support. He made the remark half jokingly, but he
                            was serious in noting that such things were important. Given my
                            suspicious mind, I wondered if all the local support in Saigon was
                            spontaneous or whether some of it had been arranged.</p>
                        <p>At one point, the discussion turned on what was the determining factor in
                            bringing about the coup. The subject came up when, in talking of
                            recognition, Bundy said that perhaps we should have a policy of showing
                            our support for various governments not by mere recognition, but by
                            willingness to provide them economic and military assistance. In
                            discussing the effectiveness of such assistance,
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> remarked that he thought cutting off the
                            commodity support program in Vietnam was probably the determining factor
                            in bringing about the revolt at this time. Forrestal agreed. Hansen of
                            BOB, however, took a somewhat different view, saying that the verbal
                            pressure we had put on also had some effect, and was probably the most
                            important thing we did. There followed some discussion which came down
                            to the fact that our cutting off assistance to the special forces and
                            cutting the commodity support program were two actions that showed that
                            we meant business with our words. The primary point Hansen was trying to
                            make never became clear, but I think it probably stemmed from the fact
                            that, as a budgeteer, he would not like to see the assistance programs
                            manipulated in every crisis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> deplored the slaying of the brothers
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, and said the evidence
                            was mounting that they were assassinated. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            remarked there are supposedly some pictures which will soon appear
                            publicly, showing the brothers in a pool of blood with their hands tied
                            behind their backs. <persName>Bundy</persName> said this was not the
                            preferred way to commit suicide, and regretted that the coup leaders
                            still insisted that it was.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the government of Vietnam, <persName>Bundy</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> agreed that perhaps
                            a provisional government would be preferred over a period of months
                            rather than settling in for a long time with a more constitutional
                            government of less effective people. These remarks were related to the
                            difficulty of getting good civilians in the cabinet.</p>

                        <p>1. On 4 Nov <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> source close to General
                            Tran Van Minh reported that <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>
                            said that former Minister of Finance, Ha Van Vuong, and former Minister
                            of Agriculture Le Van Dong, of two years ago, told <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> that the Generals are quarreling
                            among themselves. They also say that if the Generals cannot come to an
                            agreement within next day then the Marines who actually led the coup
                            against the regime would lead a countercoup.</p>
                        <p>2. According to <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, these
                            several items are contributing to the discord among the Generals:</p>
                        <p>None of the Generals is jubilant over the murder of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. General <persName corresp="#p_NKMG1">Nguyen Khanh</persName>'s only stipulation for
                            joining the coup was that the President would not be killed. Generals
                            were in agreement that as little bloodshed as possible was to take
                            place. General Duong Van Minh issued orders that only fire fights on
                            given objectives were to take place and property was not to be
                            destroyed. Little <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> says the
                            Generals are very disturbed over the looting that has taken place.
                            Another point of disagreement among Generals is the manner in which
                            promotions were handled. Duong Van Minh passed approving of promotions
                            to <persName corresp="#p_TVDMG1">Tran Van Don</persName>. Tran Van Minh
                            and <persName corresp="#p_NNTV1">Nguyen Ngoc Le</persName> thought some
                            of the Generals' promotions should be held up for the moment. At this
                            point, <persName corresp="#p_TVDMG1">Tran Van Don</persName> passed
                            approval promotions to <persName corresp="#p_TTKG1">Tran Thien
                                Khiem</persName>, who announced the promotions including his own.
                            Former Vice President Tho who was party to promotion discussion was very
                            disturbed over manner promotions.</p>
                        <p>3. Last meeting of Generals discontinued at 0300 hrs 4 Nov and to be
                            continued sometime after 1300 4 Nov. Generals have not been able to come
                            to agreement on Cabinet. The major deterrent in coming to agreement
                            centers around General <persName corresp="#p_TTDMG1">Ton That
                                Dinh</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> who
                            figured among the primary coup movers and, according to Little <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, carries some weight with Duong
                            Van Minh, wants to be Minister of Interior. Former Vice President
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> objected strongly to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> taking this position.
                            Also, several Generals are concerned over <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>'s second demand that newly appointed General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DMC1">Do Mau</persName> be made Minister of

                            suggested compromise by moving some of Interior's functions into
                            Ministry Administrative Affairs to Prime Minister [sic] and in essence
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> would hold the portfolio

                        <p>5. At the close of the meeting, it appeared that only four of the
                            Generals had to be ministers. They were Defense/<persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, Interior/<persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>, Information/<persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>, and Youth/Maul</p>

                            together Cabinet but they must be sensible about it. They received only
                            shrug of shoulders from Duong Van Minh. At this point, Vice President
                            Tho pulled Tran Van Minh aside and said don't be discouraged that he,
                            Tho, would try to help and that he thought Tran Van Minh's counsel very
                            valuable.</p>

                        <p>1. I had it from an unimpeachable source that the bodies of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> were returned to the families and that they are now
                            in the morgue at St. Paul's Hospital. The source which has seen the

                            of having been beaten up. This definitely disproves the rumor of

                        <p>3. According to General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, they
                            called <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> shortly after 4:30

                            in a vehicle with two aides and drove to Cholon and went into a house
                            which they had long since prepared and from where they could be reached
                            by telephone from the Palace and could make outgoing telephone calls
                            themselves. General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> and his
                            associates wanted very much to get them out of the country safe and
                            sound, and no one deplored their assassinations more than he does. They
                            provided an armored car so that they would not be lynched.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> told me last night that
                            there was an Indian astrologer who was here a few weeks ago who
                            predicted a “frightful massacre” of a “great family”. The respect with
                            which he and former Economics Minister and Finance Minister considered
                            this prediction confirmed the reports I have always heard of the
                            prestige which astrologers have in this part of the world.</p>

                        <p>1. I began by saying we had made preliminary arrangements for resumption
                            of milk and flour deliveries and asked who should be <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName>'s contact in the Vietnamese
                            Government for discussion of this and other aid matters.</p>
                        <p>2. They said that the new government was going to be announced later in
                            the day and that <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName> could deal
                            with the appropriate minister.</p>
                        <p>3. I stressed repeatedly the importance of publishing a very complete and
                            detailed account of their efforts to arrange safe passage for <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>; their repeated telephone calls and urgings to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to resign; and the

                            would not be lynched on the way out of the Palace. Like many people in
                            this part of the world, they do not appreciate the importance of public
                            relations, but I think maybe I made a dent.</p>
                        <p>4. I then stressed the importance of getting the <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> children out soonest and was told
                            that they were now in Saigon and that the Generals, too, wanted to get

                            all his many cruelties in the past and that the crowd wanted his skin. I
                            asked whether or not Can wanted to leave his mother and the country, and
                            they did not know. This is an exceedingly puzzling question. It would
                            obviously be very bad if Can were lynched. It would also be bad if we
                            tore him away from his mother.<note n="3" xml:id="d291fn3">In telegram

                            regarding the whereabouts of Tran Quoc Buu, the labor leader. Each
                            member of the Generals' council specifically interrogated, and they are
                            absolutely definite that none of them had taken any steps to have him
                            arrested. They say that he is not in any police station; that he was not
                            arrested but has been kidnapped and is now in some private house. They
                            are continuing the search. (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>—Believe

                            government says that this man was not “arrested” but has been
                            kidnapped.)</p>
                        <p>7. They said that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_TUYEN1">Tuyen</persName> had
                            resumed to Saigon from Hong Kong via Bangkok and had at once started
                            pulling his old plotting organization together. They suspect him of
                            having engineered the kidnapping of <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu</persName> in order to make trouble for the new government and
                            put it in wrong with the world labor movement.</p>
                        <p>8. I repeatedly stressed the importance of the Generals keeping united
                            and going out and winning the war and not getting a reputation for
                            arbitrary arrests, which would damage their ability to win the war as it
                            had damaged that of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            regime.</p>

                            enough to get on top of things?</p>
                        <p>10. <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 704<note n="5" xml:id="d291fn5">
                                <ref target="#d286">Document 286</ref>.</note> seems to show some
                            divergence between ourselves and yourselves on significance and merit of
                            the coup. Here is how it looks to us:</p>
                        <p>a. To whomever has ever been involved in either a military or a political
                            campaign, this coup appears to have been a remarkably able performance
                            in both respects. To mention but one out of [many] features, the way in
                            which secrecy was preserved and no papers of any <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0588"/>kind were used during and preceding
                            operations might be profitably studied by any organization in which
                            leaks and a superfluity of paper are problems. The concentration of
                            effort on switchboards, radio stations and communications facilities
                            showed a realism not possessed, for example, by those who attempted the
                            coup against Hitler.</p>
                        <p>b. Experts who have all along been hostile to the coup and who said “win
                            with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>” now say that this
                            coup means that the war can be drastically shortened. One observer,
                            watching the performance of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>,
                            said if these men can perform like this when their hearts are in it, why
                            isn't it reasonable to believe that they can do equally well against the
                            Viet Cong?</p>
                        <p>c. I quite agree that Generals should make clear that they were opposed
                            to any harm coming to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and that the rest of the
                                Ngo family will be humanely treated. I
                            recognize that these Generals will make mistakes, and I hope they don't
                            start arbitrary arrests and fighting among themselves. Also I am doing
                            everything I can for <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu</persName> and
                            Thiep. But this is only way these people can get a change—which they are
                            very happy about.</p>
                        <p>d. And we should not overlook what this coup can mean in the way of
                            shortening the war and enabling Americans to come home. Hope we can get
                            solidly behind the new crowd and give them a real chance.</p>

                            General Do Cao Tri. One of Can's emissaries today reported Can appeared
                            desperate this morning and was ready seek asylum at Consulate as soon as
                            emissary gave go ahead.<note n="2" xml:id="d292fn2">On the afternoon of

                                assistance if Can's life were to be placed in danger. U.S. officials
                                replied that Can could only be helped if he was in “imminent danger
                                from mob violence” and pointed out that the Consulate's premises
                                were not inviolable. If asked by Government of Vietnam authorities
                                to turn him over, the Consul would have to comply. (Telegram 12 from

                            Another of Can's emissaries reported Can would like his mother and one
                            servant to come with him. Mother, incidentally, rumored to possibly have
                            died today, or at least to be failing quickly. As far as it is known,
                            she remains in her own residence.</p>
                        <p>In telegram 5 to Hue, November 2, the Department instructed the Consul to
                            grant Can asylum at his request if he was in physical danger from any
                            source. The Consul was to explain to local authorities that further
                            violence against the Ngo family would harm the new regime's
                            international reputation. The Consul should also remind these
                            authorities that the United States took similar action to protect
                                <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Quang Tri</persName> from the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government. (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>In telegram 6 to Hue, November 3, the Department sent further
                            instructions that in the event assistance to Can endangered American

                            General <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri</persName> and request protection
                            and removal of Can. The Department also suggested that the Embassy in
                            Saigon consider Can's immediate evacuation. (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>During 4 November thousands of people visited area of Can residence which
                            still guarded by troops and armor and nearby Tunam Pagoda. Many
                            thousands also trekked three kilometers to large estate of Can south of
                            Hue which about half constructed. Estate, which included large
                            agricultural development and various buildings and landscapings,
                            thoroughly looted and destroyed by crowds. Former French ammo storage
                            buildings which converted to eighteenth century type dungeons with
                            filthy, tiny pitch black cells also on grounds. Latter observed by
                            reporting officer. These source of considerable agitation against Can
                            and family.</p>

                            report received that students at Quochoc High School attempted to turn

                            all caches of arms and agents of former regime should be reported, he
                            would form peoples committee to help him solve problems, people should
                            allow criminals of former regime to be punished by courts,
                            demonstrations by people would be allowed in a few days. Latter
                            presumably would be pro-coup.</p>

                                Minh</persName> and M Gen Timmes Minh expressed regret that it had
                            been necessary to resort to a coup, however, it had been apparent that
                            rectification of the situation by pacific means would not be possible.
                            Stated that daylight coup had been decided upon in belief that fewer
                            casualties would result. Nov 1st selected due that day a holiday and
                            children would not be in school which would also tend to minimize
                            casualties. He stated that Revolutionary Committee had not anticipated
                            overthrow of the govt would be particularly difficult but that major
                            concern was how <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> might react. Feels
                            that coup was carried out with such dispatch that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> did not have time to react and that now situation
                            permits troop availability to counter any <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> reaction which may now develop.</p>
                        <p>5. Best line-up on province chiefs as of now follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Fourteen (14) old prov chiefs have pledged their support to the coup
                            and retain their prov chief assignments.</p>
                        <p>b. Three (3) old province chiefs have been reported as retaining their

                            not intended or ordered by coup leaders. Coup carried out in remarkably
                            restrained and efficient manner indicating wisdom and sense of
                            responsibility on part of generals and also that coup overwhelmingly
                            supported by populace. We feel that generals committed to vigorous
                            prosecution of war and will re-energize struggle not only in military
                                <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0592"/>but in civilian aspects. In
                            sum we feel basis has been laid for an effort in Vietnam that gives far
                            greater hope for success than was case under <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government. We intend to support

                            brother they did not have any great regrets for the regime. The U.S. on
                            the other hand had continually supported <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> until the very end when he had lost our confidence.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> then gave his view
                            of the future of the present regime along typically <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> lines. He said the military
                            were in power, the military meant war, this would mean that they would
                            intensify their war efforts and would press us for increased assistance,
                            demands which we would find hard to resist. He saw very little hope in
                            the Indo-Chinese situation and attempted obliquely to place some blame
                            on the U.S. for coming into the south while China and Russia were coming
                            in from the north. I pointed out to the General however that we would
                            have been perfectly willing to live with a divided Vietnam but that the
                            Communists were the ones who had started the current war and that it was
                            either a question of helping Vietnam resist these attacks or letting the
                            entire country go Communist. I asked the General whether he thought a
                            divided Vietnam was worse than a divided Korea. He replied that the
                            division of Korea meant that there was no solution there, to which I
                            agreed but said that there was at least an accommodation that kept the
                            peace. He repeated his prophecy that the present government <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0595"/>would have to be more active in the war
                            and that this would eventually make it unpopular with the people as had
                            been the case with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I did not feel it wise to raise with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> our feeling that
                            the change in regime would end any question of neutralization. I did not
                            think this added anything to the discussion and he certainly gave me no
                            evidence of any interest in the question.</p>

                        <p>MAC JOO 8625. Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> called on me
                            this morning. This is the first time I've seen him since Adm <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>'s departure last Friday.<note n="2" xml:id="d298fn2">November 1.</note> We discussed the recent
                            past and future plans. I said I had heard so many conflicting stories on
                            the coup and on the demise of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> I
                            would like to get his version.</p>
                        <p>He said as far as he could tell, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> left
                            the Palace Friday evening about 2200. They went in some Chinese
                            civilian's car to a house in Cholon. Though the Generals had talked to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> during the evening, neither of the
                            brothers let on they were no longer in the Palace. <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> intelligence knew the house in Cholon
                            and the two were arrested there, Saturday, a.m.</p>
                        <p>They were placed in an M-133 for security and for delivery to the <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> compound. Upon arrival at the compound
                            it was discovered they were dead. The Generals were truly grievous over
                            this because they had promised safe conduct. Don did not explain what
                            had happened, whether it was suicide or someone had not got the
                            word.</p>
                        <p>He is holding the coffins for later shipment to Hue for burial.</p>
                        <p>I asked about <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Ngo Dinh Can</persName>, the
                            late President's brother in Hue. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said I Corps troops were protecting him and he was
                            considering bringing him to Saigon for safekeeping. I asked about the
                            graves <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0596"/>reported being found in
                            Can's enclave. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> smiled and
                            said they had nothing to do with Can at all. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> knows Can very well and, while I Corps Commander,
                            visited him many times. He said he knew where the graves were and that
                            they had been there for years. They belong to many families who lived in
                            and around the area even before it became Can's residence.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> went on to say he received a
                            call from Los Angeles from Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> this morning. That the Madame went into a tirade,
                            saying they were all fools-murderers and bought by the Americans-that
                            the people would never follow Big Minh or the military. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> disclaimed any connection with the
                            demise of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>-also that he was not bought off. He
                            told the Madame if she were here she would see for herself the changed
                            attitude of the people. She asked about her children. Don told her they
                            departed last night, but could not tell her when they would arrive in
                            Rome. Incidentally, they must be there by now as they made good
                            connections with a jet flight out of Bangkok last night.</p>
                        <p>As to the present—they were still making changes in command—also in some
                            province chiefs (I'll report them when firm). I reminded him many of the
                            province chiefs had done well and suggested not changing them all just
                            for change's sake.</p>
                        <p>He admitted he and <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName>
                            considered the possibility of a counter coup—but are not too concerned
                            as they pretty well know who is involved.</p>
                        <p>I asked about Col Tung, former Commander of the Spec Forces. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> was with the Generals when the coup started. He
                            said he didn't know what has happened to him since.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> feels he can get most of the
                            troops out of the city by this weekend and as soon as the changes in
                            command are established, he will be ready to prosecute the war. He said
                            he as Minister of Defense and Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> could see no difficulties in getting orders carried
                            out.</p>
                        <p>The Special Forces now under command of Maj Gen Nghiem, former Commander
                            of III and I Corps and who now also commands the parachute brigade, will
                            be directly under the command of the <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss>. Further, when working in a corps of S.F.'s would be under
                            command of the corps commander concerned.</p>
                        <p>He intends to disarm the Republican Youth except those who are hamlet
                            militia, and also Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s
                            Women's Army. He hopes to steer them to more productive fields—didn't
                            explain the productive part.</p>
                        <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0597"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said Gen <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>, presently III Corps Commander,
                            would probably be Minister of Security. Wearing this hat he would
                            command the National Police and perhaps the Gendarmerie. However, he was
                            considering bringing the Gendarmerie back into the army as most of the
                            officers and <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>'s originally came from
                            the army.</p>
                        <p>All in all, if, I repeat, if things work out, we'll have a more orderly
                            set-up-and a more streamlined chain of command, fewer para-military
                            organizations under arms and not as much concern with political
                            interference which caused delays and in some cases changed missions and
                            orders.</p>
                        <p>I reminded <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> that the courage
                            and determination shown by the coup's battalions in overcoming the
                            Presidential Brigade of 1,500 men, if displayed in fighting a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> battalion of three to four hundred men,
                            could make short order of the remaining <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>All this might add up to a much earlier ETA for getting counterinsurgency
                            in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> under control.</p>
                        <p>I feel sure this will be true if I can get the show on the road.</p>
                        <p>Regards. </p>

                            Special Forces. I note ref C reports decision has been made to maintain
                            the Special Forces but to delimit their functions and to subordinate
                            command to the <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> and corps
                            commanders.</p>
                        <p>B. During same conversation with Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, proficiency of Gen Cao was discussed and I got
                            definite impression that a change would be made in order to give better
                            leadership to the accelerated military effort to be undertaken in IV
                            Corps. Ref D reports that Gen Cao has been relieved by B Gen Nhon.</p>
                        <p>C. It important, of course, for combat units brought into Saigon during
                            coup to be returned to their field duties at [of] fighting the war. My
                            staff estimates that there is an equivalent of one and one-half
                            divisions in Saigon area not counting troops from Quang Trung training
                            center and Thu Duc. Ref C reports no significant change in Saigon troop
                            disposition since the coup and that situation should start to improve by
                            the coming weekend.</p>
                        <p>D. <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> had been operating under
                            restrictions as to armament load. Ref C reports restrictions have been
                            lifted.</p>
                        <p>E. We hope to see soon increased tempo of operations in the field and
                            implementation of intent as stated orally by the gens.</p>
                        <p>F. It particularly important to obtain whole-hearted support of civilian
                            leaders and institutions.</p>
                        <p>G. Under <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime,
                            restrictions were placed against military psyops directed toward
                            population in support of civic action program. We can expect these
                            restrictions to be lifted.</p>
                        <p>H. It encouraging to note that police in Saigon are back on the job.</p>
                        <p>I. Ref D gives preliminary report on province chiefs. I would expect new
                            arrangement to destroy parallel system established by <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> whereby province chiefs could
                            switch hats and bypass the corps commanders and the <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>J. I think it important to determine the future of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s Republican Youth
                            Organization.</p>
                        <p>K. We can assume that Nhu had an organization which was penetrating the
                            military. Counter-coup planning would emanate from these infiltrators.
                            They should be weeded out. </p>

                        <p>On November 5, 1963, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, accompanied by Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Roger Hilsman</persName>, testified in secret
                            executive session before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the
                            situation in Vietnam. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in his testimony set the background of the
                            situation in Saigon in the weeks preceding the coup, minimized U.S.
                            involvement with coup planners, and expressed the Department of State's
                            fear that the coup would result in a prolonged civil war. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reviewed <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s efforts to assure <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s safety during the coup, and
                            described <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s escape to Cholon, their
                            surrender and capture, and their deaths. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> opined that the Generals did not order the
                            assassination, which “was done by trigger-happy people down the line.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> explained that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> children had been
                            evacuated to Rome and that Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was traveling to meet them there.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was optimistic about the
                            prospects for the new government in South Vietnam which he thought would
                            be predominantly civilian. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            concluded his testimony by reviewing abortive coups and “endemic” rumors
                            of coups since 1960. These, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            stated, had made him skeptical about rumors of the November 1 coup.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then answered extensive
                            questions from members of the Committee. The 39-page transcript of the

                            necessity to keep a weather eye out for the counter-insurgency effort.
                            While <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> initiated activity diminished,
                            it did not come to a halt. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity,
                            on the other hand, remained fairly constant. On balance, while the VN
                            cannot be credited with gaining, they lost no ground”.</p>
                        <p>Question 2: Is the government responding to our threefold need for
                            improvement in (a) campaign against the Viet Cong; (b) internal
                            developments and (c) actions affecting relations between American people
                            and government?</p>
                        <p>Answer: On (a) General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>
                            intends—and I expect—a stepped-up campaign against the Viet Cong.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> is also
                            optimistic about this.</p>
                        <p>Under (b) it is obvious that there have been revolutionary internal
                            political developments.</p>
                        <p>Under (c) the whole trend of the new crowd is to have warm and cordial
                            relations with the American people and government. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> says: “We have found the
                            attitudes of the Vietnamese in their relations with their American
                            advisers to be extremely cordial and open.”</p>
                        <p>Question 3: What does the evidence suggest on the strengthening or
                            weakening of effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in
                            relation to its own people?</p>
                        <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0602"/>
                        <p>Answer: Evidence suggests much strengthening of the relationship of the
                            new government with its own people.</p>
                        <p>It is evident even to a foreigner who does not speak Vietnamese that the
                            coup is very popular. People cheer the American flag; they are free to
                            express their loathing of the “family” and the pagodas are full of
                            smiling people.</p>
                        <p>Crowds gather in front of newspaper offices waiting for papers. Although
                            newspapers understandably do not yet show much individuality of
                            editorial opinion, they already reflect variety in coverage of important
                            news stories. Perhaps local reporters no longer simply accepting Vietnam
                            Press and Information Directorate handouts but going out seeking
                            news.</p>
                        <p>Question 4: And more specifically what effect are we getting from our own
                            actions under <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 534<note n="3" xml:id="d302fn3">
                                <ref target="#d181">Document 181</ref>.</note> and what
                            modifications in either direction do you think advisable?</p>
                        <p>Answer: Now that we have a few days' perspective since the coup, we can
                            say that we got a great effect from our actions under <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 534.</p>
                        <p>1. At the time of the pagoda raids of August 21, U.S.G. and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> seemed to be totally deadlocked.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> evidently thought that the US was
                            hooked; it seemed that we were on the horns of a dilemma in which we
                            were forced either to do nothing or else to injure the war effort and
                            dangerously lower the basic living standard of the people-or else to act
                            like a colonial power. There seemed to be nothing which would hurt
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> which would not hurt us as much, if
                            not more. We were being totally taken for granted by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>; we were never asked to do even the
                            smallest favor.</p>
                        <p>2. We began to show our displeasure. Responding to the President's
                            declaration in Washington, I adopted a policy of silence and of simple
                            correctness in relations with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. In
                            this period I privately gave advice to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            which, had they followed it, would have resulted in their being alive
                            today. Then there were these facts: our failure to provide any US planes
                            or naval vessels, as was customary, for the October 26 National Day
                            ceremonies; the Voice of America broadcasts on the dignity of man and
                            human freedom; and, particularly the evident indignation caused to
                            Americans by Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>'s
                            statement regarding US junior officers,<note n="4" xml:id="d302fn4">See
                                    <ref target="#d158fn3">footnote 3. Document 158</ref>.</note>
                            which impressed Vietnamese. Our evident determination to give asylum to
                                <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> was much noticed.
                            Also, we did not, as we had done in the past, turn over coup information
                            to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0603"/>
                        <p>3. When the effect of the withholding of commercial import payments,
                            coupled with the withholding of payments to Colonel <persName corresp="#p_TUNG1">Tung</persName> started to be felt, cracks began
                            to appear in the blank wall, and it was evident that we were getting
                            some room for maneuver. There was a loosening up of the masonry and
                            signs that we were no longer being taken completely for granted.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s message to me through
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s own questions to me Sunday,
                            October 27 at Dalat and on last Friday morning, all may have marked a
                            new attitude on his part, or the beginnings of one. Vice President Tho's
                            evident approval of what we were doing and [<hi rend="italic">less than
                                1 1ine not declassified</hi>] evident last minute desire to get on
                            the right side of the US were noteworthy straws in the wind. We really
                            seemed to be getting some leverage.</p>
                        <p>4. There is no doubt that the coup was a Vietnamese and a popular affair,
                            which we could neither manage nor stop after it got started and which we
                            could only have influenced with great difficulty. But it is equally
                            certain that the ground in which the coup seed grew into a robust plant
                            was prepared by us and that the coup would not have happened with [when]
                            it did without our preparation. General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> as much as said this to me on November 3. Our
                            actions made the people who could do something about it start thinking
                            hard about how to get a change of government.</p>
                        <p>5. Another indication of this was the statement made on the radio by
                            Vietnamese speakers on the day of the coup that the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> regime had deprived the country of US aid without
                            which the Communists would gain and that the Army's coup would enable
                            the country to get this economic aid and thus survive. This was not in
                            any proclamations put out officially by the Generals' committee, but it
                            was widely said by nameless “authorized spokesmen”. Ex-Minister of
                            Health De has also emphasized importance our action on aid.</p>
                        <p>6. All this may be a useful lesson in the use of US power for those who
                            face similar situation in other places in the future. The President, the
                            State Department, the military, the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>,
                            the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, and the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> deserve credit for this result. Without
                            united action by the US Government, it would not have been possible.
                            Many Americans in Saigon were required suddenly to start thinking
                            differently, a difficult thing to do. The fact that they did so is
                            creditable.</p>
                        <p>7. Perhaps the US Government has here evolved a way of not being
                            everywhere saddled with responsibility for autocratic governments simply
                            because they are anti-Communist-a course which can eventually lead many
                            people to believe that the foreign Communist autocracy which they don't
                            know is preferable to the local autocracy which they do know. Nothing
                            could put the cause of freedom into a stronger position than for those
                            on the side of freedom to be able to clean their own house and not be so
                            often in a situation in which we have to put up with autocrats at the
                            very worst or at the best with <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0604"/>Colonel Blimps in order to avoid being taken over by Communism. The
                            ingenuity which was shown in working out a way to put pressure on
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> without endangering the war effort,
                            and without lowering the basic living standard of the people made a most
                            valuable contribution. Clearly the coup has brought about a change; let
                            us hope it will turn out to be a great improvement.</p>
                        <p>8. In a country like this, exhortations, argument, rhetoric, and facial
                            expressions mean very little. Actions apparently are an international
                            language. But they must not be “colonial” actions, only the kind of
                            pressure which partners can put on each other. Our actions were not
                            “colonial” and when Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            accused me of acting like the Governor General of Indochina, it did not
                            ring true.</p>
                        <p>9. The prospects now are for a shorter war, thanks to the fact that there
                            is this new government, provided the Generals stay together. Certainly
                            officers and soldiers who can pull off an operation like this should be
                            able to do very well on the battlefield if their hearts are as much in
                            it.</p>
                        <p>10. My thanks to you and all those associated with you for comprehending
                            [comprehensive] and imaginative guidance and support.</p>

                        <p>Regarding 1) above, no political figures appear in government and all

                            experience in their fields. Some of them are considered by Mission
                            personnel to be competent, honest public servants, but at least two

                            types. Quang (Rural Affairs), Lam (Foreign Affairs) and Giang (Labor)
                            stand out as the best civilian appointments. Giang <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0605"/>maintains excellent relations with

                            and Buddhists.</p>
                        <p>Regarding 2) above, Revolutionary Military Council holds legislative and
                            executive powers “pending amendment of constitution” and President of
                            Council, “Big” <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> is Chief of

                            registered by Vietnamese, primarily by those with histories of political
                            activity and, presumably, political ambitions. While Embassy sampling
                            still small, such complaints center on fact government 1) non-political
                            and technical; 2) allegedly lacks vision and drive to solve Vietnam's
                            problems; and, therefore, 3) cannot long maintain support of people.
                            Additional complaints heard: 1) large percentage members of government
                            pro-French, and 2) various elements in Vietnamese political life not
                            represented.</p>
                        <p>Countering above criticism, based on all available samplings by Embassy,

                            this particular process of continuous watching on a specific set of
                            questions.</p>
                        <p>Your own leadership in pulling together and directing the whole American
                            operation in South Vietnam in recent months has been of the greatest
                            importance, and you should know that this achievement is recognized here
                            throughout the Government.</p>
                        <p>Now that there is a new Government which we are about to recognize, we
                            must all intensify our efforts to help it deal with its many hard
                            problems. As you say, while this was a Vietnamese effort, our own
                            actions made it clear that we wanted improvements, and when these were
                            not forthcoming from the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            Government, we necessarily faced and accepted the possibility that our
                            position might encourage a change of government. We thus have a
                            responsibility to help this new government to be effective in every way
                            that we can, and in these first weeks we may have more influence and
                            more chance to be helpful than at any time in recent years.</p>
                        <p>I am particularly concerned myself that our primary emphasis should be on
                            effectiveness rather than upon external appearances. If the new
                            Government can limit confusion and intrigue among its members, and
                            concentrate its energies upon the real problems of winning the contest
                            against the Communists and holding the confidence of its own people, it
                            will have met and passed a severe test. This is what we must help in,
                            just at it was ineffectiveness, loss of popular confidence, and the
                            prospect of defeat that were decisive in shaping our relations to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that much good will come from the comprehensive review of the
                            situation which is now planned for Honolulu,<note n="4" xml:id="d304fn4">November 19-20; see <ref target="#d321">Document 321</ref>.</note>

                            as I remember, that our only interest was to help South Vietnam defend
                            itself against subversive aggression from the north. He then said that
                            if Hanoi would cease its aggressive interference in South Vietnam the
                            need for our advisory presence would disappear and we would
                                withdraw.<note n="4" xml:id="d305fn4">Apparent reference to a

                        <p>It seems to me that these two thoughts might be reiterated by <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> in Saigon in connection with an
                            announcement about our resumption of aid. Alternatively the President
                            could say something like this at his next press conference,<note n="6" xml:id="d305fn6">At his press conference of November 14, the
                                President stated, in response to a question, that the U.S. objective
                                in South Vietnam was “to bring Americans home, permit the Vietnamese
                                to maintain themselves as a free and independent country, and permit
                                democratic forces within the country to operate-which they can, of
                                course, much more freely when the assault from the inside, which is
                                manipulated from the north, is ended.” For the transcript of the

                            sometimes unreliable, and omit other factors that are important but
                            cannot be quantified. However, the statistics selected are among those
                            regularly highlighted by the Military Assistance Command (MAC) and
                                <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss> in its weekly briefings <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0609"/>of State's Vietnam Working
                            Group. We recall that Generals Krulak and Wheeler, during last spring's

                            emphasis in the estimate.</p>
                        <p>While it is true that the data in our report cover largely a period of
                            only seven weeks (actually, three sets of figures extend over nineteen
                            weeks), it should be noted that <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            and joint US mission reports from Saigon on trends and developments in
                            the counterinsurgency program, including statistical compilations, often
                            examine much shorter periods.</p>
                        <p>We naturally agree that military assessments are basically the
                            responsibility of the Department of Defense. However, the unique and
                            varied political factors involved in the insurgency in South Vietnam and
                            the continuing political crisis since May led us to investigate the
                            possibility that the counterinsurgency effort may have been adversely
                            affected during this period. Indeed, over the past few years we have
                            similarly made intermittent political-military assessments of progress
                            and problems in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>We would like to comment briefly on two assertions in the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff memorandum. It claims as a favorable indicator “the rise of
                            confidence and fighting efficiency of the Vietnamese military forces.”
                            (Page 2) We agree that these qualities have improved generally over the
                            past few years but we believe that morale nonetheless has been adversely
                            affected in recent months. The US Military Attache in Saigon reported
                            last month that the Vietnamese Deputy Commander of Corps III feared mass
                            desertions among his troops, possibly as high as 80%.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> memorandum also claims that the
                            armed strength of the Viet Cong has decreased. While it is true that the
                            present estimate (October 1963) of Viet Cong strength, as reported by
                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>, is lower than the previous
                            estimate of last March, it should be noted that <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> has changed the criteria for determining the Viet Cong
                            order of battle. In its October report, <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> states:</p>
                        <p>“In previous editions of the <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> Viet
                            Cong OB, an arbitrary figure of 100 personnel per company and 30 per
                            platoon was assigned in those cases where hard evidence was lacking upon
                            which to base a strength computation. Commencing with this edition, all
                            strength estimates have been based on evidence obtained from
                            prisoner-of-war estimates or from captured documents.”</p>
                        <p>Thus there is no basis for comparing the most recent estimate with those
                            of six months and one year ago.</p>

                            <item>Department of State Bureau of Intelligence and Research Estimate
                                of Military Situation in South Vietnam</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. The Department of State Bureau of Intelligence and Research has
                            published and distributed a memorandum (Tab B) which concludes that, as
                            of 22 October, the military situation in Vietnam may have reverted to
                            the condition of six months to one year previous. This conclusion
                            respecting the military aspect of the Vietnam war is derived from an
                            evaluation of four statistical factors: casualties, weapons losses,
                            defectors and Viet Cong incidents covering an eleven-week period from 1
                            July to 18 September 1963. In short, the paper makes a broad military
                            judgement of a complex combat situation, derived from a survey of a
                            limited number of factors in a limited period of time.</p>
                        <p>2. In confining itself to the four indices mentioned, the memorandum does
                            not take into account fundamental military considerations which should
                            weigh heavily in any appraisal of the progress of the campaign. These
                            include such factors as:</p>
                        <p>a. Growth in the character and intensity of the Vietnamese offensive
                            effort—air, sea and ground—over the past year.</p>
                        <p>b. Degree of pacification achieved in the plateau and coastal prams.</p>
                        <p>c. Strategic and tactical implications of the shift in Vietnamese
                            offensive effort to the Viet Cong stronghold in the Delta.</p>
                        <p>d. Nature of the Viet Cong tactical reaction as they are compressed into
                            a progressively smaller area.</p>
                        <p>3. The conclusion that a major military retrogression has occurred
                            ignores various substantial indices of military progress which
                            include:</p>
                        <p>a. The rise in confidence and fighting efficiency of the Vietnamese
                            military forces.</p>
                        <p>b. Increases in freedom of movement and increased use of the roads and
                            rail lines, particularly in the north and central regions. (The
                            memorandum would lead one to believe that the freedom of movement had
                            decreased.)</p>
                        <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0611"/>
                        <p>c. The number of people resettled in strategic hamlets (population now in
                            hamlets—9.7 million; 6 months ago-about 6 million; 12 months ago-less
                            than 2 million).</p>
                        <p>d. The number of strategic hamlets organized, built and equipped (number
                            of completed hamlets now—over 8,300; 6 months ago—6,000; 12 months
                            ago—3,000).</p>
                        <p>e. Number of village and hamlet radios installed and in use, bringing a
                            new level of security to rural regions (5,200 radios now installed; six
                            months ago—2,500; 12 months ago—1,300).</p>
                        <p>f. The steady diminution in the strength of Viet Cong forces (present
                            estimate-about 93,000; estimate six months ago—114,000; estimate 12
                            months ago—123,000).</p>
                        <p>g. The numbers of paramilitary forces trained and equipped (total to
                            date—188,000; six months ago—151,000; 12 months ago—53,000).</p>
                        <p>4. Apart from the above omissions, the following points in the memorandum
                            also warrant attention:</p>
                        <p>a. The paper projects unfavorable end-1963 values for three of the four
                            statistical factors, based upon an extrapolation of the selected
                            eleven-week period to the end of the year. Extrapolation of a limited
                            sample must be heavily discounted, since graphic representation of those
                            military factors considered in the paper plot irregularly over any short
                            period of time. Trends, and trends only, may be detected—through the
                            general upward or downward direction of the over-all trace—while
                            extension of any rising or descending period can produce deceptive
                            results. Indeed, in the 6 weeks following the cut-off date of the State
                            evaluation, the number of Viet Cong attacks, for example, decreased by
                            about 40%. Using the same extrapolative method of estimate employed in
                            the State paper would result in the unlikely conclusion that, by
                            end—1963, there would be no Viet Cong attacks whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>b. The paper points out that the “Chieu Hoi” Amnesty Program rates have
                            decreased from 3,200 per month to about 1,600 per month, and uses this
                            as part of the basis for its conclusions regarding a military
                            retrogression. The paper fails, however, to take note of the more
                            important fact that twelve months ago there was no Chieu <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Hoi</persName> Program at all, and that surrenders
                            were rare. To date the program has already collected about 14,000
                            persons. When the effort was initiated in the Spring of 1963 a large
                            wave of persons came over to the Vietnamese side. The monthly rate has
                            since decreased from the high initial figure, but is continuing to bring
                            in substantial numbers daily. The reservoir of potential returnees, of
                            course, is also diminishing, since 9-1/2 million of the 12 million rural
                            residents are already in strategic hamlets.</p>
                        <p>5. It is the judgment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, based on an appraisal
                            of all of the relevant factors up to 1 November, that the military
                            situation should be appraised as follows—As of that date the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> offensive effort has not achieved the
                            optimum levels envisaged in the National Campaign Plan, but is on the
                            way thereto. Meanwhile, the Viet Cong have been reacting sharply to the
                            intensification of <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0612"/>operations
                            in the Delta area. Coup plotting in Saigon, as well as genuine doubt
                            regarding US intentions deriving from our economic sanctions against the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, have operated against a more
                            vigorous prosecution of the campaign. Overall, the military campaign is
                            still progressing favorably and clearly has not been “set back to the
                            point it occupied six months ago.” </p>
                        <p>6. About 40 copies of the State Department document have already been
                            distributed to the White House, to various offices of <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>,
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the Departments of State and
                            Defense, and a request has already been received, at the action officer
                            level, for Joint Chiefs of Staff concurrence in release of the document
                            to Senator Hickenlooper and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
                            While the study has little importance in itself, the diffusion of its
                            inaccurate military conclusions could have unfavorable effects, since it
                            contradicts publicly announced Department of Defense estimates on these
                            military matters.</p>
                        <p>7. Accordingly, it is recommended that the matter be brought to the
                            attention of the Secretary of State, either orally or in the form of a
                            memorandum, as attached hereto.</p>

                        <p>2. He expressed his great appreciation that the U.S. had been so prompt
                            in extending recognition to the new Government of Viet-Nam. Out of our

                        <p>3. The government was going to step up the war effort in the military
                            sense and also as regards a program of social justice. He stressed
                            particularly lessening the burden of forced labor out in the countryside
                            which had been much too heavy during the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime; and consolidating and improving the

                            fulfill all of the needs of the true community, and because, in all too
                            many cases, the individual did not think the hamlets increased his

                        <p>4. Although I brought up the matter of exorbitant taxes and land
                            ownership, he appeared to think they were not as important as the ones
                            that he mentioned.</p>
                        <p>5. When he asked me my advice, I said I hoped that General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> would be able to spend a few
                            minutes from time to time in making the public feel that he had a warm
                            approach to the public. This warmth had been very much lacking in the
                            previous administration. I thought that if he would arrange to visit
                            some of the pagodas, if only for twenty minutes, and shake hands and
                            sign some autographs, it would fill a need which all people feel,
                            regardless of race or geography, of being courted by political leaders.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> had great prestige
                            and was a personable man, and I felt sure this would do a lot of good
                            and would cost nothing. I also hoped that he would arrange to drop in in
                            a helicopter on various units in the field, asking a few questions and
                            then leave, and that this would also have a good result.</p>
                        <p>6. When he pressed me for more advice, I said that it was vitally
                            important, now that the Buddhists were in the big majority in the
                            government, to avoid any action which could possibly, by any stretch of
                            the imagination, appear to be anti-Christian. Anything like this could
                            be utterly disastrous to world opinion regarding Viet-Nam. He agreed
                            emphatically.</p>
                        <p>7. I also thought they could do a much better job on press relations than
                            had been done by the previous administration, and I made a few
                            elementary suggestions on that subject.</p>
                        <p>8. I hoped <persName>Ngo Dinh</persName> Can would be treated with
                            leniency. Lam seemed to think this would be the case and that he was
                            really now in protective custody. I said if he were assassinated, it
                            would be unspeakable and offered to fly him out of the country if <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> desired.</p>
                        <p>9. When I asked him whom I should call on, he said that as I had called
                            on General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, and General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>, I had really done enough. But then
                            he reflected and said, although protocol does not call for it, he would
                            be personally very happy if I were to call on General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>, and impress upon him the great
                            importance of not having any police state methods of government, in
                            particular, the most unfortunate practice which prevailed in the
                            previous regime, of taking young girls out of the house in the middle of
                            the night and off to some concentration camp. He was glad to see that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> had made a
                            declaration along these lines. He said that the “top” was all right, but
                            the thing was to get the order carried out in the lower levels. He did
                            not seem to think I needed to call on anybody else.</p>
                        <p>10. He said he had only accepted his crushing post which was so much
                            beyond his powers because of his belief that he could count on U.S.
                            help. I assured him that he could.</p>

                            planned to open full-fledged Embassy there, but <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s latest action had shelved

                        <p>977. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>. Foreign Minister Lam (protect
                            source) asked Political Counselor to meet with him yesterday afternoon
                            for informal talk. Emphasizing that he speaking on strictly personal
                            basis, Lam inquired re public reactions to coup in U.S. After fill-in
                            from press summaries, Lam remarked that U.S. could not avoid charge of
                            having backed or supported coup regardless of outcome. He noted two
                            contradictory rumors in Saigon that U.S. backed coup primarily because
                            (1) U.S. convinced <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had
                            contacts and dealing with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> for
                            neutral solution Vietnamese problem; and (2) U.S. desired change of
                            regime in order obtain new group more amenable neutral solution. Latter
                            rumor obviously naive but indicative of current confused attitudes. Lam
                            expressed strong hope for early U.S. recognition to clear air and help
                            legitimatize provisional government, although noting Foreign Minister
                            formal request for recognition only circulated on Wednesday.<note n="2" xml:id="d308fn2">November 6.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Lam then turned to current problems of new government and appealed for
                            continued U.S. advice and support in days ahead. He noted that
                            relationship between Military Revolutionary Committee and executive
                            headed by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> not
                            clearly spelled out and Ministers still feeling their way. However, he
                            believed relationship likely evolve in such manner that executive would
                            run day-to-day affairs of government but with close consultation with
                            military committee on broad policies.</p>
                        <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0615"/>
                        <p>Lam expressed deep concern over possible dangers in organization of
                            police under new government. He felt appointment of General <persName corresp="#p_XUAN1">Xuan</persName> as head of National Police placed
                            ex-Surete type in key position where he could carry out program of
                            arrests, intimidations and reprisals reminiscent of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. This coupled with appointment of
                            headstrong, impetuous General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> as Minister of Security created situation which
                            would bear close watching. Lam labeled reorganization of police and
                            their reorientation to protection of civil liberties as “number one
                            problem of provisional government.” Similarly there was need to assure
                            populace of impartial administration of justice both in cities and
                            countryside.</p>
                        <p>With regard to general approach and image of new executive, Lam
                            considered it essential that there be rather sharp contrast between its
                            approach to populace and that of previous regime. For example, new
                            administration should shed itself of trappings of obvious security
                            measures for movements of Prime Minister and should emphasize simplicity
                            and desire to keep in touch with the people. Bureaucracy should be
                            instructed that advancement dependent on performance alone and that
                            employees should concentrate on discharging their responsibilities and
                            eschew petty politics. Lam said he had discussed above with <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>, who was in a like mind.</p>
                        <p>Lam had no idea how long transition period between provisional and
                            elected government would be, but believed in principle it should be as
                            short as possible consistent with successful prosecution of the war. In
                            this connection he inquired as to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            reaction in the countryside, which EmbOff provided based on latest
                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> reporting.</p>
                        <p>Lam expressed some concern over French attitudes and policy in present
                            circumstances and for future. He asked to be informed if we received any
                            information as to when (or in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Lalouette</persName> would return to Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Lam said there would be some reshuffling of functions at FonMin. With
                            regard to post of Secretary General, he said he was considering list of
                            candidates among whom mutual friend appeared prominently (probably Lien,
                            former Counselor of Embassy in Washington).</p>
                        <p>Lam noted that Ambassador Ly was being recalled for consultation and that
                            despite previous indications that he would return to Vietnam, nothing
                            had been heard from former Ambassador Chuong. He added that if we had
                            suggestions as to likely candidates for Ambassador to Washington he
                            would welcome them on personal basis.</p>
                        <p>In closing, Lam reemphasized personal nature his remarks and his hope
                            U.S. Government would soon grant recognition to the new provisional
                            government.</p>

                        <p>991. During a conversation at a social function, General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> made the following points:</p>
                        <p>1. That the exorbitant amount of forced labor which had been required of
                            people in the Strategic Hamlets in order to construct the Strategic
                            Hamlets had been and was being drastically reduced. The previous regime,
                            he said, had gone about the Strategic Hamlet program in the wrong way,
                            even though the idea itself is excellent.</p>
                        <p>2. He was pleased with my congratulations on the statement deploring
                            arbitrary arrests and was determined to adhere to it.</p>
                        <p>3. He was well aware of the unspeakable results which would flow from any
                            kind of anti-Christian attitude and was determined that such a thing
                            would not happen.</p>
                        <p>4. When I asked whether General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> was going to meet the people and do some
                            handshaking and give some autographs, he said that as a military man,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> did not like doing
                            that kind of thing, even though he, Don, realized it was important.</p>
                        <p>5. Like labor leader Tran Quoc Buu, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> felt particularly strong about the elimination of
                            the “caiz”—the Chinese racketeers and extortionists who get between the
                            laboring man and the employer and extort very substantial sums of money.
                            He said that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> at the
                            beginning of his rule was very vigorous about the Chinese community and
                            enunciated absolutely correct policies, but that eventually the Chinese

                        <p>We believe that these suggestions by highly reputable journalists may
                            cause suspicions and questions to arise on the part of the new <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> about U.S. policy and intentions.
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Foreign Minister Lam has told
                            the Embassy that a rumor is already circulating in Saigon that the U.S.
                            supported the change in regime in Vietnam to obtain a new group more
                            amenable to a neutral situation.<note n="4" xml:id="d311fn4">See <ref target="#d308">Document 308</ref>.</note>

                            neutralization of South Vietnam, should be allayed by the Secretary's

                            leaves the picture blurred by suggesting that U.S. policy be carried

                                    <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName> stated the
                                military junta considered <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> “a symbol of the old order.” They resented
                                his earlier assessments that the Buddhist crisis and the politics of
                                the Ngo family were not adversely affecting the war effort and did
                                not trust him with their coup plans. Conversely, <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName> claimed <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s position among the
                                Generals had risen since the coup. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName> reported policy differences between
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> over support of the Ngos,
                                claimed <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> was taken
                                unaware by the coup, and cited “Embassy members” as saying that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> had dominated
                                former Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>.</note> Both <persName>Bundy</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> thought it was very
                            unfortunate. When Dungan jokingly asked <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> if he didn't like to overthrow established
                            order, <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> replied that he
                            did not like to do it in public, and added that certainly no one wanted
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName> driving General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> around Saigon in an

                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName> would be leaving
                            Saigon soon for another post.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to the forthcoming Honolulu meeting.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> remarked that the agenda seemed to be
                            full of briefings and asked <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> if something could be done about that or
                            whether they would have to have some dinners on the side to do some real
                            talking.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> replied that the only
                            way to break it up was to do as <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> did, which was to interrupt loudly in the
                            middle of any mechanical briefing. From this exchange, it became clear
                            that at least <persName>Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> now plan to do most of their work outside the
                            meetings. When someone asked <persName>Bundy</persName> why he was
                            going, he replied that he had been instructed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> is going out early to
                            see Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> before the
                            meeting starts. <persName>Bundy</persName> thought this was a fine step,
                            and remarked that if we could just get the ax-Eisenhower Administration
                            people together, everything would be fine.</p>

                        <p>I had a brief talk with Bob Kleiman of the New York Times editorial board
                            this morning. I told him that I thought the <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName> article in this morning's edition was
                            irresponsible and mostly reflected a personal animus against General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> instead of accurate
                            news reporting.<note n="2" xml:id="d313fn2">See <ref target="#d313fn2">footnote 2</ref>, <ref target="#d312">Document
                                312</ref>.</note> Kleiman admitted that this might be so, but
                            pointed out that there must have been some differences of opinion
                            between the Embassy and <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>, since
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName> quoted inconsistent
                            Embassy sources and <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> public
                            statements.</p>
                        <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0621"/>
                        <p>Kleiman suggested rather strongly that we move as soon as possible toward
                            a reconvening of the Geneva Conference and a negotiated settlement of
                            the differences between North and South Vietnam. He argued that the
                            political strength of the South will never be as strong again as it will
                            be during the next few months, and that we should seize this opportunity
                            for negotiations before the situation deteriorated and we found
                            ourselves back in a 10-year, Malayan-type effort. In connection with
                            such negotiations he raised the possibility of effecting a mass
                            population transfer in an effort to get all of the Viet Cong moved from
                            the South back up to the North.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I had great difficulty with this suggestion and thought
                            that it would be folly to pursue this line at the present time. South
                            Vietnam was still not strong enough to approach the bargaining table
                            with any hope of coming away whole. Furthermore, there was no indication
                            that responsible Vietnamese in Vietnam would view the prospects of a new
                            Geneva Conference as anything less than a complete sellout by the U.S. I
                            emphasized that we definitely looked toward the time when South Vietnam
                            would be strong enough to deal with the North on at least a basis of
                            equality. I referred to the President's statement of last year and the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> statement of last month,<note n="3" xml:id="d313fn3">
                                <ref target="#d170">Document 170</ref>.</note> indicating that the
                            U.S. was prepared to withdraw its presence from South Vietnam as soon as
                            Hanoi ceased its interference in the South or as soon as the South was
                            able to handle the problem on its own. We had not yet reached that
                            point, however. I also questioned whether a population transfer would be
                            feasible in view of the difficulty of identifying the bulk of the Viet
                            Cong, to say nothing of the political problems involved in a forced
                            emigration.</p>
                        <p>Kleiman will no doubt continue to peddle his Geneva Conference idea, and
                            we should be preparing ourselves to counter it.</p>

                        <p>1. The Prime Minister said that he had been told by people in the
                            Government who had worked in the Strategic Hamlet Program before and by
                            the Generals that I was the American to see about the Strategic Hamlets.
                            He said he wanted my frank views and he would give me his. If there was
                            one thing he reproached in the Americans, he said, it was that they were
                            too diplomatic, they seemed unable to say what they meant. Only by a
                            frank exchange of views could we work together successfully, he
                            said.</p>
                        <p>2. The Prime Minister then began reminiscing about the days of the Binh
                            Xuyen, Hoa Hao and Cao Dai and how he, Col. <persName corresp="#p_LMGEG1">Lansdale</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> had worked together for President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> on these problems. He
                            said that afterwards he had remained the President's chief advisor until
                            1959 when he was pushed aside by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. He had tried to tell the President that his
                            policies were losing the support of the population in the south but the
                            President only called him and <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> “defeatists” and pushed them further aside.</p>
                        <p>3. He said it was difficult for the Americans to understand what had
                            happened in the Delta and how the support of the population had been
                            lost there but they must understand this now. The truth was that the
                            Government had been losing the war against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in the Delta for some time because it had been losing
                            the population. If one wanted to cite statistics, he said, all one
                            needed to do was mention the fact that the total number of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in the area was greater now than two
                            years ago, yet around 20,000 had supposedly been killed during this same
                            period. But beyond that, he said, he knew first hand what had been
                            happening because he personally knew the people of this region, his
                            region, and they had told him clearly over the past two years why more
                            and more people were fuming to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. He said that his home province of An Giang was an example. The
                            Government through forced labor (as much as 100 days per person) had
                            built the hamlets and many other public works (roads and canals). This
                            cost most people the equivalent of at least 1000 piastres either in cash
                            to pay for substitute labor or in losses suffered because they could not
                            perform other work. At the same time the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> only collected 50 to 100 piastres in taxes. Naturally
                            the people supported the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>—why would
                            they support a Government which was worse than the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Many people had come to him, he said,
                            and had broken <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0623"/>down in tears
                            over the situation. When <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>
                            would report this to the President, he would be shown long lists of
                            signatures on supposed petitions from people who had “volunteered” their
                            labor. Tho told him that these were fake documents specially prepared by
                            the Province Chief. The President would then talk about his trips to the
                            province and how he was always welcomed by the population. When
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> would try to tell him
                            that it was nothing but a “mise en scene,” he would not listen, and
                            would repeat that <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> was a
                            “defeatist.”</p>
                        <p>5. Not only did these practices alienate the people, <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> said, but the previous policy of
                            divide and rule employed against the major religious groups (the Hoa
                            Hao, the Cao Dai and the Catholics), as well as against the Khmer ethnic
                            minority, was disastrous. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>
                            and he, <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> said, had begged the
                            President to allow them to arm them, particularly the Hoa Hao, because
                            they were so firmly anti-communist. The President had been on the point
                            of agreeing, Tho said, when <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            persuaded him that he could not trust us (<persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>) or
                            the Hoa Hao. The Hoa Hao became discouraged because they were not helped
                            and because when they identified a communist in their midst and turned
                            him over to the provincial authorities he would bribe the responsible
                            government official and be released.</p>
                        <p>6. Now, Tho said, we must avoid the mistakes of the past. American aid
                            has been rapid and efficient but not always intelligent. Above all we
                            need intelligent assistance and firm support for what is right. The
                            Americans must stand up for their own democratic principles and must
                            always insist that what we do helps and not harms our own people,
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> said.</p>
                        <p>7. The implementation of the strategic hamlet must be revised, <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> said. We must find a way to lift up
                            the burden placed on our people and we must somehow pay them for their
                            work. Both General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> and I
                            are realistic, he said. We realize that we too have lost much of the
                            trust of our former supporters in the Delta. The people there have
                            little faith in anyone—the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            Government was but the last in a long string of Governments of broken
                            promises beginning with the French Colonial Government at the beginning
                            of World War II and continuing through those of Bao Dai.</p>
                        <p>8. The main ideas for the Delta which General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> and I have in mind, Tho said, are
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. We will correct the abuses of the past government, such as forced
                            labor, and will do everything possible to raise the morale of the
                            population in the Delta to give them faith in the Government. This they
                            do not now have.</p>
                        <p>b. There is a real need for aggressive local militia seeking out the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in their areas. As fast as we can
                            be assured of their political loyalty we will train and arm the Hoa Hao
                            and Cao Dai population in the Delta and the remaining Catholic groupings
                            not already armed. Their <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0624"/>mission will be mainly local security. We will also win the support of
                            the Khmers and train and arm them—at present they are neutral for the
                            most part.</p>
                        <p>c. We will concentrate on the economic and social development of the
                            hamlets already built to raise the morale of the people, and at the same
                            time provide them with better security which they do not now have.</p>
                        <p>d. We will organize a special effort in the Camau Peninsula to disrupt
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> bases there because this is the
                            main source of funds and trained recruits for the entire <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> effort in the Delta. We will do this by
                            training special ranger groups, mainly composed of Hoa Hao, already
                            familiar with the area, who will carry the fight to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. They will be backed up by mobile,
                            regular military units to strike against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> concentrations.</p>
                        <p>e. We will build more hamlets and we may move some which are now poorly
                            placed but this will be done very selectively and the people will be
                            paid for their work. There will be no more corvee labor.</p>
                        <p>f. We will form a high-level directing and coordinating committee within
                            the Government for the overall pacification effort.</p>
                        <p>9. The Prime Minister then asked me to contact <persName corresp="#p_BVL1">Bui Van Luong</persName> as soon as possible to
                            discuss with him in detail the hamlet program. <persName corresp="#p_LUONG1">Luong</persName>'s appointment was temporary,
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> said, for about two
                            months to assist in an orderly transfer of the program and of the
                            experience gained with it during the previous government. <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> said there would be a meeting at
                            the end of this week between the Government and the Military Committee
                            to make policy decisions concerning the Strategic Hamlet Program.</p>
                        <p>10. During the conversation, I mentioned the actions taken to resume aid
                            as instructed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName>. I
                            also responded to the Prime Minister's request for specific opinions in
                            regard to the Strategic Hamlet Program as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. The Government should form a high-level committee to direct the
                            overall pacification effort of which the Strategic Hamlet Program is a
                            major part.</p>
                        <p>b. The Government should concentrate initially on consolidating existing
                            hamlets and providing them with adequate security and the economic and
                            social benefits promised.</p>
                        <p>c. I agreed with him completely that there must be no more corvee labor,
                            that further work should be compensated for in some manner and that
                                <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> would do everything it could
                            to help the Government raise the morale and win the support of the
                            population in the Delta which was the key to defeating the communists in
                            that area.</p>
                        <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: The Prime Minister had obviously been
                            thinking about the problem of pacifying the Delta for many years, and
                            from his constant references to General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> it was clear that there was a considerable identity
                            of views between them. My impression was that he had a complete grasp of
                            the political realities in the Delta and that for the first time solid
                            progress can be achieved in that area if the U.S. <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0625"/>can develop a military and civilian aid
                            program sufficiently flexible to give support when and where needed. I
                            also received the impression, although he did not specifically so state,
                            that the Prime Minister expects General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> to head the high-level pacification committee.</p>

                                stories, and stated his belief that there were no leaks from the

                        <p>I spoke to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> after
                            dinner last night to sound out his views on the French attitude towards
                            the new regime in Saigon. He gave me to understand that France could be
                            expected to recognize the Government soon, although it might do so in a
                            less formal way than the United States.</p>
                        <p>He asked me what I thought of the prospects for eventual unification and
                            neutralization of North and South Vietnam. I told him that I thought
                            this was a highly unlikely prospect in the foreseeable future, given the
                            relative power balance of the two areas. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said that he thought that the
                            French and U.S. positions were not far apart except on the question of
                            timing. I said that this might be so, but that I had the impression that
                            the French did not take sufficiently into account the problem alluded to
                            by General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> in his exclusive
                            interview with Le Monde several days ago. To be neutral, one had to be
                            strong; and it would take some time to build the necessary strength.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> asked why the
                            United States had been so surprised at General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s statement about South
                            Vietnam prior to the coup. I said that we were not so surprised at the
                            substance of the statement as we were at the timing of it and the fact
                            that it was made without consultation. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> observed rather sourly that
                            since we never consulted them on Southeast Asia, we should not be
                            surprised if they did not consult us.</p>

                        <p>1. Have not seen <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName> article
                            but I believe that the important matter Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> wishes to talk about in
                            Washington is the replacement of General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. The Vietnamese junta members certainly do consider General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> as a symbol of the old order
                            and it is perhaps significant that there is no great depth of contact
                            between U.S. military and the key junta figures. Advisers still have
                            official contact on their military affairs but the Generals are clearly
                            moving in the direction of occupying themselves with the problems of
                            running the country, for which they do not look for advice from the U.S.
                            military. With respect to General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> himself, during the pre-coup period, the junta
                            leaders did not feel they could confide in him without fear of
                            repetition to the Palace. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> as a
                            whole, and specifically General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, were very much caught off base by the coup, in
                            good part because, as he has many times stated, he believed such a
                            development would be unfortunate. Most dramatic example was the briefing
                            given Admiral Felt who departed the very morning of the coup with <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> assertions that no coup would take
                            place. With respect to his assessment of the war, we are on less clear
                            ground as he was talking generally about military and strategic hamlet
                            progress and the opposite view was talking mainly about political
                            dissatisfaction in the cities. Certainly General Harkins' emphasis has
                            been that of a good soldier resolved to take his objective and not being
                            easily deterred by evidence of difficulty or opposition. However, this
                            emphasis on progress and strengthening of the Vietnamese has somewhat
                            obscured the fact that the enemy has only been contained, not reduced in
                            the short term, although containment in this subversive war should lead
                            gradually to reduction.</p>
                        <p>3. With respect to General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' position vis-a-vis Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, it is quite clear that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJH1">Richardson</persName> case was only the
                            overture to the opera. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> has many positive qualities of political sagacity,
                            courage and meticulous insistence on following specific Washington
                            directives, but the fact is that he is running very much a vest-pocket
                            operation and not a country team or total American effort. This method
                            of operation puts a premium on subordinates who can operate on a
                            tactical level rather than as co-workers in the strategic vineyard. The
                            relationship of course has been exacerbated by the incident in which
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> was telling
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> that it was not the time
                            to <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0629"/>run a coup when the
                            Ambassador was trying to support a Vietnamese effort in this direction,
                            by <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' personal
                            intervention with <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> to
                            dissuade him from resigning on the basis of a very private and sensitive
                            conversation <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> had with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DOG1">D'Orlandi</persName> which was reported
                            to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, and the fact that
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> was kept out of the
                            coup planning in response to Washington's instructions to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> that this be discussed only with
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Putting the U.S. effort and the
                            American community into an integrated bundle is made no easier by the
                            absence of any working system of policy coordination, since top level
                            country team meetings are seldom held. On the military side the usual
                            multiplicity of staff and command levels and the emphasis on the
                            statistical approach separate General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> from the highly personalized political
                            activities of <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. In summary, the junta members have no great love for General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> but probably would be content
                            to see him remain on purely technical military level. The Vietnamese
                            themselves are groping around the organizational, bureaucratic and
                            political jungles, trying to turn their convictions and their popular
                            support into specific ways of strengthening the country against its
                            enemy. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> has
                            established a highly positive image in their eyes and in the eyes of
                            many Vietnamese for his obvious support of the revolution. How this
                            image will bear up against their inevitable day-to-day negotiations and
                            collaboration with the working level American community remains to be
                            seen. If the approach is to be the one outlined by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> however it will be clear that
                            the members of the community will have to learn to adjust to his style
                            or be replaced.</p>

                        <p>1. I was informed by General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>
                            on 17 November that General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>
                            would like to see me on the 18th. The appointment was originally
                            scheduled for 1700 and moved up to 1100 by a call from General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>'s aide that same morning.</p>
                        <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0630"/>
                        <p>2. General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, who I have known
                            personally since 1955, was extremely cordial and friendly. He spoke very
                            personally about how he was now playing a role that he had never wanted
                            to play, how he had been the chief instrument of a coup that he had
                            always wished to avoid. He recalled our last conversation together at a
                            dinner at General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>'s house
                            some 8 months ago in which he had remarked that the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government was in a very steep
                            nose-dive and it was questionable whether it could be pulled out in
                            time. He said that he did not know the answer yet. The new government,
                            he stated, had inherited a truly formidable task beyond what any
                            outsider could realize.</p>
                        <p>3. Concerning the Strategic Hamlet Program, General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> said that he had always been in
                            favor of the basic concept which was good, but that it had been
                            misapplied by the previous government and exploited for personal
                            political gain by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. He
                            agreed that it was absolutely necessary to fulfill the implied promises
                            given to that part of the population involved in the program and to
                            consolidate existing hamlets. At the same time, in those areas in the
                            Delta where mass relocation had occurred, he felt that people should be
                            given the choice of returning to their original homes if they really
                            wanted to do so, or of staying in the Strategic Hamlets. He said that
                            Central Vietnam was best suited for the program but that the concept
                            should not have been applied indiscriminately in all parts of the Delta.
                            In those parts of the Delta where people's homes were widely dispersed,
                            a system of constant small unit patrolling combined with armed local
                            militia was the best answer.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> stated that it was
                            important to fit the strategic hamlet into an overall concept of
                            pacification, and to understand that pacification, not spectacular
                            combat actions against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, was the
                            main mission of the military forces. He said that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> were not afraid of spectacular operations
                            involving large units but were afraid of small combat actions and civic
                            action operations which would disrupt and destroy their support
                            organization, both outside and within existing strategic hamlets. The
                            way to break up their organization was to win the support of the
                            population by working with them and gaining their confidence.</p>
                        <p>5. To carry out pacification successfully, according to <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, the Army would have to be
                            reorganized on a territorial basis. The existing inverted pyramid of
                            enormous staff organization at corps and division level would have to be
                            reversed and reponsibilities decentralized. The corps were staffed by
                            “bureaucrats” not soldiers. He said that units would be assigned to a
                            defined area and given a pacification mission within that area for an
                            extended period of time. Small unit highly mobile operations would be
                            emphasized. He envisaged that there would be greater decentralization of
                            responsibility to subordinate echelons, that they would be given the
                            authority to operate without <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0631"/>constant reference to higher headquarters. This would also apply to
                            the province chiefs. If officials at the province and unit level fail to
                            produce results, then they would be replaced, but no longer would they
                            be required to constantly refer to higher echelons or to Saigon.</p>
                        <p>6. General Minh said that one of the greatest problems the new regime
                            faced was the lack of qualified civil or military personnel to accept
                            responsible positions in the provinces. He said he would prefer to have
                            civilians as district chiefs and province chiefs, if at all possible. In
                            this connection, he wondered what had happened to all the NIA (National
                            Institute of Administration) graduates and where they were. The problem
                            is that they are so understaffed with qualified people. He said he would
                            very much like to have a list of these people and where they were now.
                            He was also interested in special training courses for civilian and
                            military district chiefs.</p>
                        <p>7. What made the task of picking up and carrying on from the previous
                            government particularly difficult was the widespread corruption existing
                            in the provinces, according to <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>. Practically everybody had been involved, he said.
                            Now the problem was what to do with these people because they were, for
                            the most part, also the only trained administrators and technicians in
                            Vietnam. He indicated that the new government intended to punish the
                            most flagrant cases and transfer others to different provinces.
                            Hereafter, he said, instead of permitting this type of corruption to
                            continue, the first few province chiefs caught stealing would be shot.
                            This might seem a bloody solution, he stated, but it was necessary to
                            make examples. At this point I suggested that if he could make an
                            example of a relative of some high official in the new government, this
                            would be even more impressive. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> said that the Americans had no idea how extensive
                            corruption had been under the previous government or the effect it had
                            had on the morale of the population. He said that many province and
                            district chiefs had sold <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> barbed wire
                            to the population who knew very well that the barbed wire had been given
                            free by the U.S. One thing that a lot of people have never realized, he
                            said, is that the average peasant is very intelligent. He knows when he
                            is being robbed, and he knows the difference between good and bad
                            government. The population in the countryside asks very little, only an
                            opportunity to farm their rice fields in peace and that they were very
                            cooperative if treated justly. He cited two particular cases of
                            corruption examples. In the Province of Nhatrang, the old province chief
                            had apparently demanded a substantial pay-off to grant licenses to sell
                            either rice or fish in the province. This had, in effect, created two
                            monopolies. When the old province chief was removed many individuals
                            came to the new one to ask permission to sell their rice. When the new
                            province chief told them that anyone who wanted to sell their products
                            could do so without restriction, people actually broke down and cried.
                            He said the <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0632"/>corruption in
                            higher circles of the government had been even worse. For instance,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> had already been
                            approached by a group of Chinese who wanted his cooperation in
                            continuing to monopolize the Camau charcoal trade. They had offered to
                            give 50,000,000 piastres to the Army and 20,000,000 piastres to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>. He said that this was
                            typical of the way things had been done under the previous
                            government.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> said that the only way to
                            correct this kind of abuse was to re-orient officials in the provinces
                            and to carry out not only announced but also surprise inspections. He
                            said that he agreed that it was necessary to get out into the provinces,
                            see what was going on and make on-the-spot corrections. He said he would
                            do this personally. The previous government, he felt, had had little
                            contact with the population. Most officials were constantly looking over
                            their shoulder to Saigon. These attitudes would have to be changed. He
                            again reiterated that he intended to play a leading role in this by
                            making personal inspections in the field. He said that changing the
                            attitudes of most government officials towards the population was
                            perhaps the most important task the government had to accomplish.</p>
                        <p>9. In the Delta, General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>
                            stated, the new government's policy would be to help groups such as the
                            Hoa Hao to defend their home areas. This would be a major objective. At
                            the same time, an improved approach to pacification would be tried in
                            other areas. He said that he would select Long An as a model province
                            for the new approach because it was one of the toughest and was, at the
                            same time, accessible to Saigon. Captain Dao, soon to be promoted to
                            Major, and currently General <persName corresp="#p_LVKBG1">Le Van
                                Kim</persName>'s aide, was to be selected as Province Chief.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> also said that a
                            special effort would be made in the Camau region, utilizing Hoa Hao
                            commands along with mobile regular forces to break up <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> support operations. He said that the main
                            support for almost everything the VC did in the Delta came from their
                            Camau base. At the same time they would attempt, he said, to break the
                            back of the charcoal racket. He said influential people had been
                            involved in this since 1954 and were, in effect, on the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> payroll. It would be difficult and
                            complicated because the Chinese were also involved.</p>
                        <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Nothing in General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>'s personal manner that the writer
                            could notice, has changed since he became the Chief of State. He is as
                            unpretentious and candid as in the past. He obviously has no illusions
                            about the difficulties ahead or that the main task of leadership falls
                            on him. He is still the only top Vietnamese leader, known to the writer,
                            who projects the personal warmth and sympathy required to stir popular
                            enthusiasm in Vietnam. The man has the <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0633"/>necessary elements of a popular leader in his character
                            but he will have to be pushed into assuming this role because he is
                            essentially a humble man.</p>

                        <p>2540. 1. General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, accompanied
                            by Generals <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> and <hi rend="italic">Khiem</hi>, stated 19 November that Gen <persName corresp="#p_DVBMMG1">Big Minh</persName> had invited General Phoumi
                            pay an incognito and discreet visit to Saigon at end November. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> believes it particularly essential
                            establish good relationships with Laos in order permit a collaborative
                            effort along Lao-Vietnam border against Viet Cong lines of supply and
                            communication. He said that Laotians do not have sufficient force to
                            cover this area themselves and are quite willing and anxious that
                            Vietnamese assist but Vietnamese wish to be correct in clearing any such
                            activity with Laos. Vietnamese would use Special Forces units in
                            civilian clothes as regular army would not handle matter discreetly
                            enough. Don said they had high regard for General Phoumi and look
                            forward to fruitful relationships with him.</p>
                        <p>2. Following points were made in reply to General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>:</p>
                        <p>a. Importance of including <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> in any contacts with Laos. We believe, and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> agreed, that neutralists
                            and General Phoumi forces working very well together and it important to
                            maintain this close collaboration in interests of free world.</p>
                        <p>b. Importance of maintaining some form of balance in Laos rather than
                            taking too vigorous a position, as open conflict invites major <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> participation and although we are
                            working on it, up to now we have not built adequate strength on
                            non-Communist side to withstand an onslaught.</p>
                        <p>c. Within these limits we concur with desirability of continuing and
                            stepping up discreetly handled Vietnamese operations in cross border
                            area of same nature we trained for and initiated in 1961 and early 1962,
                            suspended during period immediately after Geneva Accords of 1962 and
                            have endeavored to resume in recent months with first results just
                            coming in.</p>

                                <p>“From what I can gather the Honolulu Meeting is shaping up into a
                                    replica of its predecessors, i.e., an eight-hour briefing
                                    conducted in the usual military manner. In the past this has
                                    meant about 100 people in the <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> Conference Room, who are treated to a

                            appear to be united and determined to step up the war effort. They
                            profess to be keenly aware that the struggle with the Viet Cong is not
                            only a military problem, but is also political and psychological. They
                            attach great importance to a social and economic program as an aid to
                            winning the war. The Generals believe that</p>
                        <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0635"/>
                        <p>(1) The requirements for the population to contribute what amounts to
                            “forced labor” in connection with the construction of strategic hamlets
                            must be drastically reduced, if not totally eliminated.</p>
                        <p>(2) The Strategic Hamlet Program has been pushed too rapidly and at too
                            great a cost in human effort. More emphasis must be placed on the
                            sociological aspects of the program. Existing strategic hamlets must be
                            consolidated and improved. Any further wholesale expansion of the
                            program should be deferred.</p>
                        <p>(3) Chinese racketeers and extortionists—the so-called “cailles”—must be
                            eliminated.</p>
                        <p>(4) The procedure of arbitrary arrests and disregard of habeas corpus
                            must end.</p>
                        <p>(5) Major efforts must be made to win over the Hoa Hao and Cao Dai sects
                            to the side of the government. (Recent reports indicate some initial
                            successes in this direction.)</p>
                        <p>Resumption of U.S. aid should improve the economic situation. The U.S.
                            should for this first year avoid a situation in which it appears that
                            the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime received more
                            aid than the new government.</p>
                        <p>As far as political institutions are concerned, the Generals talk of
                            facilitating the growth of political parties and of creating more courts
                            and judges, but much of this seems theoretical. Western-educated urban
                            elements expect progress in political liberalization and perhaps the
                            Council of Sages<note n="2" xml:id="d321fn2">According to telegram 1092
                                from Saigon, November 20, the Council of Sages was formally
                                established by the Provisional Government as a smaller Council of
                                Notables, still intended to be advisory and broadly representative
                                of Vietnamese society. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15-1 <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss> VIET)</note> will be able to do something to fulfill
                            this need for political expression.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> doubted the
                            wisdom of the U.S. making sweeping demands for democratization or for
                            early elections at this time. He believed that in Vietnam the technique
                            of changing governments by violent means is not yet ready to be
                            displaced in favor of changing governments by election. He emphasized
                            that if we can get through the next six months without a serious falling
                            out among the Generals we will be lucky. However, the leading members of
                            the Generals' group are modern-minded men who are at least aware of
                            conditions in the modern world other than in the strictly military
                            field. They evince a desire to react intelligently to the social,
                            economic and political factors, and their performance to date in this
                            sphere has been good. Americans—whether in government or in the
                            press—should not seek to guide them at every turn nor try to get them to
                            act as though they were made in our image. As long as they follow the
                            course they have set for themselves, we should not push them too hard
                            for several months. Since coming to power, the new leaders of Vietnam
                            have acted with restraint. They have held down on arrests, have been
                            willing to correct errors, and have avoided any wholesale <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0636"/>purges throughout the governmental
                            administration. Their handling of press and public relations generally
                            is a great improvement. They are trying to please the public—a rather
                            new departure in Vietnam. Although the question of where the true power
                            and influence lies will not become clear until the pulling and hauling
                            of various personalities has made itself felt, the Generals appear to
                            have really tried to have a big civilian element in the government.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            remarked that what we are really trying to do in Vietnam is to win the
                            minds of the people. This includes not only the Generals and people who
                            are currently living under <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> control,
                            but also the Viet Cong. The problem is to convince the young VC soldier
                            that if he continues to fight he will surely be killed, but that if he
                            stops he will find that he and his family have an opportunity for a good
                            life in peace and security. Problem thus is not only military, but
                            economic, social and political as well.</p>
                        <p>For the first time in years the central government has the enthusiastic
                            support of the urban population. However, in the final analysis the war
                            will be won or lost in the country-side and to date the rural population
                            is still apathetic.</p>
                        <p>The changed situation requires us to rethink our programs, civil and
                            military. We must see whether and how our programs need changing. For
                            example, with regard to our military programs, the question arises
                            whether—with a real chain of command, an improved fighting spirit, the
                            commitment of troops to fight the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            instead of to static non-military missions—present and proposed force
                            levels are appropriate.</p>
                        <p>To take another example, in our economic programs aimed at the rural
                            areas, we have developed procedures to deal directly with Province
                            Chiefs. This was done largely because of the lassitude of the central
                            bureaucracy and its apparent lack of interest in what happened in the
                            countryside. Perhaps it is still wise to continue to by-pass Saigon so
                            far as possible, but it would be well to review the question. We may be
                            about to get a “new look” in the Saigon bureaucracy.</p>
                        <p>Finally, as regards all U.S. programs-military, economic,
                            psychological-we should continue to keep before us the goal of setting
                            dates for phasing out U.S. activities and turning them over to the
                            Vietnamese; and these dates, too, should be looked at again in the light
                            of the new political situation. The date mentioned in the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> statement of October 2<note n="3" xml:id="d321fn3">
                                <ref target="#d167">Document 167</ref>.</note> on U.S. military
                            withdrawal had-and is still having-a tonic effect. We should set dates
                            for <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> programs, too. We can always grant last-minute
                            extensions if we think it wise to do so.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said all this is
                            submitted in the belief that an American presence will be wanted-and
                            needed-in Vietnam for some time in the future. But it should perhaps be
                            a different kind of presence from what exists—and is needed—in Vietnam
                            today.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked whether we
                            could expect to encourage the new government to move closer toward a
                            true democracy without thereby reducing the main effort against the VC.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that as
                            an example forced labor could be reduced although not entirely. He went
                            on to say that while we can expect some progress toward democratic
                            processes at the local village and hamlet level it is hard for him to
                            imagine a sophisticated Western democracy emerging in Vietnam for some
                            time to come.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked if there was
                            any way the U.S. could hope to prevent a future internal split between
                            the Generals. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            replied that this can best be accomplished by making sure that they
                            understand what the U.S. considers would be best for their country. He
                            noted that the Generals recognized the advantages of sticking together.
                            In addition to other actions, the Ambassador said if we make it clear,
                            for example, that we have confidence in General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> it will materially help his
                            position among his colleagues and probably will serve to retain him in
                            his present position of authority. From his own conversation with
                            Generals <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> is confident that they want to avoid any internal
                            disputes among the members of the Military Revolutionary Council. These
                            three key Generals believe that they can keep General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> under control. However,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> is not too sure
                            this is the case, as General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>, in addition to being Minister of Security, also
                            commands the troops of III Corps.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked what were
                            the present intentions of the military leaders with respect to the
                            ultimate shape of the government. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that he believes that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> is sincere when he
                            says that the Military Revolutionary Council is merely a provisional
                            government. However, there is no political leadership emerging from the
                            scene thus far and he doubts that it will come from any of the civilians
                            who are now in the Cabinet. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> re-emphasized his earlier recommendation that the
                            U.S. not press the Generals too hard on political reforms and early
                            elections. He would instead urge that the U.S. be patient and give the
                            Generals a chance to get on with the war. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> believes that they are sincere,
                            that they have the good of their country at heart, and that they have a
                            basically sound program.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary of Discussion</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> began by pointing
                            out that despite what has appeared in the press, there is no difference
                            of opinion between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and himself on the situation in Vietnam or on the
                            conduct of the war against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> expressed his
                            complete agreement.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the military situation in Vietnam, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> emphasized that the problem is
                            one of people, not statistics. The problem is to win the people over to
                            the full support of the war effort. Until the new government gets out in
                            the field and talks to the people and reams their problems and true
                            feelings, they can never hope to really win the war.</p>
                        <p>As for the statistics, after the coup <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            incidents shot up to 300-400% of what they were before. However, after 6
                            November they dropped down to normal and have remained that way ever
                            since. Similarly, the numbers of returnees under the Chieu Hoi program
                            fell off markedly since early October. However, just this past week over
                            350 members of the Hoa Hao Sect have rallied to the government, as have
                            a number of Cao Dais. At the same time, the Montagnard tribes are
                            continuing to come out of the hills to seek the protection of the
                            government. (About 220,000 had rallied to the government before the coup
                            as a result of such programs as the <gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss>. At present a total of about 400,000 Montagnards are
                            under <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> control.)</p>
                        <p>The change of government has had a definite impact at the province level,
                            where everything focuses on the Province Chief. These 42 key individuals
                            have the real job of winning the people over to the support of the
                            government. Perhaps even more important than the Province Chief is the
                            District Chief, of whom there are over 253 throughout the country. As
                            these officials are definitely associated with the old government
                            insofar as the villager is concerned, we must expect that the new regime
                            will probably want to reassign nearly all of them to emphasize the
                            complete break with past policy.</p>
                        <p>As to the situation within the officer ranks generally, there is still
                            much to be done. There remain a lot of deserving officers who should be
                            promoted. General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> is well
                            aware of this point. The role of Generals <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri</persName> in
                            the II and I Corps, respectively, is still not clear although they have
                            associated themselves with the objectives of the coup. General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> intends to establish a more
                            direct chain of command and insure that military orders will be carried
                            out when received. This will be quite a change for the good as in the
                            past a military order was seldom implemented until the responsible
                            commander had checked it out through political channels back to the
                            Palace.</p>

                        <p>The principal problems the new government faces are: first, the
                            appointment of new Province and District Chiefs will inevitably
                            complicate matters until these new officials are able to become
                            acquainted with their areas of responsibility and get on top of the
                            local situation; second, the establishment of a straightforward military
                            chain of command will, of course, involve some high level negotiations
                            among the Generals themselves; third, the people in the rural areas
                            still remain apathetic to the government; fourth, the support of the man
                            in the village and hamlet will depend on whether the government can
                            assure him security and do something to improve his current marginal
                            existence.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked how Province
                            and District Chiefs were selected-were they natives of the area to which
                            they were assigned? General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> stated that the selection of these key officials
                            was done by Generals <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> in consultation with the
                            Corps Commander concerned. He emphasized that those Province Chiefs who
                            were being relieved would not be wasted; they would be reassigned to
                            other positions where they could make use of their experience.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> emphasized again
                            that we must expect that it will take a little time for things to settle
                            down again after this change of administration. The new government is
                            discovering a lot of things that it did not know. For example, some 50
                            tons of ammunition were found stored in the Presidential Guard barracks.
                            Another problem the new government is considering, for example, is what
                            to do with the gendarmerie. The question arises as to whether it is
                            better to have these outstanding <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>s
                            engaged in police functions primarily within the Capitol area, or
                            whether they could better serve the nation by being reintegrated into
                            the Army and sent out to fight the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a description of a slide show given by <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>.]</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Item A 3</hi>—Review of Situation (Economic)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary of Discussion</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName> took the lead on this
                            item, noting the difficulties experienced with the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime in its latter days and
                            pointing out the opportunity which now existed for more effective
                            collaboration between the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>
                            under the new regime. The Generals are seeking means to improve
                            government administration, to get the most out of U.S. aid, and to win
                            the war as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Initial U.S. efforts in the economic field are directed toward
                            encouraging the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> to establish a
                            central ministry for economic policy and planning, including all aspects
                            of foreign aid. This idea has been well received by the Prime Minister
                            and working level officials. The fact that the Prime Minister has
                            already assumed direct responsibility for supervision of the Ministry of
                            Finance and National Economy is a <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0640"/>first step in this direction. The Prime Minister is
                            well informed on the economic problems of his country. In an informal
                            session with him on 7 November 1963, agreement in principle was reached
                            on the following points, details to be worked out as circumstances
                            permit:</p>
                        <p>a. All economic aid matters will be handled through the Prime Minister's
                            office.</p>
                        <p>b. All strategic hamlet matters will be handled through the Prime
                            Minister's office.</p>
                        <p>c. A mixed U.S.-Vietnamese group can be established to study the economic
                            situation, isolate problems, and recommend solutions. The <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> team would include Dean Thuc; the
                            Minister of Rural Affairs, Mr. <persName>Quang</persName>; and the
                            Director General of Planning, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>d. Budget matters, except military, will also be under control of the
                            Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>Areas of priority attention would be taxation; exploitation of farmers,
                            fishermen, and small artisans by middlemen; inefficient government
                            procedures; use of foreign aid; joint U.S.-<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> budgeting; and marketing policies for rice, fish, and
                            fertilizer.</p>
                        <p>The total requirements for U.S. aid remain large. Defense expenditures
                            (including <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>) equal nearly 1/4 of the
                            country's national income and substantially exceed the entire fiscal
                            revenue of the central government. The Country Team recognizes the
                            limitations on foreign aid funds imposed by Congress, but recommends
                            maintenance of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63 level in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64 and 65. Beside the economic rationale,
                            it appears politically and psychologically necessary to extend at least
                            the same measure of support to the new regime as was extended to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Upon U.S. recognition of the new <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> on 8
                            November, a commercial import and <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480,
                            Title I program were resumed to cover urgently required materials and
                            items. An amendment to the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480, Title
                            I program was negotiated to provide 4.3 million dollars worth of wheat
                            flour and sweetened condensed milk.</p>
                        <p>Since the pipeline for essential commodities is refilled, our present
                            posture is to carefully review specific requests of the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. Our intention is to maintain leverage
                            and avoid the impression of giving a blank check. We are hopeful that a
                            few months experience will allow negotiation of a more substantial
                            installment of aid in return for <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>
                            cooperation along lines desired by the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Two additional facts of the commercial import program should be
                            mentioned. First, it was undoubtedly the realization that the U.S. could
                            not be bluffed into restoring import financing that finally provided the
                            spark that set off the coup. Second, there is no indication that the
                            Vietnamese economy was harmed by the suspension in any fundamental
                            respect. Prices of indigenously produced commodities pursued the usual
                            seasonal patterns and price increases in imported <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0641"/>commodities were anticipated with the
                            notable exception of condensed milk and flour. Local production
                            apparently was not seriously affected.</p>
                        <p>On the social side there are a number of encouraging signs. The new
                            Minister of Security and the new Chief of Police both recognize that
                            there must be an end to fear and hatred of the government. The police
                            must be restrained and re-educated. This same concern for popular
                            feeling has also been expressed by the new Minister of Information, the
                            new Minister of Education, and by the new Minister of Labor. During Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName>'s calls upon six of the
                            new Ministers, all have been unanimous in expressing their beliefs that
                            the future of Vietnam must be determined by the people of Vietnam
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>As for the students and the Buddhists, both groups feel that as
                            originators of events that led to the coup, they deserve special
                            treatment. The Buddhist associations are being listened to by the new
                            government and are exerting a calming influence. The students on the
                            other hand, except in Hue, are demanding dismissals of governmental and
                            educational officials and a number of other changes. They are organizing
                            into associations with definite political objectives and may continue to
                            be a problem. The new government hopes that they can be developed as a
                            constructive force. In this connection, General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> is working with a group of
                            students for the establishment of a Vietnamese Peace Corps so that the
                            younger generation can channel their energies into worthwhile civic
                            action type activities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName> concluded that there is
                            an entirely new spirit in Vietnam; that the new government is confident,
                            but not overconfident; that it is warmly disposed toward the U.S., and,
                            that we have opportunities to exploit that we never had before. The
                            Vietnamese are soberly aware that if this present experiment fails there
                            will probably be no second chance.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked if the former
                            Secretary of State at the Presidency, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>, was usable in the new government. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> stated that <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> would probably prefer some post
                            outside of the country, and that Generals <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> may
                            well use him later as an Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then asked to what
                            extent the U.S. officials shared offices with Vietnamese compatriots.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName> replied that at the
                            province level they do, but very little at the government level.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that this
                            might be desirable if the Vietnamese would agree.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William P. Bundy</persName> asked if the
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> had purchased milk and flour
                            from France following the suspension of the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName>
                            replied they had since U.S. supplies were not available for delivery in
                            time to meet the government's requirements and since France was prepared
                            to divert a ship for the purpose. However, after conversations <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0642"/>with the Prime Minister, the
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> agreed to reduce these orders by
                            50% since the U.S. can now supply these commodities on the desired
                            schedule. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            then inquired as to the estimated size of the rice crop, to which Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName> replied that they hope
                            to have a 300,000 ton export this year, and that due to improved seed
                            and fertilizer it could be approximately 30% more by next year.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said it would
                            be worth considering the diversion of a substantial amount of U.S. aid
                            to provide more fertilizer and thereby increase rice production. For a
                            relatively small dollar outlay for fertilizer we could raise the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>'s income from its rice exports
                            appreciably. As it will probably not be possible for the new government
                            to raise taxes, the only solution to its economic problem is to increase
                            its exports. This means an increased requirement for fertilizer and
                            seed. He asked the Group 1 subcommittee<note n="4" xml:id="d321fn4">Group 1 was the subcommittee dealing with economic problems. It
                                included as members <persName corresp="#p_JSJ1">Janow</persName>,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SWG1">Stoneman</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TMGC1">Major General Timmes</persName>, Silver, and
                                others.</note> to look into this further. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> then asked if the new government
                            would have to relax economic controls, or if it could take steps to
                            raise additional taxes or to improve tax collection. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that it was
                            too early to give an answer to this and Minister Trueheart added that
                            while the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> can improve tax
                            collection, it would not be feasible to increase direct taxes on items
                            in heavy demand such as milk, for example. Admiral Felt stated that
                            there were some cases where the people were subjected to double taxation
                            by both the government and the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.
                            Perhaps as the areas of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> control were
                            reduced, the government might be able to increase its tax collections.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that we
                            must be realistic. The new government cannot be expected to establish a
                            standard of austerity too soon, nor can it count on much increased
                            revenue from improved tax collection procedures. The only solution seems
                            to be greater emphasis on increasing productivity in the export sector
                            of the economy.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of agenda item A4, “Review of the Situation
                            (Province Summaries),” given by <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            stated that while the Country Team considered all provinces critical,
                            they singled out 13 which were “particularly critical because of their
                            current problems.” Those provinces were Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Phuoc
                            Thanh, Binh Duong, Tay Ninh, Hau Nghia, Long An, Kien Tuong, Dinh Tuong,
                            Kien Hoa, Chnong Thien, and An Xuyen. The state of this last province on
                            the Ca Mau peninsula occasioned the more general discussion printed
                            below.]</p>
                        <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0643"/>
                        <p>An Xuyen, on the extreme tip of the Ca Mau peninsula is safe in the
                            cities, but the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> really own the
                            province. They have been in control since the early forties. There is
                            considerable production of rice and of charcoal, amounting to some $10
                            million a year. Much of this revenue is siphoned off by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Some of the produce goes to Thailand and
                            some to Singapore as well as to Saigon. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> is investigating the feasibility of a combined
                            naval-economic blockade to cut off the flow of revenue to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> emphasized the
                            need for the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> to get trained
                            intelligence personnel into the strategic hamlets to identify the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and keep them from forming Communist
                            cells. Security of the informer is the key to the problem. Thus far
                            there have not been sufficient military forces at the village level to
                            make it safe for people to report on the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked if the reason that so many strategic
                            hamlets were not considered successful in the Delta was for security,
                            economic, or political reasons, or all three. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Fraleigh</persName> stated that they were
                            unsuccessful in all three. However, in the northern areas of Vietnam 60%
                            of the hamlets were considered successful.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that he
                            believed there were three things to do in the Delta: first, get the
                            Chieu Hoi Program moving; second, get the fertilizer program going to
                            increase output of rice; and third, and most important, improve the
                            security of the strategic hamlets by arming the trained militia and
                            increasing the number of militia.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> added that the
                            leaders of the new government must get out of Saigon and talk to the
                            people in the Delta area.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> remarked that this
                            discussion points up the fact that the war is different in each
                            province. Perhaps we need joint U.S.-Vietnam province teams to attack
                            the problem at the province level. He asked if the criticality of the
                            thirteen provinces was based purely on military assessment. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said it was not;
                            that it was across the board.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> then gave a
                            political summary of the current situation throughout the provinces
                            making the following points:</p>
                        <p>a. Most of the population is aware of the coup.</p>
                        <p>b. Most of the population is reserved in their opinion of the coup and
                            are waiting to see what effects it will have on their daily lives.</p>
                        <p>c. Major programs are now stalled at the province level awaiting
                            instructions from the central government.</p>
                        <p>d. Numerous changes and impending changes of province chiefs have
                            contributed to the uncertainty and inactivity at the province level.</p>
                        <p>e. The death of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is
                            regretted; the death of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is
                            not.</p>
                        <p>f. Public opinion concerning U.S. involvement in the coup is mixed.
                            Cooperation between <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> and U.S.
                            personnel is closer than ever before.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated he
                            assumed that the first effort would be made to protect the hamlets that
                            have already been built. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> said the whole Strategic Hamlet Program was
                            under intensive review. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked how long this would take. Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> estimated that it
                            would be two to three months before the revised program could get under
                            way. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> recommended
                            that any new plans that are prepared should establish firm target dates
                            for various phases, so that tangible check points on <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> progress would be available.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary of Discussion</p>
                        <p>Mr. Silver reviewed the economic situation in South Vietnam noting that
                            the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> expenditures have risen about
                            60% in the period 1960-1964 while U.S. aid, which amounts to about 40%
                            of the central government's revenue, has declined somewhat. This
                            increase in expenditures is nearly entirely attributable to an increase
                            in defense expenditures, a 100% increase from 1960 to 1964. In addition,
                            the increase for civil expenditures included non-military costs for
                            counterinsurgency, and as a major item, support for the strategic hamlet
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the 1964 budget, the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government estimated the total budget deficit in
                            1964 at approximately 9.0 billion plasters. After adjustments to his
                            figures, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> believes that the deficit
                            will more likely be in the order of 7.0 billion plasters. This 7.0
                            billion plasters <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0645"/>represent
                            about one third of the total money supply; about 8% of the GNP; and an
                            equivalent deficit in the U.S. budget of close to $50.0 billion.</p>
                        <p>South Vietnam is primarily agricultural, with a small industrial base.
                            This is significant since the economy does not have the capacity to
                            expand and meet the increasing demand for goods. Although prices have
                            not gone up appreciably despite increased defense expenditures during
                            the past years, it is not believed this situation will continue through
                            1964 unless the projected deficit is neutralized.</p>
                        <p>A previous backlog of U.S. economic aid and a pump-priming operation to
                            get the strategic hamlet program started has had the effect of reducing
                            central government expenditures in the past. In addition, the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> has reduced its foreign exchange
                            holdings from about $200.0 million in 1961 to about $155.0 million in
                            1962. Fortunately, these holdings have been rising in recent months
                            because of stepped-up rice exports.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>'s proposal is that U.S. and <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> personnel should sit down together and
                            discuss these problems with a view toward developing agreed joint
                            solutions. In general, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>'s
                            recommendations would be to improve the efficiency of tax collections,
                            increase taxes on selected items (e.g., gasoline), reduce the civil
                            budget by 1.0 billion plasters, maintain the 1964 military expenditures
                            at the 1963 level if this is consistent with the war effort, and
                            introduce attractive savings programs, including increased use of the
                            national lottery, rural banks, war bonds, etc. Also, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> believes that the economy can stand
                            an increase in money supply of 1.0 to 1.5 billion plasters without
                            serious effects.</p>
                        <p>All of this leaves the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> about 2.0
                            billion plasters short in their budget. USOM would recommend that this
                            be met by drawing down on their foreign exchange reserves which amount
                            to about $170.0 million at present.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then asked for
                            comments on the export/import status. Mr. Silver said that in 1960 the
                            foreign exchange earnings were $88.0 million. In 1961 it dropped to
                            $70.0 million due to a drop in price of rice and rubber on the world
                            market. In 1962 earnings dropped further to $47.0 million due to floods
                            which wiped out the usual rice exports. The estimate for this year comes
                            to about $80.0 million with the projection for 1965 hopefully at $95.0
                            million. Present imports are about $250.0 million. This figure does not
                            include <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> or strategic hamlet inputs,
                            but does include <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>. In response to a
                            question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName>, Mr.
                            Silver pointed out that this analysis only relates to government and not
                            to the private sector.</p>
                        <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0646"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William P. Bundy</persName> asked why a
                            2.0 billion plaster deficit in 1964 was considered important when there
                            had been 3.0 to 4.0 billion plaster deficits in 1962 and 1963. Mr.
                            Silver replied that prices have risen 15% in the last three years and
                            this, plus cumulative deficits of this magnitude could well become
                            serious.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that
                            one of the charts showed a 20% increase in the money supply during the
                            first part of this year and asked how this was to be absorbed. Mr.
                            Silver said apparently much of this money was cash hoardings. There were
                            also reports that quantities of cash were being held by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> as a precaution against the day when the
                            strategic hamlet program would cut them off from their current sources
                            of revenue from the countryside.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> expressed
                            concern that this huge increase in money supply in combination with a
                            deficit of 7.0 billion plasters could lead to price increases which in
                            turn could create such serious political problems that the present
                            government might not be able to survive. It will be hard enough for the
                            new government to consolidate its position as it is. It is absolutely
                            essential that we help it maintain economic stability over the next 12
                            to 18 months. Under the best of circumstances the hoped for transfer of
                            power from the military to some form of civilian government will be a
                            very difficult political operation. Under conditions of economic
                            instability it will be almost impossible.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated he was
                            of the opinion the U.S. should lean over backwards to help the Generals
                            avoid economic unrest. With a tremendous deficit lying ahead, this is
                            going to be very difficult. The United States should not try to push
                            this new government too far to raise taxes, tighten up administration,
                            reduce budgets, and so forth. Economic stability is really the
                            foundation of military security in the long run. He would be prepared,
                            therefore, to take a calculated risk and cut some of our safety factors
                            on the military side if this were necessary to insure economic
                            stability.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> agreed that the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> was facing a very difficult and
                            dangerous economic siutation which could be extremely serious to the
                            whole war effort. Our first objective should be to get together with the
                            Vietnamese to be sure we understand one another. Toward this end, plans
                            are being made to send out a prominent figure in the economic field as
                            head of a U.S. economic mission which would tackle these problems
                            jointly with the best Vietnamese economists. This is clearly what must
                            be undertaken in the next couple of months.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JSJ1">Janow</persName> then commented further
                            on the import level. He said that in 1962 imports were about $280
                            million. This year the estimate (including our aid) is about $238
                            million and for 1964 the planning figure is about $255 million. If this
                            commercial import level is compared with their exports of about $100
                            million, there is a gap of about <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0647"/>$150 million. This deficit does not include such costs as <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, the counter-insurgency program which
                            the US is supporting, or capital investment. If these are added the
                            figure is increased by another $250 million. A gap of this kind, built
                            into the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> economy is obviously
                            against their best interest.</p>
                        <p>Major General <persName corresp="#p_TMGC1">Timmes</persName> then spoke
                            about the military budget. Using charts he showed that the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> regular forces would require about 11.2
                            billion plasters. 75% of this would go to military pay, allowance, and
                            subsistence. General <persName corresp="#p_TMGC1">Timmes</persName>
                            emphasized that this is the Vietnam plaster budget. The <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> budget amounts to about $175 million.
                            He then showed a comparison of this year and last year's <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> military budget. This showed that the
                            current budget is only 358 million plasters larger than last year's and
                            the forces are much larger. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            believes that this budget has been reduced to the minimum figure.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMGC1">Timmes</persName> showed the figures
                            for the Civil Guard and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>. He pointed
                            out that 86% of the Civil Guard and 95% of the Self Defense Force
                            budgets were for pay and allowances. His final chart showed how the
                            total defense cost of 14.5 billion plasters for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 64 was made up. He noted that perhaps this figure could
                            be reduced by 100 to 200 million plasters as a result of force
                            reorganizations which might take place under the new government.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out
                            that the difference between these figures and Mr. Silver's program came
                            to 750 million plasters. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then asked how much of a limiting factor was money
                            as far as finishing the war at an early date. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that in his opinion the
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> is going to be right on the
                            ragged edge of running out of the money needed to win the war. The
                            situation in the Delta and strategic hamlet program itself are both
                            serious, immediate problems. Furthermore, we must improve the output of
                            the country. This means more fertilizers, additional expenditures to
                            raise the economic base and increase productivity. He stated that all
                            this requires money. The <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> has this
                            tremendous deficit; the new government is sitting on top of a keg of
                            political dynamite. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> doubts that enough money has been budgeted
                            under <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to handle the situation. This is very serious problem
                            which must be watched extremely carefully.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> shared Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s concern. More
                            money may be required to finance what ought to be the heaviest action
                            year of the war. If things move successfully, it might be possible to
                            taper off after the next 12 to 15 months. However, we must be careful
                            not to give the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> any more of a
                            “fiscal hangover” from the war than necessary. He agreed with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that it is a
                            serious problem which could blow up on us if we are not careful in the
                            next six months. But, <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0648"/>we must
                            also keep the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>'s feet to the fire,
                            keep their resources fully committed, and not let them saddle themselves
                            with an economy and military establishment that is larger than
                            circumstances require.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Fraleigh</persName> then discussed the
                            advantages of increased use of fertilizer on rice production. Vietnam
                            uses very little fertilizer on rice as compared to other countries. As a
                            result, its per hectare yield of rice is i/2 that of Taiwan or Japan.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Fraleigh</persName> recommends that we
                            think in terms of doubling the use of fertilizer in 1964. For every $70
                            spent on a ton of fertilizer delivered in Vietnam, $110 worth of
                            additional milled rice is produced for export. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> wondered what was holding it back.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Fraleigh</persName> replied it was the
                            credit system, since fertilizer is handled commercially. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> observed that
                            unless an adequate credit system is devised to improve the distribution
                            of fertilizer, the productivity will not rise and this productivity is
                            needed to build political stability. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> remarked that South Vietnam
                            could be one of the richest rice producing areas of the world.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he was
                            afraid a certain euphoria had settled over us since the coup. True, the
                            Generals are friendly to us, but the situation in Cambodia is
                            deteriorating and the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> showed they have
                            a tremendous reserve capability by trebling their rate of incidents week
                            before last. He wondered if current U.S. programs put enough power
                            behind our objectives.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> noted that the
                            Japanese might be able to work something out with the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> on a rice-fertilizer barter basis. This
                            would be a matter that could be explored during his forthcoming
                            trip.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> summarized the
                            present situation as follows. South Vietnam is under tremendous pressure
                            from the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are as numerous today as they were a year or two years
                            ago. The surrounding area is weaker. The Cambodian situation is
                            potentially very serious to the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. The
                            input of arms from Cambodia before the recent developments was very
                            worrisome in the Delta. The Generals head a very fragile government. The
                            United States should not try to cut the comers too fine. We must be
                            prepared to devote enough resources to this job of winning the war to be
                            certain of accomplishing it instead of just hoping to accomplish it.</p>

                        <p>Exploratory discussions would be held with the Japanese government to

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary of Discussion</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> led the
                            discussion. He stated that the Strategic Hamlet Program is sound. It
                            separates the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> from supplies,
                            intelligence information, and from the general population. In the longer
                            term, the program holds out prospects for social and economic changes
                            throughout the country.</p>
                        <p>However, under the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime
                            implementation of the program has been faulty, particularly in the Delta
                            region, primarily due to over-extension. The Strategic Hamlet Program
                            represents a large dollar investment by the U.S. Government and a large
                            labor investment by the Vietnamese people. Minister <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> believes the new government
                            in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> will continue the program since
                            they cannot default on what was promised the people under this program
                            by their predecessors. The Generals will seek to disassociate themselves
                            from past errors by providing for closer military and civil cooperation,
                            reduced forced labor, relocation of poorly placed hamlets and improved
                            training and arming of the militia. Most importantly, they must, sooner
                            or later, establish meaningful priorities. Primary emphasis on hamlets
                            must be in the Delta area and progress reporting should focus on this
                            strategic region as well as on the thirteen critical provinces discussed
                            earlier by General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In the future additional hamlets will be required, maybe as many as one
                            thousand, and some poor hamlets will need relocation. This will be
                            expensive. Seventy percent of the hamlets in the Delta are not up to the
                            standard required to make them truly effective. Economic and political
                            progress must be made to improve the people's standard of living. New
                            educational facilities are required and distribution of fertilizer to
                            the inhabitants of the strategic hamlets is needed. The new government
                            has established an inter-ministerial committee to supervise the
                            Strategic Hamlet Program. Minister <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> stated that as far as the Country Team could
                            determine, the one billion plasters already budgeted by the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> for support of strategic hamlets will
                            cover current costs. No additional <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            funds are foreseen.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked how much
                            medical contact did the people in the hamlets have? He was answered that
                            this varies, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> has one group that
                            dispenses some medical assistance and the U.S. Army has an on-the-job
                            medical training program. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> added that there are only 700 doctors in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, 450 of whom are in the armed
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> asked where
                            does the responsibility for the Strategic Hamlet Program now fall?
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> replied that
                            there was no change on the U.S. side, and that the inter-ministerial
                            committee is responsible on the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>
                            side. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> then asked how do we communicate
                            our recommendations concerning this program to <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0650"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> now that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is dead. Minister <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> replied that we utilize all
                            available means of communication through <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>, etc.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Felt stated we are dealing with development of a new campaign
                            plan with priority emphasized on areas south and southwest of Saigon.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> replied the
                            first priority of effort would be in this part of the country although
                            attention would also be given to the problem areas in the north.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> then asked to
                            whom the province chiefs report. Minister <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> replied that this varies between Corps, but in
                            most cases to Corps Commanders. Admiral Felt then asked if this put the
                            division commanders on the same level as the province chiefs. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> replied in the
                            affirmative, but noted that the division is an operational command
                            subject to movement to any part of the country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> asked how the
                            strategic hamlets are financed. Minister <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> replied that they were originally financed
                            through an emergency purchase of ten million dollars worth of plasters
                            by the U.S. Government. Now they are being financed by the Vietnamese
                            Government, although some $35 million of U.S. assistance has gone into
                            the hamlet program this year. Minister <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> stated that there is an advantage to the
                            village inhabitants contributing reasonable amounts of labor to the
                            hamlets as it serves thereby to identify the peasants with their own
                            hamlets and with the program as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> emphasized that
                            when he said 70% of the hamlets in the Delta were not considered up to
                            standard, he did not mean that they are under <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> control. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked if there are any hamlets under control of
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> responded that although some
                            hamlets have been over-run and some subverted by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, he did not know of any that were
                            actually under the control of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>1. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> presided throughout the meeting.</p>
                        <p>2. Honolulu. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> opened the meeting,
                            commenting that he was very impressed with the idea of traveling by jet
                            to distant places and holding a conference.<note n="2" xml:id="d322fn2">See <ref target="#d321">Document 321</ref>.</note> The fact that he
                            was able to get a good night's sleep before arriving in Honolulu and
                            that the whole trip was so effortless and comfortable made a deep
                            impression on him.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> commented that his overall impressions of the
                            conference itself were diffuse, and that this was probably significant.
                            He then went on to make a few specific points. There is no country team
                            in Vietnam at the present time in any real sense. It is clear that
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> feels he does not
                            have the Ambassador's confidence, and this is affecting US operations in
                            the country. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> is clearly
                            the dominant personality, but it is not at all evident that he can
                            handle the job he is now faced with. He is a strong-willed close
                            operator who keeps only his personal staff involved. This was just the
                            type needed during his first months in Saigon when he was supposed to
                            create a posture which would indicate to any would-be revolutionist that
                            the US would not automatically side with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Now, however, what is needed is a good manager, who can develop a team to
                            do a very complex job. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            apparently has neither the inclination for nor the interest in this type
                            of management task. In short, the course the US country team will chart
                            in Vietnam is by no means decided upon. As for the military side
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> made a passing reference to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>' somewhat shaky
                            performance, and then passed on to say that it was undoubtedly difficult
                            for him to operate under <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>,
                            particularly after <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> from
                            whom there was normally complete backing. Now <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> represents an independent source
                            of power that can not be relied upon to move always in the direction
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> might wish.</p>
                        <p>As to the meetings, <persName>Bundy</persName> said that briefings of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> tend to be sessions
                            where people try to fool him, and he tries to convince them they cannot.
                            As for the military reporting, someone told <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            that for the first time it was realistic about the situation in the
                            Delta. It was uncertain whether the change resulted from the fact that
                            US military now believed they could criticize the Vietnam war effort
                            without fear of criticizing the government itself, or whether it was
                            something more fundamental.</p>
                        <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0652"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> was impressed with the argument by an <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> man that fertilizer could be a big help
                            in winning the war in the Delta. He said that everyone recognized that
                            the strategic hamlets, even though associated with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, had to remain the center of the
                            war effort.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the regime itself <persName>Bundy</persName> said it was too
                            early to see what course it would follow, but it was clear that the
                            coalition of generals might not last. The regime was concentrating on
                            continuing the war and, more important, seems determined to focus on the
                            war in the Delta, thus hitting at the Viet Cong resource base.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was assassinated in
                            Dallas while traveling in an open car from Love Field to the Dallas
                            Trade Mart where he was scheduled to give a speech on national security.
                            The President was taken to Parkland Hospital in Dallas where doctors
                            pronounced him dead at 1 p.m. The prepared text of the speech which

                            Parkland Hospital approximately 20 minutes before the President was

                            Love Field. At 2:38 p.m., a Federal Judge administered the oath of

                            following points:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Need for Teamwork</hi>. It is absolutely vital that
                            the whole of the Country Team, but particularly Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, work in close harmony and
                            with full consultation back and forth. There must be no back-biting or
                            sniping at low levels such as may have contributed to recent news
                            stories about General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            being out of favor with the new regime. A key element in this is the
                            selection of a new deputy to the Ambassador, to replace <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">William Trueheart</persName>. (<persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> has been there more than two
                            years, and the Ambassador agrees that he should now be replaced.) This
                            is for the Secretary of State to work out, but what is needed is a good
                            chief-of-staff type, able to work with the military, economic, and
                            information people, knowing the area, and tough in pulling people
                            together and ironing out any signs of dissension. Two names suggested
                            have been <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">William Sullivan</persName> (he is
                            now Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s assistant

                            the Paris Embassy. In any case, the Ambassador should know that he has
                            your authority to select the best possible man that he and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> can find, and this matter
                            should be worked out before he leaves Washington.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Economic and Budget Problem</hi>. The Honolulu
                            conference highlighted that the new Vietnamese government faces a really
                            serious 1964 budget problem requiring some combination of increased
                            taxes, drawing on foreign exchange reserves, and other austerity
                            measures, perhaps some greater US aid input (though this is tough for
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> in view of Congressional cuts),
                            and a really tight budget. The first step, agreed at Honolulu, is for
                            Mr. Bell to get the strongest possible US team out to discuss these
                            problems with the new government, which is clearly very inexperienced
                            and unsure of its ground. The Ambassador must really get into this
                            problem, as the essence of it is political—whether the new government
                            can take steps that may make sense from an economic standpoint without
                            unduly weakening its political position and stability—which is vital to
                            the war. With the new government just getting on its feet, long-term
                            factors are secondary to the short-term problem of insuring its
                            position.</p>
                        <p>We may well have to accept putting in more aid than we would
                            theoretically like, to ensure the new government's standing, and we
                            should be prepared to direct the necessary funding at whatever cost to
                            other programs in <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> or in the Military
                            Assistance Program. (Incidentally, the overall tightness of funds
                            highlights the importance of holding any further cuts in the total
                            foreign aid bill to an absolute minimum.)</p>

                        <p rend="center">SITUATION IN VIET-NAM</p>
                        <p>As background for your talk with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> the current situation in Viet-Nam is as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Summary Assessment</hi>. The outlook is hopeful. There
                            is better assurance than under <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that the war can be won. We are pulling out 1,000
                            American troops by the end of 1963. The main concern is whether the
                            generals can hold together until victory has been achieved. An immediate
                            problem is an estimated budgetary deficit of roughly $100 million after
                            aid for 1964.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Political</hi>. The new “provisional” government
                            consists of a Military Revolutionary Council, with an Executive
                            Committee of 12 generals headed by General “Big” <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> as President; a Cabinet headed by
                            former Vice President Tho as Premier; and a political advisory body
                            called the “Council of Sages”.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> and Tho, who are old
                            friends, are working well together. Thus far no important signs of
                            friction have developed among the generals. The uncertain element is the
                            ambitious, emotional General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>, who is Minister of Public Security and retains
                            command of the III Corps around Saigon.</p>
                        <p>The new government has the enthusiastic support of the urban population.
                            The peasants remain apathetic as under the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime, but the government recognizes the
                            importance of moving to win their support.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Military</hi>. The Viet Cong incident rate shot up to
                            a new high of about 1,000 per week immediately after the coup, but
                            subsequently resumed to its “normal” level (300-500 per week). The most
                            critical area is the Mekong Delta south and west of Saigon, and it is
                            there that the new government is expected to concentrate its
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>The previously low troop ratio in the Delta is being improved. Officers
                            and NCO's are being chosen on merit rather than political loyalty. The
                            dual chain of command which plagued efficiency under <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has given way to a single chain
                            which will improve coordination of civil and military operations.</p>
                        <p>The government is expected to correct defects in the implementation of
                            the strategic hamlet program, first by establishing a proper system of
                            priorities for hamlet development from more secure toward <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0656"/>less secure areas. Some delay is
                            expected because the government is just establishing a new central
                            organization for the strategic hamlet program, and the new
                            administration will have to shake down at the local level because of
                            changes in province and district chiefs.</p>
                        <p>Early action is needed to push forward with a fresh, realistic amnesty
                            program to attract Viet Cong to surrender. The new government has not
                            yet had a chance to focus on this problem.</p>
                        <p>We are pulling out by the end of 1963 about 1,000 of the 16,500 American
                            military forces in Viet-Nam. This was announced on the conclusion of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> visit in October.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Economic</hi>. The major operational problem we face
                            immediately is how to deal with an estimated 7 billion plaster (roughly
                            $100 million) deficit in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> 1964
                            budget after a United States aid contribution at the 1963 level ($95
                            million in <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> and $30 million in PL
                            480). Unless handled properly, this could prevent the generals from
                            consolidating the new government politically.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was so
                            concerned at Honolulu that he offered, if necessary, to switch some
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds to <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> despite a shortage of $12 million in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> availabilities to meet field
                            requirements. It still remains necessary to conduct a difficult
                            negotiation with the Vietnamese Government to get it to do all it can to
                            meet this budgetary deficit problem.</p>
                        <p>Relations with Foreign Countries. Our own relations with the new
                            government are excellent at all levels. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> would like to avoid putting
                            heavy pressure on the new government over the next few months.</p>
                        <p>Cambodian-Vietnamese relations remain poor. <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> of Cambodia is upset about the activities of
                            Cambodian dissidents in Viet-Nam and Thailand. Viet-Nam is concerned
                            about Viet Cong use of Cambodian territory.</p>
                        <p>The new Vietnamese Government will work well with Phoumi in Laos. We are
                            pressing it to work with <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Souvanna</persName>,
                            too.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s relations with the
                            new government are strained because he considers the coup a set-back to
                            his hopes for neutralizing Viet-Nam.</p>

                            the policy control of the Laos/ North Viet-Nam operations; <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> had no strong opinions on the

                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said he had no opinion but
                            would be willing to receive such a mission if Washington thought it was
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>Relations with Laos and Cambodia, including the Khmer Serei activities,
                            were also discussed. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> is in
                            agreement with our general program.</p>
                        <p>There were no problems of backstopping of the Embassy by Washington.</p>
                        <p>The only administrative matter on which <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> had an opinion was on new plans for the Embassy.
                            He felt that before the new Embassy was built the plans should be
                            reviewed in the light of the experience that we had recently had.
                            Specifically, the Embassy should be designed from a security/defense
                            point of view. The Vietnamese were a violent people and something
                            violent could happen in the future some time. Also, the plans should
                            include a helicopter landing pad.</p>
                        <p>One other administrative matter concerned secure-voice equipment between
                            the residence and the chancery. Such equipment was essential; it had the
                            added advantage of providing a good excuse for an American guard 24
                            hours a day at the residence, which was highly desirable.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said he would look into
                            the controls over air and artillery strikes and the question of an
                            effective amnesty program. In general, however, he did not want to push
                            the military committee around on specific issues, but let them develop
                            in their own way, at least until they had worked out a method of
                            operating and their internal relationships.</p>
                        <p>Also he wants <persName corresp="#p_NDG1">Nes</persName> and cannot
                            understand why any other department or agency of the government should
                            have a voice in the appointment of his DCM.</p>
                        <p>In conversation with <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> agreed that <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Madame Nhu</persName> should not be permitted entry
                            into the United States.</p>
                        <p>On the question of a Navy man at <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            expressed the interesting view that it might be better to have an Army
                            man. Navy matters were routine in the Pacific; the real problem was
                            going to come in any land warfare. In any land fighting the bulk of the
                            troops would have to be Asian; the US should supply only enough men to
                            justify an American as supreme commander. What we need, therefore, is a
                            politically sensitive Army man who would understand the total problem
                            and lay the groundwork for its solution.</p>
                        <p>The matter of Dr. Gard did not come up.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> cited several intelligence
                            reports to indicate that the North Vietnamese might be considering a way
                            out of the war in South Viet-Nam. Further, <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> is convinced that the North Vietnamese want more
                            than anything else to have the American presence removed and he felt
                            that we should exact some quid pro quo for withdrawing American forces
                            rather than handing it to them on a silver platter, as our present plans
                            for withdrawal would do.</p>
                        <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0660"/>
                        <p>What he proposes is a two-pronged approach to North Viet-Nam. The first
                            is a stick: to pass word to the North Vietnamese that the Americans are
                            impatient and are beginning to think of retaliatory action against North
                            Viet-Nam unless they call off the Viet Cong. The second is a carrot:
                            through a separate channel to pass word to the North Vietnamese that the
                            Americans would be willing to withdraw provided they called off the Viet
                            Cong.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> was at pains to point out
                            that this was quite different from <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s proposals for a reunified and neutralized
                            Viet-Nam and also different from the Communist and Cambodian proposal
                            for a neutralized South Viet-Nam. What he proposes is, in fact, the
                            neutralization of North Viet-Nam—that is, make it into a Communist
                            neutral along the lines of Yugoslavia.</p>

                        <p>Regarding NVN, <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s idea was
                            that when <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> had made sufficient
                            progress and clearly had the upper hand, we should first get word to
                            NVN, in the form of a plant, that we planned an air strike if <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> did not stop their support of the
                            Viet-Cong, and then develop some method by which, after they were in a
                            fearful mood, direct contact would be made which would get them to stop
                            support in return for our abandoning plans for striking NVN. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> believes <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> both fears American air attack and having to call on
                            Red China for support, as <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> feels they
                            would never be able to get Red China out.</p>

                        <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> reported that
                            the change in government had been an improvement, that he was hopeful
                            over the outlook, that he expected a speedup of the war, he thought by
                            February or March we would see marked progress. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> stated that we were not involved
                            in the coup, though we put pressures on the South Vietnamese government
                            to change its course and those pressures, most particularly on
                            indications of withdrawal by 1965, encouraged the coup. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> stated that there were
                            indications that North Vietnam might be interested in arrangements which
                            would be of a nature satisfactory to us. He did not elaborate. He
                            thought that everybody was very happy after the coup and showed some
                            pictures of the crowds in Saigon. He mentioned that Gen. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> would be here and that those
                            talking with him should influence him to put on all the pressure he
                            could. He spoke most highly of the Papal delegate and his intention to
                            see the Pope on Wednesday. [<hi rend="italic">1 sentence (2-1/2 lines)
                                not declassified</hi>] <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            said he saw dangers of an anti-Christian move and this was his purpose
                            in seeing the Pope. He made a point that Bishop <persName corresp="#p_THUC1">Thuc</persName> had engaged in serious
                            persecutions involving the imprisonment of a great many people,
                            including three Catholic priests. He also made the point that Can,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s brother, also engaged
                            in a variety of activities of persecution and the execution of
                            individuals and that Can had, on his own premises, a burial ground for
                            his victims. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said that we
                            were in no way responsible for the death of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>,
                            that had they followed his advice, they would be alive today. He said
                            that he saved Can from assassination and that Bishop <persName corresp="#p_THUC1">Thuc</persName> was out of Saigon under orders
                            from the Papal delegate. (<hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: I question
                            whether the Papal delegate can order a Bishop out of a country.) The
                            tone of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s
                            statements were optimistic, hopeful, and left the President with the
                            impression that we are on the road to victory.</p>
                        <p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> stated that
                            our estimate of the situation was somewhat more serious. We had noted a
                            continuing increase in Viet Cong activity since the first of November as
                            evidenced by a larger <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0662"/>number of
                            Viet Cong attacks. We also noticed with considerable concern a high
                            level of message volume on the Viet Cong military and political networks
                            and this might quite possibly reflect preparations for further sustained
                            guerrilla pressures. Furthermore I stated that the military were having
                            considerable trouble in completing the political organization of the
                            government and were receiving little if any help from civilian
                            leadership. Indeed it seemed to us that the competent civilians were
                            staying on the sidelines and continuing their traditional role of
                            critics rather than turning in and being helpful. I concluded by stating
                            that we could not at this point or time give a particularly optimistic
                            appraisal of the future.</p>
                        <p>The President then stated that he approached the situation with some
                            misgivings. He noted that a great many people throughout the country
                            questioned our course of action in supporting the overthrow of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime. He also noted
                            that strong voices in the Congress felt we should get out of Vietnam.
                            Both of these facts give the President considerable concern. He stated
                            that he was not at all sure we took the right course in upsetting the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime but this was a
                            decision that he did not have to make as it was a fait accompli. He said
                            now that it was done, we have to see that our objectives were
                            accomplished. (<hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: The inferences were that,
                            left to his own devices, he would not have supported the courses of
                            action which led to the coup.)</p>
                        <p>The President then stated he has never been happy with our operations in
                            Vietnam. He said there had been serious dissension and divisions within
                            the American community and he told the Ambassador that he was in total
                            charge and he wanted the situation cleaned up. He wanted no more
                            divisions of opinion, no more bickering and any person that did not
                            conform to policy should be removed. At this point Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> stated that we were searching for a
                            replacement for <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> and
                            what we wanted was a capable administrator who could run the Country
                            Team. The President again repeated his insistence that the Ambassador
                            was the Number One man and he, the President, was holding the Ambassador
                            personally responsible.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that he
                            had examined the economic situation and that he felt we must give
                            generously of economic aid and must not ask the South Vietnamese
                            government to do the impossible at this particular time.</p>
                        <p>The President then said that he supported this, but at the same time he
                            wanted to make it abundantly clear that he did not think we had to
                            reform every Asian into our own image. He said that he felt all too
                            often when we engaged in the affairs of a foreign country we wanted to
                            immediately transform that country into our image and this, in his
                            opinion, was a mistake. He was anxious to get along, win the war—he
                            didn't want as much effort placed on so-called social reforms.</p>

                            on social reforms; he has very little tolerance with our spending so

                        <p>The President has reviewed the discussions of South Vietnam which
                            occurred in Honolulu, and has discussed the matter further with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d331fn2">See <ref target="#d330">Document 330</ref>.</note>
                            He directs that the following guidance be issued to all concerned:</p>
                        <p>1. It remains the central object of the United States in South Vietnam to
                            assist the people and Government of that country to win their contest
                            against the externally directed and supported Communist conspiracy. The
                            test of all U.S. decisions and actions in this area should be the
                            effectiveness of their contribution to this purpose.</p>
                        <p>2. The objectives of the United States with respect to the withdrawal of
                            U.S. military personnel remain as stated in the White House statement of
                            October 2, 1963.<note n="3" xml:id="d331fn3">See <ref target="#d170">Document 170</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. It is a major interest of the United States Government that the
                            present provisional government of South Vietnam should be assisted in
                            consolidating itself and in holding and developing increased public
                            support. All U.S. officers should conduct themselves with this objective
                            in view.</p>
                        <p>4. The President expects that all senior officers of the Government will
                            move energetically to insure the full unity of support for established
                            U.S policy in South Vietnam. Both in Washington and in the field, it is
                            essential that the Government be unified. It is of particular importance
                            that express or implied criticism of officers of other branches be
                            scrupulously avoided in all contacts with the Vietnamese Government and
                            with the press. More specifically, the President approves the following
                            lines of action developed in the discussions of the Honolulu meeting of
                            November 20. The offices of the Government to which central
                            responsibility is assigned are indicated in each case.</p>
                        <p>5. We should concentrate our own efforts, and insofar as possible we
                            should persuade the Government of South Vietnam to concentrate its
                            efforts, on the critical situation in the Mekong Delta. This
                            concentration should include not only military but political, economic,
                            social, educational and informational effort. We should seek to turn the
                            tide not only of battle but of belief, and we should seek to increase
                            not only the control of hamlets but the productivity of this area,
                            especially where the proceeds can be held for the advantage of
                            anti-Communist forces.</p>
                        <p>(Action: The whole country team under the direct supervision of the
                            Ambassador.)</p>
                        <p>6. Programs of military and economic assistance should be maintained at
                            such levels that their magnitude and effectiveness in the eyes of the
                            Vietnamese Government do not fall below the levels sustained <pb n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0665"/>by the United States in the time of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government. This does
                            not exclude arrangements for economy on the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> account with respect to accounting for ammunition, or
                            any other readjustments which are possible as between <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and other U.S. defense resources.
                            Special attention should be given to the expansion of the import,
                            distribution, and effective use of fertilizer for the Delta.</p>
                        <p>(Action: <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> as appropriate.)</p>
                        <p>7. Planning should include different levels of possible increased
                            activity, and in each instance there should be estimates of such factors
                            as:</p>
                        <p>A. Resulting damage to North Vietnam;</p>
                        <p>B. The plausibility of denial;</p>
                        <p>C. Possible North Vietnamese retaliation;</p>
                        <p>D. Other international reaction.</p>
                        <p>Plans should be submitted promptly for approval by higher authority.</p>
                        <p>(Action: State, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>8. With respect to Laos, a plan should be developed and submitted for
                            approval by higher authority for military operations up to a line up to
                            50 kilometers inside Laos, together with political plans for minimizing
                            the international hazards of such an enterprise. Since it is agreed that
                            operational responsibility for such undertakings should pass from <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>, this plan should include a redefined method of
                            political guidance for such operations, since their timing and character
                            can have an intimate relation to the fluctuating situation in Laos.</p>
                        <p>(Action: State, DOD, and CIA.)</p>
                        <p>9. It was agreed in Honolulu that the situation in Cambodia is of the
                            first importance for South Vietnam, and it is therefore urgent that we

                            should develop as strong and persuasive a case as possible to
                            demonstrate to the world the degree to which the Viet Cong is
                            controlled, sustained and supplied from Hanoi, through Laos and other

                        <p>874. Following highlights from call on <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> by Tran Chanh Thanh, Vietnamese Ambassador to
                            Tunisia and special representative to <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> funeral ceremonies:</p>
                        <p>1. Assured Thanh that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> not only supports <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> policies toward Viet-Nam, but participated in
                            making them. Will therefore give full support to new government in
                            effective conduct of war.</p>
                        <p>2. Answering Thanh's query re significance US withdrawal 1,000 men from
                                Viet-Nam,<note n="2" xml:id="d332fn2">See <ref target="#d339">Document 339</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said withdrawal
                            psychologically important in showing success, encouraging Vietnamese
                            people by showing they can increasingly take over job, and deflating
                            Communist propaganda about American objectives in Viet-Nam. To further
                            query re withdrawal American forces by end 1965, <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> explained this means only
                            training personnel since Vietnamese expected to be fully trained by
                            then, and we shall keep in Viet-Nam whatever forces are needed for
                            victory. Thanh said there had been erroneous interpretations of
                            withdrawal announcements in Viet-Nam and suggested public clarification
                            along these lines. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> agreed
                            we would find means following through on this suggestion (FYI we expect

                            interpreted as intended to exert pressure on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government and that we should

                        <p>3. Thanh raised Cambodian-Vietnamese relations. Said <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had halted one Khmer Serei station, but
                            broadcasts continuing from units not yet located. Asked whether US would
                            assist in locating if <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> requested, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> replied
                            affirmatively. (Can Saigon confirm that one station eliminated?)</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> affirmed following

                                would support the idea and warned that should the proposal fail, the

                        <p>He also said there should be virtually complete agreement on what

                        </list>
                        <p>1. In the “armed liberation” strategy of both Mao Tse-Tung and <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>, the establishment and
                            gradual extension of “secure” base areas is a primary objective in the
                            struggle. Within such secure areas, the Viet Cong have, since the
                            beginning of resistance against the French in 1945-46, attempted to
                            carry out quasi-governmental functions. Their purpose is two-fold and
                            sometimes contradictory. They seek to win the voluntary support of the
                            population by various activities of a welfare or civic-action nature. By
                            example they try to show that they are more efficient, honest, and
                            humane as administrators than the enemy regime. At the same time, they
                            are concerned with exercising control and extracting support in the form
                            of manpower, food and labor; these requirements frequently take priority
                            and undo any favorable effects from their psychological operations.</p>
                        <p>2. In areas still not “secure” or not under strong Viet Cong influence,
                            the guerrilla forces must live a hit-and-run existence and have little
                            opportunity to act as the effective local administration. In these areas
                            they must nonetheless rely upon support, shelter, and supply <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0669"/>from the civilian populace, which is
                            obtained not only by force but by positive steps to convince the
                            population that its aspirations are those of the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>3. Much of our detailed knowledge with respect to Viet Cong activities in
                            these directions comes from the period of Viet <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> resistance against the French.
                            There is sufficient current reporting, however, to leave little doubt
                            that the same pattern of activity is still being followed.</p>
                        <p>4. Viet <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> documents captured
                            during the Indochina war frequently dealt with a program to raise rural
                            living standards—the “new life” program. Such documents often contained
                            statistics on the establishment of schools, numbers of children and
                            adults in school, medical dispensaries, numbers of trained medical aides
                            and midwives, sanitation efforts including numbers of wells and latrines
                            dug, and food and livestock production. This effort and various other
                            governmental activities were carried out under the authority of
                            Administrative-Resistance Councils set up at the regional, provincial,
                            district, and town levels.</p>
                        <p>5. A similar Viet Cong hierarchy of military, politico-administrative,
                            and Liberation Front Committees now exists in South Vietnam, but Viet
                            Cong troops themselves are frequently the agents of both governmental
                            and civic-action tasks. While force and terrorism remain a major Viet
                            Cong instrument against local officials of the South Vietnamese
                            Government and recalcitrant villagers, recently captured Viet Cong
                            documents clearly show that Viet Cong troops and agents are ordered to
                            provide assistance to peasants and to avoid antagonisms and abuses, such
                            as looting or violation of churches and pagodas.</p>
                        <p>6. A Communist land reform program in South Vietnam, begun by the Viet
                                <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, is still being carried
                            out under the Viet Cong, but some difficulties have been encountered.
                            This is reflected in the attitude of the Liberation Front, which watered
                            down its initial emphasis on land reform, although free and
                            unconditional distribution of land to poor peasants is still a part of
                            its platform. Informants and Viet Cong prisoners indicate that early
                            attempts by the Viet Cong to force “middle-class” peasants to give land
                            to the poor were too harsh, caused peasant disputes and loss of
                            production, and depleted the source of funds available for peasant loans
                            and for support of Viet Cong troops. As a result, there appears to have
                            been some modification of Viet Cong land reform activities to lessen
                            pressure on “middle-class” peasants and encourage higher production.
                            Although there are some references to communal farms, the Viet Cong do
                            not appear to have stressed land collectivization in South Vietnam,
                            where popular reaction to North Vietnam's brutal agrarian reform
                            policies has been adverse.</p>
                        <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0670"/>
                        <p>7. Current reports also indicate that the Viet Cong provide assistance to
                            peasants in land clearance, seed distribution, and harvesting, and in
                            turn persuade or force peasants to store rice in excess of their own
                            needs for the use of guerrilla troops. Controls are apparently imposed
                            in Viet Cong zones to prevent shipments for commercial marketing in
                            Saigon, or to collect taxes on such shipments. The Viet Cong themselves
                            often pay cash or give promissory notes for the food they acquire.</p>
                        <p>8. Little detailed information is available on current Communist health
                            and sanitation activities. Captured Viet Cong doctors or medical
                            personnel indicate that dispensaries for treatment of Viet Cong wounded
                            often are scattered inconspicuously among several peasant homes in a
                            village, and that civilians are treated as facilities and supplies
                            permit. Civilians as well as guerrilla forces are almost certainly
                            instructed in methods of sanitation and disease prevention, but apparent
                            shortages of medical personnel and medicines in some areas suggest that
                            medical care for civilians in Viet Cong-dominated areas may be
                            spotty.</p>
                        <p>9. There are also references to primary and adult education, much of it
                            in the form of indoctrination, and to Viet Cong-run schools operating
                            almost side by side with government schools, under the excuse that
                            peasants lack the necessary documentation required to enter government
                            schools. A Liberation Front broadcast of 19 November 1963 claimed that
                            there were some 1,000 schools with 2 million pupils in “freed areas” of
                            South Vietnam. These figures are doubtless exaggerated, but may be a
                            gauge of a fairly extensive Communist educational effort.</p>
                        <p>10. A standard Viet Cong technique of gaining a foothold among tribal
                            minorities in the highland areas of South Vietnam-where Communist
                            encouragement of tribal autonomy gives them a political appeal-has been
                            to select promising tribesmen, take them to North Vietnam for training
                            in welfare activities as well as for political indoctrination, and
                            return them to tribal villages where their new skills tend to assure
                            them positions of prestige and leadership.</p>
                        <p>11. The Viet Cong also promote cultural activities-heavily flavored with
                            propaganda—through press, radio and film media, as well as live drama
                            and festivals. A student informant reported attending dramatic
                            performances in a Viet Cong-held area, where plays, song, and dances
                            provided entertainment and a dose of propaganda—often enthusiastically
                            received.</p>
                        <p>12. There is little firm information about the Viet Cong effort to
                            develop “combat hamlets.” They appear to exist in areas where control by
                            either side is missing or tenuous, and sometimes are located near
                            government “strategic hamlets.” Reports indicate that, like strategic
                            hamlets, they are fortified externally, and their inhabitants are <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0671"/>carefully trained in defensive
                            procedures and escape routes, often interrelated with other nearby
                            hamlets. Similar defensive systems have long prevailed in Viet
                            Cong-controlled areas, although Viet Cong installations themselves may
                            be innocent looking and easily evacuated buildings or huts.</p>
                        <p>13. A Viet Cong document discussing the successful construction of a
                            “combat hamlet” indicates that primary stress is laid on determining the
                            basic wants and needs of the inhabitants-frequently their concern for
                            their own land. Propaganda is directed at convincing them that the
                            government is threatening their interests, that defensive measures must
                            be taken, and finally that offensive actions against government
                            officials and troops are needed. The peasants presumably come to regard
                            the Viet Cong as their protectors and to cooperate voluntarily with the
                            Viet Cong military effort.</p>

                            30.</p>
                        <p>1. I told him of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s determination to continue U.S. help to V.N.'s
                            struggle for freedom, which he much appreciated.</p>
                        <p>2. He said recent Viet Cong successes, especially the daytime attacks,
                            were due to VC infiltration of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            units, notably of the Special Forces. This had been going on for two
                            years with the connivance of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            who in his last days had appealed directly to the Viet Cong for help. Of
                            this they have proof. Also the Viet Cong had been engaged in selling
                            charcoal to the Government of Viet Nam for a long time.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> was now engaged in
                            cleaning out the infiltrators, getting rid of the politically appointed
                            non-commissioned officers and bringing the capable officers into the key
                            places.</p>
                        <p>4. These recent experiences have taught them that in every case the
                            people have left the bad Strategic Hamlets and have returned to their
                            old homes close to their own fields, but that the people have stayed in
                            the good Strategic Hamlets.</p>
                        <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0672"/>
                        <p>5. The Viet Cong were taking advantage of the change of government to
                            capitalize on all that they had gained under the former regime.</p>
                        <p>6. For the future the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> intended to
                            base themselves on the good Strategic Hamlets. The efforts to construct
                            Strategic Hamlets had been spread much too thin and instead of
                            allocating 20,000 plasters for each Strategic Hamlet he wanted to
                            concentrate a larger sum of money on a few that were really good. He had
                            already spoken to Brent about this.</p>
                        <p>7. He wanted the creation of a U.S. team to work with their teams as a
                            “braintrust”. He realized that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had kept the Americans at arm's length. They,
                            however, had nothing to hide and wanted to have us understand all the
                            details of their operations as much as possible.</p>
                        <p>8. Both he and General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> who was
                            present throughout attached great importance to what they had
                            accomplished with the Hoa Hao's and Cao Dai's. He said there were two
                            million Hoa Hao's. They were rabidly anti-Communist, they knew the
                            country and were a great asset. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had lost them by trying to force them into becoming
                            Christians.</p>
                        <p>9. He said he was still not satisfied with the intelligence he was
                            getting and wanted American help in this regard.</p>
                        <p>10. The number one priority was Saigon, Cholon and the Delta. He wanted
                            to make an “oil spot” type of operation-something which would spread
                            out. They could not be strong everywhere. They would organize this area
                            with three Generals two of whom were General Phat and General Thieu
                            whose power was delegated from that of General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>. The third was General Co. They
                            had complete authority over the province chiefs and district delegates
                            as regards military matters.</p>
                        <p>11. On the matter of Cambodia they wanted us to find out whether the
                            Thais were supporting the Khmer Serei. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> Please advise me.</p>
                        <p>12. Also did any U.S. Government activity of any kind help <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s regime to get the Khmer Serei
                            broadcast started. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> Please
                            advise.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> asked this question: If
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> is proven to be a
                            Communist, will the United States put a nationalist in power in
                            Cambodia? What will the United States do? <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> What, if anything, should I say to this?</p>
                        <p>14. They expect the Laotian Army to send a delegation to visit Viet Nam
                            in the near future and are looking forward to it.</p>
                        <p>15. I again brought up the question of <persName>Ngo Dinh</persName> Can
                            and was told that they had no intention whatever of killing him and I
                            got the distinct impression that if the tribunal should sentence him to
                            death there was a good chance he would get clemency.</p>
                        <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0673"/>
                        <p>16. There was no doubt at all that these men are most eager to get on
                            with the war and intend to leave no stone unturned. But, in order to
                            show our eagerness, I said that I hoped to be in a position on my next
                            trip to the United States to make a public statement on their
                            accomplishments and also to appear before the Senate and House in a
                            position to point to concrete results and not just to talk about
                            intentions and hopes. When General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> asked me when I hoped to do this I set the date
                            ahead about a month of what I really plan and said at the end of
                            January. He and General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>
                            looked at each other but didn't reject that date as impossible so maybe
                            there'll be something by the end of February.</p>

                        <p>1. This is a field appraisal of the current situation. It is not an
                            official judgment by this Agency or any component thereof. It represents
                            the observations and interpretations of a staff officer based on
                            information available to him at the time of its preparation. Prepared
                            for internal use as a guide to the operational environment, this
                            commentary is disseminated in the belief that it may be useful to other
                            agencies in assessing the situation for their own purposes.</p>
                        <p>2. Although the Viet Cong (VC) overall incident rate continued to decline
                            this week, enemy activity remained well above normal levels and included
                            several significant successes. Perhaps the most notable VC success was
                            the apparently unimpeded entry of a 300-man force into the US Special
                            Forces civilian irregular defense training camp at Hiep Hoa, Hau Nghia
                            Province, on 24 November. The circumstances behind this VC victory,
                            which resulted in sizeable casualties (including the presumed capture of
                            four Americans) and weapons losses, are not entirely clear, but there is
                            evidence that security arrangements were <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0674"/>inadequate; betrayal by some of the strike forces
                            elements within the camp itself is also a possibility. The heaviest
                            enemy activity continued to center on the 5th, 7th, and 9th Division
                            areas, but other areas also responded with higher than usual levels of
                            action to obvious Hanoi orders to exert heavy pressure on the new regime
                            before it had adequate time in which to get organized.</p>
                        <p>3. The intensive activity of the VC this month has thus far failed of its
                            apparent purpose of inducing panic in the new regime; nevertheless it
                            has demonstrated a continuing, and in some areas an enhanced, enemy
                            capability for sustaining a high level of activity over a period of time
                            spanning several weeks. Perhaps even more disturbing than the VC's
                            continued offensive abilities is evidence of a growing defensive
                            capability against air-supported assault by government forces. A
                            government operation on 24-25 November in reaction to a VC attack in An
                            Xuyen Province encountered heavy fire from what is believed to have been
                            a VC anti-aircraft company prepositioned in anticipation with the result
                            that a number of aircraft were damaged or destroyed. The anti-aircraft
                            fire also helped prevent the operation, once the troops landed, from
                            developing the momentum necessary to close off the VC defenders' avenues
                            of escape. In another area of the Delta, the government on 24 November
                            captured two US 50 calibre machine guns mounted on anti-aircraft blocks,
                            an anti-aircraft speed sight and a hand-held lead and range estimation
                            device. With the exception of the machine guns, the equipment appears to
                            be of Chinese Communist and/or Russian origin.</p>
                        <p>4. The assassination of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> has evoked strong emotions of sympathy in South
                            Vietnam, the open articulation of which has undoubtedly been facilitated
                            by the new atmosphere of greater friendship which has to date marked the
                            post-coup period. In addition to an impressive memorial march by high
                            school and university students on 25 November, memorial services at the
                            Cathedral and at Xa Loi have been held in the presence of
                            representatives of the Military Executive Council (MEC)—including Major
                            General Duong Van Minh—and of the provisional government. The Saigon
                            press, both vernacular and foreign language, has been full of
                            expressions of sympathy and of confidence that the American-Vietnamese
                            relationship will continue close under President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_MEC1">MEC</gloss> Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> on 23 November signed a decree
                            fixing the statute of the Consultative Council of Sages. The new council
                            will consist of from “40 to 80 members selected from circles
                            representing all nationalist tendencies and walks of life,” who will
                            participate at the invitation of General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>. One feature of the statute which is not likely to
                            sit well with some political leaders is the powers given to Nguyen Ngoc
                            Tho, in his capacity as Prime Minister, in relation to the council's
                            work. Several politicians had previously complained in private <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0675"/>that Tho was maneuvering to
                            give his mostly southern associates disproportionate representation in
                            the projected council. The membership of the new council does not appear
                            to have been finally decided; there is one report that the Generals have
                            rejected a proposed first list sent up to the MEC, presumably by Tho.
                            Several prominent nationalist politicians, meanwhile, appear to question
                            the realism of the suggestion made by some advisors of the <gloss target="#t_MEC1">MEC</gloss> that a two party system be established
                            in South Vietnam; a position which would seem to receive considerable
                            support from the fact that some seventeen groups have already applied to
                            the <gloss target="#t_MEC1">MEC</gloss> for permission to form
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>6. In this initial post-coup shakedown period, it is difficult to trace
                            out the lines of policy implementation within the MRC. Although the
                            triumvirate of <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> and Major
                            Generals <persName corresp="#p_LVKBG1">Le Van Kim</persName> and
                                <persName>Tran Van</persName>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> appears to exercise overall
                            control and is the source of most of the policy guidance, the inner
                            workings, both vertically and horizontally, of the <gloss target="#t_MEC1">MEC</gloss> below this level remain obscure,
                            especially in question of the degree to which the <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> combine
                            is privy of and controls the day to day activities of the other Generals
                            in their respective spheres of responsibility. Slippage between the
                            generally well intended policy lines laid down by the <gloss target="#t_MEC1">MEC</gloss> leaders and actual implementation seems
                            the greatest in connection with the handling of police affairs by Maj.
                            Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MHXBG1">Mai Huu Xuan</persName>, who
                            continues to pack the Directorate-General and police with old cronies,
                            some of whom are of questionable repute, and to pursue with perhaps
                            greater than necessary zeal the roundup for questioning of officials
                            connected with the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime.
                            In the Ministry of Information, Brig. Gen. Tran Tu Oai is taking a
                            considerably less liberal view of freedom of the press than that
                            apparently held by <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> and his
                            immediate associates, reportedly having outlined to editors a fairly
                            extensive list of taboo subjects.</p>

                            first-class Deputy Chief of Mission for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. I count on having your

                            standard I am hoping to set, let me say to you privately that I have

                        <p>Dear Bob: We were intrigued, in your interesting memorandum of a

                            under which <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> would be
                            President of reunified Viet-Nam, and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> Vice President. Both for the historical record and

                        <p>On December 2, 1963, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> made the following announcement:</p>
                        <p>“On December 3 the first increment of approximately 300 U.S. military
                            personnel will be withdrawn from the Republic of Vietnam. They will be
                            followed during the next two or three weeks by another 700, making a
                            total reduction in force of 1000 before the end of 1963.</p>
                        <p>“The fact that this reduction can be made at this time reflects much
                            credit on both the American Advisory and Support personnel and their
                            Vietnamese counterparts who have assimilated knowledge and techniques in
                            a most commendable manner. The training of Vietnamese personnel has
                            progressed to the point where the withdrawal of some US forces is
                            possible.”</p>

                        <p>1. At a meeting of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and SecDef the
                            following conclusions were reached from the evidence available here
                            concerning the military situation in South Vietnam. Your comments are
                            requested: </p>
                        <p>a. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> desires to respond to US
                            advice and to improve its operational effectiveness. It has the
                            capability to do so and its plans are basically sound, but it is in a
                            state of orRanizationa1 turmoil.</p>
                        <p>b. The VC are making an intensive effort to increase their hold on the
                            countryside while the new government is shaking down.</p>
                        <p>c. The VC have exhibited a powerful capability for at least a brief
                            period of intensified operations, and their skill in counter-airborne
                            operations is improving.</p>
                        <p>d. There is ground for concern that infiltration of materiel has
                            increased, but little hard proof. This is a prime intelligence
                            deficiency. It affects not only military tactics but our over-all
                            Southeast Asia strategy.</p>
                        <p>2. If these conclusions are valid they generate several questions:</p>
                        <p>a. What specifically is being done to increase the intensity of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> offensive activity to the 20 day per
                            month level contemplated in the National Campaign Plan? What are the
                            prospects?</p>
                        <p>b. What specific steps are being taken to enhance the quality,
                            effectiveness and number of the paramilitary forces in the critical
                            Delta area? What is the progress?</p>
                        <p>c. Is there reason to be apprehensive that the junta is not able to
                            control General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>? One report
                            is that he blocked the proposed corps command shift. Should the junta be
                            urged to take action against him?</p>
                        <p>d. What more can be done—in Vietnam, Washington or elsewhere—to give a
                            clearer and more substantial picture of the infiltration situation?</p>

                                neutrality. Generally the Department favored the proposal.
                                (Ibid.)</note> I am unable to predict new GVN's reaction to specific
                            Cambodian neutrality proposal. But when I saw General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> on Saturday, they asked the US to
                            say what our attitude would be if it were definitely proven that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> was, in fact, in the
                            ChiCom camp (see my 1093).<note n="3" xml:id="d341fn3">
                                <ref target="#d334">Document 334</ref>.</note> They also asked
                            specifically whether we would try and remove <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> and put in a “nationalist” Chief of State. They
                            also stressed the fact that if Cambodia were truly neutral, with the
                            result that the frontier would be truly sealed off, the war against the
                            Viet Cong would be immensely helped.</p>
                        <p>In view of this very forthright expression of their position, I wonder
                            whether the Department wants me to go back to them at this time.
                            Certainly, before I do so, I need further clarification. While I see the
                            merit of some of the arguments advanced in Deptel 884, it seems to me
                            that the instruction glosses over some fundamental points.</p>
                        <p>The basic point about the Cambodian proposal is that it is not aimed at
                            Communist encroachment in Southeast Asia but rather at giving <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> international assurances
                            against encroachment by Vietnam and Thailand. (The United States is now
                            also accused and, as I note that we are not prepared to participate in a
                            conference so long as the Cambodian charges stand, it would not be
                            surprising if Vietnam and Thailand should take a similar stance.)</p>
                        <p>Given the fact that <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s
                            proposal is clearly and openly aimed at his neighbors, it follows that
                            he will not be satisfied unless we and the other Geneva powers give him
                            some kind of assurance against what he seems to be really afraid of:
                            Vietnamese and/or Thai aggression. Unfortunately, in Vietnamese eyes,
                            this would appear to be siding with a country fully prepared to
                            collaborate with the Communists against a country engaged in a bitter
                            armed struggle against Communist aggression.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, if we fall in with <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s proposal in the face of patent blackmail, we
                            shall do ourselves incalculable damage in this country and, I should
                            think, in other Far East countries which are <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0681"/>stoutly anti-Communist. If we put <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> in a position to involve us in
                            consultations with Communist powers regarding alleged threats to
                            Cambodian neutrality and territorial integrity on the part of
                            anti-Communist countries in the area—and I do not think we could
                            realistically expect to leave the conference table having conceded less
                            than this—we shall undermine the confidence of the new Vietnamese
                            leadership in the firmness of our purpose here and play into the hands
                            of the advocates of neutralism for South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I think that rather than improving the chances of bilateral
                            cooperation between Cambodia and Vietnam—which holds out our best chance
                            for sealing the border—<persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s
                            conference proposal would have the reverse effect. So long as <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> thinks that there is a chance
                            of sheltering under a big power umbrella and blackmailing us regularly,
                            he is not likely to come to terms bilaterally with his neighbors. This
                            may be, incidentally, one reason why he has deliberately failed to take
                            advantage of the improved attitude of Vietnam toward Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>As for the ICC, given its composition and its dependence on Cambodian
                            cooperation for its effectiveness, I do not think that we could
                            realistically expect it to seal off the border. On past performance,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> would wish to use it
                            only to verify Vietnamese encroachments and the Poles could be counted
                            on to see that it was not used in such a way as to interfere seriously
                            with Viet Cong activities.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate the Department's comments on the above. I realize the
                            pressures that are on us to participate in the conference and the risk
                            that, if we do not, <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> may
                            make further irrational moves, including calling in the Chinese
                            Communists. The latter would evidently confront us with grave decisions.
                            It is a risk, however, which seems to me worth taking rather than
                            accepting the near certainty of a serious deterioration of our position
                            in South Vietnam if we yield to <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s blackmail. We are also under pressure from
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and we have an overriding
                            interest in keeping their morale high in view of the major military
                            effort we are rightly demanding of them.</p>

                            very well and believe he can be trusted. He is also an extremely precise

                            shadings. This is something for you to consider. I realize you may have

                            White House on October 2,<note n="5" xml:id="d342fn5">See <ref target="#d170">Document 170</ref>.</note> that the U.S. could
                            complete the major part of <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0683"/>its
                            task in South Viet-Nam (SVN) by 1965, with the implication that
                            withdrawal of most U.S. military personnel would then be possible, could
                            create an opportunity for a U.S. demarche toward North Viet-Nam
                            (NVN).</p>
                        <p>2. This paper seeks to describe this opportunity. It therefore does not
                            consider the merits of the question of whether or not the U.S. should
                            withdraw by 1965. And, it certainly does not foreclose our right not to
                            withdraw if this seems like the prudent course to follow at the
                            time.</p>
                        <p>3. There are straws in the wind which indicate that there is an
                            off-chance that the present may be a favorable moment for such a
                            demarche. One is the apprehension in NVN, so frequently reported,
                            concerning an increase in ChiCom influence because of the Sino-Soviet
                            split. Another is the acute food shortage. Still another would be found
                            in [<hi rend="italic">document number not declassified</hi>],<note n="6" xml:id="d342fn6">Not found.</note> if true, regarding the departure
                            of Soviet technicians. Finally, there is a remark made by the North
                            Viet-Nam Ambassador to Laos on September 16 to <gloss target="#t_UPI1">UPI</gloss> reporter Ray Herndon. After Herndon had asked the
                            Ambassador whether <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> would be
                            interested in negotiating with SVN, the latter is reported to have
                            replied: “Why deal with the son when we can deal with the father?” (The
                            “son” being <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and the “father” being
                            the U.S.)</p>
                        <p>4. What follows is also not a scheme to unify North and South Viet-Nam;
                            it is still less a scheme to neutralize South Viet-Nam. On the contrary,
                            it aims at a ChiCom rollback; it is a move towards neutralizing <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> alone; it should tend to strengthen the
                            anti-Communist position in SVN; it seeks to contend with the Communists
                            over what they (the Communists) have rather than contending with them
                            over what we have.</p>
                        <p>5. Now for the proposal itself. If, pursuant to the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> announcement, we undertake a definitive
                            withdrawal of U.S. troops from Viet-Nam, to be completed by a certain
                            date, we will be doing something which <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> strongly desires. We should, therefore, seek maximum
                            leverage from such withdrawal and use it to put pressure on and to
                            obtain concessions from NVN. Available information indicates <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> strongly desires U.S. troop
                            withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>6. They should, therefore, be made to pay for it and not give it to them
                            for nothing. One concession we should insist on would be cessation of
                            support for Viet Cong and Pathet Lao. (I doubt that they could bring
                            about a VC cease fire, even if they tried—unless it was a mutual cease
                            fire, involving both VC and GVN.)</p>
                        <p>7. I do not visualize a neutralized and united Viet-Nam; on the contrary,
                            I look for a militantly anti-Communist <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> with a Yugoslavia-like neutralist nation to the north.
                            I do not propose a negotiation; I <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0684"/>propose that they be told: U.S. would like to unload—if
                            terms were right-perhaps leave some economic aid, but withdraw troops,
                            provided <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> stops supplying Viet Cong
                            and Pathet Lao and tries for a cease fire. A long-term food agreement
                            might be possible.</p>
                        <p>From another quarter they could be told that if they don't stop aid to VC
                            and PL, they will suffer.</p>
                        <p>One example of what we might hope for from such a demarche would be
                            sealed borders into Laos and South Viet-Nam in the manner of the
                            Greek-Yugoslav border at the time of the civil war there. Surely this
                            would make our work in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> very much
                            more manageable.</p>
                        <p>8. As a carrot to NVN, substantial offers of food support, both from the
                            U.S. and SVN, might be tendered. As a stick, <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> could be informed that American patience with their
                            continued support of VC and Pathet Lao is wearing thin and that their
                            supply bases supporting Communist efforts in Laos and <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> may not be indefinitely permitted to
                            operate from the sanctuary of NVN. Perhaps this point would be made
                            believable if <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> were one night to
                            destroy one <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> supply depot. Others
                            better informed than I must estimate risk which this action would incur
                            of bringing more ChiCom influence into <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> than is there already.</p>
                        <p>9. Other thoughts on the matter: The neutralization of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> might be attractive to the Soviet
                            Union, as counterbalancing the ChiCom influence in Albania. Our
                            reputation among Communists for impatience and impulsiveness might make
                            our proposal plausible to a North Viet-Nam official who is looking for
                            something with which to counter ChiCom hegemony. Also, <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> has a unique prestige and
                            may be one of the few who could pull off such a change of course.
                            Perhaps we should hurry up and try to use him while he is still around.
                            The report from French Delegate General at Hanoi (Paris No. 55, November

                                and in that case <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would show

                        <p>10. Is it not doubtful that <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> can ever
                            know true peace and tranquillity without neutralization of NVN? And if
                            NVN, thinking that they are winning in SVN, rejects what is here
                            proposed, what have we <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0685"/>lost? We
                            will not, in case these ideas lead to nothing, have in any way

                            paras of Ref A.</p>
                        <p>1.a. Concur. It is view of Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>
                            it will be another month before organizational turmoil subsides and
                            modification basic plans effected. I am inclined to agree.</p>
                        <p>1.b. Concur. VC are expending every effort to capitalize on turmoil
                            resultant from coup. They have been effective in attaining this
                            objective however definite reduction in their activity can be noted in
                            the last week. VC incidents this week dropped to 518 from 666 and
                            attacks dropped to 84 from 106.</p>
                        <p>1.c. Concur in part. VC have demonstrated capability at least for brief
                            period of making intensified effort. Intensity of operations has
                            resulted in some gains in some areas of the country side. Reports from
                            corps area yesterday indicate no strat hamlet occupied or attacked by VC
                            during post coup. Intensified opns continue under VC control in I, II
                            and IV Corps. In III Corps 8 strat hamlets in Kien Tuong Prov recently
                            occupied by VC remain under their control. Consider also that possibly
                            all of anti <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> activity may not
                            properly be attributed to VC. At least some of past activity may be
                            result of activity of dissident elements. Concur VC have improved skill
                            in counter-airborne operations basically because of more targets, better
                            weapons, and intensified training.</p>
                        <p>1.d. Share your concern that infiltration of materiel has increased. This
                            is not situation which can be classified as post coup as indicators this
                            regard have been apparent for some time. Have hard proof of increase in
                            this area and while it not overly alarming as to intensity it is
                            significant. Agree that it has effect not only on military tactics but
                                <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0686"/>also on our over-all SE
                            Asia strategy. Recent study prepared this subject and submitted to
                            Ambassador for transmittal to Sec State.<note n="3" xml:id="d343fn3">Not

                        <p>2.a. To date little has been accomplished toward increasing the intensity
                            of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> offensive activity to the
                            statistical 20 day per month level. The drop in intensity which occurred
                            in immediate post coup period has been substantially restored; however,
                            anticipated increase in intensity has not as yet been realized. Believe
                            note should be taken here that statistical level of operational
                            intensity is not necessarily the best indicator of operational
                            effectiveness. The development and execution of comprehensive opnl plans
                            and the freeing of elements tied to static defensive positions has
                            commanded the principal attention of the senior comdrs. Avowed aims of
                                <gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss> are qualitative improvement and
                            intensification of opns. Believe prospects are good for ultimate
                            realization these objectives; however, as indicated in para 1.a. above
                            Gen <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> holds view that another

                            of basic plan nearing completion.</p>
                        <p>2.b. In the 7th, 9th and 21st Division areas the following steps have
                            been accomplished or are planned to improve para-military forces:</p>
                        <p>(1) The elimination of small outposts and watchtowers is proceeding apace
                            under leadership of Gen Co, and until yesterday Col Dong of 7th. Co's
                            basic plan is to move the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> from
                            outposts into hamlets depriving VC of lucrative targets and providing
                            interim defense of hamlets without militia. CG freed from outposts will
                            be formed into mobile units.</p>
                        <p>(2) Senior comdrs in Delta realize that CG and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> units which have been on static defense missions must
                            be retrained. Facilities for such retraining exist and it is being
                            programmed.</p>
                        <p>(3) Very little training and arming of hamlet militia has been
                            accomplished since 1 Nov due reevaluation entire program and wholesale
                            changes in province chiefs. Prospects for progress in the positioning of
                            effective defenders for hamlets is good.</p>
                        <p>(4) <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> is ready to inaugurate an eight
                            week training course for militia squad leaders. Program to start soon as
                            criteria for selection of the leaders is agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>(5) As reported separately<note n="4" xml:id="d343fn4">Not found.</note>
                            <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is conducting negotiations with Hoa
                            Hao who extend through central Delta. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> hope is that Hoa Hao will extend ranks of the CG, SDC,
                            border surveillance units and contribute more effective hamlet militia.
                            Gen <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> feels that Hoa Hao SF
                            units can be utilized in Camau Peninsula.</p>
                        <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0687"/>
                        <p>(6) <gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss> also entertain hopes of rallying
                            Catholics and Cao Dai in Kien Hoa, many of whom live beyond trace of
                            strategic hamlets. Concept is to arm those who are willing to defend
                            their communities against VC.</p>
                        <p>2.c. While there is no doubt in my mind that the junta as a group are
                            keeping their eyes on Gen <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>
                            to insure that he does not get out of line, I do not subscribe to the
                            rumor or supposition that they are unable to control him. Report you
                            cite that he blocked the proposed corps command shift while fairly
                            widely quoted has to my knowledge no valid basis and at this point can
                            only be classified as supposition. Do not believe we should interpose at
                            this time to encourage junta to take action against <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>. Do feel that his dual
                            responsibilities as III Corps Comdr and Minister of Security are too
                            much for one man and have and will continue to suggest that he be
                            relieved of his responsibilities as III Corps Comdr so that his full
                            efforts may be devoted to his ministerial responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>2.d. In-country efforts toward giving a clearer and more substantial
                            picture of the infiltration situation encompass better utilization and
                            control of border surveillance, mountain scout, strike force and other
                            elements. Believe progress in this area underway incident to
                            consolidation of former <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> supported
                            elements under <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> and delegation by
                                <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> of control all such elements to
                            corps comdrs.</p>
                        <p>Significant requirement this regard is lifting of current restrictions on
                            cross border aerial photo recce either by in-country or other aircraft
                            to include Cambodia, Laos, and DRV. Lifting of restrictions on use of US
                            personnel in cross border collection operations would help. More direct

                            about the proposed conference on Cambodia, as described <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0688"/>in Dept's telegrams, the more
                            disastrous I think it would be to the war to help the Republic of
                            Viet-Nam to win and then maintain its independence from Communist
                            aggression. I say this for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>1. It is inconceivable to me that a conference like this could do other
                            than foment and encourage the neutralism which is always present in
                            varying degrees here in South Viet-Nam. People here will say: “First
                            there was Laos; now there is Cambodia; tomorrow it will be Viet-Nam.”
                            Obviously, any encouragement of neutralism must impair the war
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>2. If this conference is held, it will be impossible to avoid
                            consideration of all the Southeast Asian questions, including
                            particularly the unification of North and South Viet-Nam. I recognize
                            the wise desire expressed in Deptel to limit conference scope but doubt
                            whether it can be done. And this emphatically is not the time even to
                            discuss the question of unifying North and South Viet-Nam. The present
                            is the time to strengthen the anti-Communist free world character of
                            South Viet-Nam and to seek to detach, as best we can, North Viet-Nam
                            from Communist China—somewhat as Yugoslavia was detached from the Soviet
                            Union. I admit that Yugoslavia was in a better position to be detached
                            than North Viet-Nam is, but this is nonetheless the direction in which
                            we ought to work now—if only as a preparatory stage to something else.
                            It would be most imprudent to consider the unification of North and
                            South Viet-Nam until South Viet-Nam is in a position of superior
                            strength at the conference table and obviously this state of affairs is
                            not now even in sight.</p>
                        <p>3. The French will be present at the Cambodian conference and this will
                            naturally put them in a position to hamper all of our major policy
                            objectives here which, without a conference, they could not do since
                            they have put no money and no men into the game and are totally without
                            chips. Why we should hand them this juicy favor by putting them into the
                            game I do not see, particularly in light of the fact, as Dept recognized
                            in Deptel 800,<note n="3" xml:id="d344fn3">In telegram 800 to Paris,

                        <p>4. An agreement to protect South Viet-Nam's neutralists from infiltration
                            from Cambodia which was actually enforced by an efficacious border
                            Patrol would have merit, but I have seen no serious <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0689"/>suggestion that there is even a
                            possibility of this. If there were a possibility of it, a conference
                            would probably not be necessary to bring it about.</p>
                        <p>5. I am sure the ChiComs support conference as a step toward helping the
                            Viet Cong in South Viet-Nam, even though I realize praiseworthy motives
                            of conference advocates. </p>
                        <p>6. We should not go into a conference without being clear in our minds as
                            to how we are most likely to come out of it. We should make up our minds
                            what, as an absolute minimum, we must gain from the conference and what,
                            as an absolute minimum, we must avoid. We should then see how many
                            conferees we can count on. All these calculations should precede a
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>7. Giving our opponents (i.e., ChiComs, et al) an opportunity to open up
                            an attack on our ally (South Viet-Nam) does not seem like a good way to
                            get on with the war.</p>
                        <p>8. I dislike differing with conference advocates in U.S. Govt for whom I
                            have such a high regard and with whom I usually agree. I recognize there
                            may be things I do not know. But the above is how it looks to me here in
                            Saigon.</p>
                        <p>9. It looks as though we were at last getting into a good posture here to
                            get some really solid success in the prosecution of the war. We and the
                            Vietnamese have put both blood and treasure into it. Our joint effort
                            here deserves every chance of success.</p>

                        <p>1. I have reviewed ref A and am in general agreement. In certain areas,
                            and para 1 a is a prime example, it is impossible to make an expert
                            judgment at this time.</p>
                        <p>2. I believe Viet Cong has focus on GVN's state of organizational turmoil
                            and will strive to utmost to exploit the circumstance to its advantage.
                            First, Viet Cong is likely to maintain a high level of armed attacks so
                            as to militarily discredit GVN. Second, there could be attempts by VC,
                            using its own as well as “front elements,” to provoke mass agitation. VC
                            goal would be to generate agitation beyond manageable proportions by
                            present government, thus forcing it to take repressive measures to
                            restore order. Politically VC can be expected to try to create
                            situations which will thrust serious challenges before new government
                            while at the same time putting military pressure on it.</p>
                        <p>3. Militarily, VC antiaircraft firepower is growing.</p>
                        <p>4. A major problem before <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is to
                            reduce flow of VC materiel coming in from out of country sources. Assets
                            listed in para 2d of ref A have had limited success in North but have
                            been ineffectual in South. More strict control of Mekong and other
                            waterways should be a priority objective. In view of present
                            difficulties with Cambodia, there is no prospect of achieving control
                            through political means and Cambodian/RVN cooperation. VC materiel
                            infiltration by <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> into Cau Mau
                            Peninsula deserves further attention.</p>
                        <p>5. In respect to border surveillance command and control consolidation
                            under corps commands, two considerations apply:</p>
                        <p>a. Where there are <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units operating
                            with <gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss> units in an area on a regular
                            basis, control should rest with the corps commander.</p>
                        <p>b. Where <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units are not operating
                            with <gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss> on a regular basis, following
                            should be considered:</p>
                        <p>(1) Central operational control by special operational group (<gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>, JGS, CAS) from Saigon.</p>
                        <p>(2) Provision for lateral liaison by <gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> (P)V at corps
                            level for emergency assistance, logistics support, or coordinated
                            operations to include relief operations and air strikes.</p>
                        <p>c. In both a and b situations provision should be made for rapid
                            transmission of <gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss> intelligence to
                            corps commanders to enable them to take rapid action against VC whenever
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> reports on the Laos/RVN cross
                            border patrols have not contained much info on locations of VC crossing
                            points or any evidence of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> support
                            sites in Laos. I would attribute most of this failure to secure results
                            to a lack of aggressiveness on the part of the patrol leaders. US
                            advisors should be permitted to accompany the patrols for a certain
                            distance into Laos and without continuous referral for approval to
                            higher headquarters. Cross border patrols can only carry so much weight
                            through the difficult terrain. If they are to make penetrations to
                            adequate depths and to remain on site for observation <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0691"/>purposes, they need to be resupplied by
                            air. Walking around that part of the world takes time and observation
                            can be extremely limited. We need tactical air recce to locate the most
                            likely areas of VC activity that can then be thoroughly checked out and
                            interdicted by ground units. Cold Tale photography of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Laos are being run regularly. This
                            photography and Able Mable photos of Laos give acceptable coverage of
                            static installations and LOCs and are usable for planning operations.
                            Wash DC restrictions prevent current use of US A/C for low-level
                            time-sensitive tactical photography. Requirements for coverage of
                            Cambodia can be included in Cold Tale missions.</p>

                            protection and to introduce civic action programs.</p>
                        <p>Numerous <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> actions have been taken
                            designed to increase agricultural production in the Delta. These include
                            an offer to finance a massive grant distribution of fertilizer, expanded

                            Congressional appropriations, the United States will maintain the level
                            of aid provided in FY'63 to the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government. Through the newly established Joint
                            Committee on Economic Policy negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> have begun on desirable changes in
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> economic policies, and is using
                            the leverage of commercial import financing to bring about these
                            changes. [sic] Specifically, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> has
                            proposed to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> a program of tax
                            reform and enforcement, the draw-down of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> exchange reserves up to $25 million a year, elimination
                            of luxury imports, and measures to increase exports.</p>
                        <p>The Joint Staff has undertaken to determine the feasibility of
                            establishing required reserve stocks of ammunition in Viet-Nam as
                            US-owned stocks. The Director of Military Assistance is reviewing what
                            immediate action can be taken in the interim period to establish US
                            ammunition stocks in Viet-Nam. Additionally a study is underway to
                            determine if economics can be made in the helicopter program as between
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and service requirements. It has
                            been determined that <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> has
                            authority to provide <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces
                            serviceable, but not necessarily new materiels, and this should result
                            in a reduction of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> costs.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph 7. A joint CIA-Defense plan for intensified operations against
                            North Viet-Nam, providing for selective actions of graduated scope and
                            intensity, is being prepared in Saigon and is due in Washington by
                            December 20.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Paragraph</hi> 8. It has been agreed between the
                            Department of Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> that
                            responsibility for support of paramilitary operations into southern Laos
                            would pass from <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>. With this action a problem in the
                            policy control and clearance of such politically <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0694"/>sensitive operations clearly arises.
                            What we do within Laos by such means can effect the viability of
                                <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>'s delicately
                            balanced government in Laos as well as, less directly, the strength of
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s suspicions of US
                            machinations near his borders.</p>
                        <p>The Country Team in Saigon has suggested that the following arrangement
                            would protect US interests in the matter:</p>
                        <p>A. Establish a zone extending up to 50 kilometers into Laos from the
                            border in which operations could be run without individual
                            clearance.</p>
                        <p>B. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> would undertake to inform
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> fully on plans
                            and operations within this zone so that Ambassador Unger in Vientiane
                            and the Department of State could be kept current on these
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>C. Plans for operations outside the specified zone would require
                            Washington clearance through both State and military channels.</p>
                        <p>This arrangement is acceptable to the Department of Defense and to the
                            Central Intelligence Agency. Relevant suggestions by General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> include the desirability of
                            cross-border aerial reconnaissance of Laos (as well as Cambodia and
                            North Viet-Nam) and the use of US personnel in cross-border intelligence
                            collection operations. These suggestions are endorsed by Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State, recognizing the importance of obtaining all
                            possible intelligence on Viet <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> infiltration routes through Laos, endorses the
                            principle of a controlled increase in cross-border operations into Laos.
                            However, it is unable to accept the Saigon Country Team recommendation
                            on the ground that this fails to provide the close and continuing
                            political guidance and clearance essential to all such operations if the
                            broader interests of the US are to be protected. For this purpose not
                            even the joint approval of the Ambassadors in Saigon and Vientiane is
                            adequate; the broad overview available only in Washington is mandatory.
                            The Department of State, therefore, recommends:</p>
                        <p>A. All cross-border operations into Laos be dependent upon clearance by
                            the Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs, Department of
                            State.</p>
                        <p>B. This clearance can be achieved by:</p>
                        <p>(1) Establishing a coordinating group in Saigon headed by an Embassy
                            political officer (<gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>) assisted by
                            one American and one Vietnamese Special Forces adviser.</p>
                        <p>(2) Developing joint US-Vietnamese cross-border plans by a joint border
                            operations center established under respective US and Vietnamese Special
                            Forces command.</p>
                        <p>(3) Plans would be submitted to the <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss> who would clear in the field with the US Embassies in
                            Saigon and Vientiane and get final clearance from Washington.</p>

                            been greatly reduced by <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s request for termination of US aid and by his
                            continued charges of US complicity in Khmer Serei activities. Efforts to
                            locate the Khmer Serei transmitters have not yet been conclusive, but
                            they continue. [<hi rend="italic">1 sentence (2 lines) not
                                declassified</hi>] Meanwhile, the Cambodians have apparently adopted
                            a less arbitrary attitude toward our aid termination. We have instructed
                            our Ambassador to be forthcoming to the extent Cambodian intentions are
                            sincere and in conformity with our legal requirements and our dignity.
                            The situation has been further complicated by <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s call for an international
                            conference to guarantee his neutrality. His proposal is directed at
                            Viet-Nam and Thailand and has rendered the chances of Vietnamese
                            initiative to improve relations with Cambodia almost nil. We are now
                            consulting with our allies to help us determine what our response to

                            accusations against the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and

                            have reduced hopes for improvement almost to the vanishing point. The
                            outlook is further clouded by <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s demand for Cambodian neutrality being
                            internationally guaranteed through a conference of the Geneva Powers.

                            the Viet Cong make use of Cambodia both as refuge and infiltration route

                            if accepted they would result in demonstrable improvement in relations
                            and if refused would put <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>
                            on the spot as being the one who rejected generous and practical offers
                            of reconciliation, thus indicating he really did not desire normal
                            relations. Silencing of the Khmer Serei radio and cessation of any
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> support therefore is an obvious

                            internal matters should take precedence and the reported visit of

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations:</p>
                        <p>1) That the National Security Agency be requested to adjust its

                            Washington and Viet-Nam, as required to break Viet Cong communication
                            codes.</p>
                        <p>2) That Embassies Saigon, Phnom Penh and Vientiane be directed to develop
                            a combined intelligence acquisition plan designed to produce reliable
                            and timely information concerning the Viet Cong use of the territory of
                            Cambodia and Laos. A directed [direct] feature of this plan should be to
                            assign Embassy Saigon overall responsibility for the coordination of
                            U.S. agency efforts in this regard.</p>
                        <p>3) That the U.S. agencies in Saigon, in coordination with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, develop improved prisoner
                            interrogation procedures to produce a rapid and voluminous flow of
                            intelligence on Viet Cong infiltration and on local recruitment in South
                            Viet-Nam (including numbers and motivation).</p>

                            useful overt information, the Country Team should communicate
                            requirements on a continuing basis to all operating staff, and impress
                            them with the need for greater reporting consciousness.</p>
                        <p>5) To coordinate the covert and overt collection processes, the
                            Ambassador may wish to appoint a senior official full time for this

                            improvement in the Vietnamese military posture and the newly evident
                            inclination of the Vietnamese to respond more effectively to U.S.
                            military advice, operational, training and conceptual deficiencies still
                            exist.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations:</p>
                        <p>1) Combat troops should be employed to their maximum capacity in the
                            performance of combat missions. The average <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> AF Battalion (130 total) is engaged in combat missions
                            on 10-15 days of each month. Our objective is 20 days per month of
                            effective operations for all combat forces.</p>
                        <p>2) The numerous under-manned and non-effective outposts in remote areas
                            are a drain on available military manpower and constitute vulnerable
                            targets for Viet Cong attack. Action to disband unneeded posts and
                            consolidate others in larger and more effective installations is now
                            under way. It must be accelerated.</p>
                        <p>3) The Vietnamese have thus far failed to assign sufficient numbers of
                            highly qualified Special Forces personnel for counterpart training with
                            our own Special Forces. More emphasis on this program may be needed.</p>
                        <p>4) The shift of military emphasis to the Delta has been proceeding at a
                            slow pace. It probably should be accelerated. The best available
                            Vietnamese military commanders have not yet been assigned to the Delta,
                            although there is steady progress in this direction.</p>
                        <p>5) Terrain sweeps, which often fail to inflict casualties upon the Viet
                            Cong forces and contribute little toward consolidating control over
                            areas involved, continue to divert a considerable proportion of the
                            total Vietnamese offensive resources. These ineffectual sweeps are
                            steadily being replaced by the more effective “clear and hold”
                            operations. The process should be accelerated. Specifically there should
                            be an increase in protracted combat patrolling, in which air-supplied
                            patrols remain in the field for periods of several weeks, relying upon
                            ground controlled, quickly responsive direct air support as a major
                            element of their combat power.</p>
                        <p>6) Concurrent with the consolidation of the strategic hamlet program,
                            particularly in the Delta, the companion program of arming and training
                            an effective hamlet militia requires refinement and invigoration.</p>
                        <p>7) <persName corresp="#p_MR1">Manning</persName> levels of combat units
                            remain too low. Pressure must be maintained to persuade Vietnamese
                            authorities to bring these units to full strength.</p>
                        <p>8) Improvement of Vietnamese capabilities for combined air-sea-ground
                            operations is required.</p>

                        <p>9) More use should be made of the sea for tactical maneuver. There is
                            also a requirement to increase river operations, in order to deny the
                            Viet Cong these avenues of resupply and secure them for the

                        <p>g. Reduce non-counter-insurgency operating expenditure especially

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                        <p>1. The change of government in Saigon has provided an opportunity to
                            generate greater popular support and momentum for the war effort against
                            the Viet Cong. The government, however, is already running into snags in
                            organizing itself for this task. Even in the best of circumstances, a
                            satisfactory reduction of the Communist insurgency will be a long and
                            arduous process given the tenacity and strong position of the Viet Cong
                            in many areas.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The New Government</p>
                        <p>2. With the exception of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s
                            assassination, the generals who have seized power in Saigon have created
                            an initially favorable impression by their prompt release of political
                            prisoners of the old regime, their removal of restrictions on individual
                            rights and on the press, and by their promise to return power eventually
                            to civilian control.</p>
                        <p>3. They have moved quickly to try to win support from significant groups
                            and individuals estranged from the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime. Talks have been opened with leaders of the
                            politico-religious Cao Dai and Hoa Hao sects—which together have up to 2
                            million adherents, including several thousand in loosely organized armed
                            bands. Support from the sects could lead to improved security in some
                            critical provinces of the delta and adjacent to Cambodia where the sects
                            have wide popular allegiance.</p>
                        <p>4. Various prominent exiles abroad have been welcomed back and
                            encouraged, along with persons in South Vietnam who had been jailed or
                            otherwise barred from political life under <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, to organize and express their ideas openly.</p>
                        <p>5. The generals have voiced their determination to pursue the fight
                            against the Viet Cong, and appear to view realistically the serious
                            problems involved.</p>
                        <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0707"/>
                        <p>6. Despite encouraging elements in the picture, there are danger signs.
                            The most serious is the absence of firm direction and of a well-defined
                            program of action. There is a real danger that the situation may be
                            allowed to drift indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>7. The possible ambitions of some of the generals are a source of concern
                            to the others. Concern extends particularly to generals occupying
                            positions in security, police, intelligence and psychological warfare
                            functions where efforts to develop independent power bases of political
                            power could weaken vital areas of the war effort.</p>
                        <p>8. Many of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s former
                            officials and associates are under arrest or investigation, and the
                            generals are under pressure from elements of the public as well as
                            within their own ranks to purge remnants of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime. There is danger that a
                            vendetta, or the impression of a vendetta, may be created.</p>
                        <p>9. Not all appointments among the extensive personnel shifts underway in
                            the administration and armed forces promise improvement. We lack the
                            capability to assess the impact of personnel changes at lower echelons,
                            particularly among district chiefs who play vital roles in rural
                            counterinsurgency.</p>
                        <p>10. The selection of <persName corresp="#p_NNTV1">Nguyen Ngoc
                                Tho</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s vice
                            president, as premier is resented by many Vietnamese who claim he is
                            weak, without firm principles, and regional in his outlook. Civilian
                            members of <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>'s cabinet, who are
                            predominantly native southerners, are technically competent but lack the
                            political and administrative skills to shape policies or influence the
                            military.</p>
                        <p>11. Disagreements have emerged over the composition and role of the
                            Council of Notables which is to serve as a vehicle for harnessing
                            civilian talents. Prominent politicians, who feel it may be used to
                            forge them into an artificial two-party system, are still
                            “fence-sitting” as in the past.</p>
                        <p>12. Although there is no evidence of anti-government motivation in three
                            post-coup self-immolations in Saigon, the suicides may reflect continued
                            public unrest, stemming from unfulfilled, if undefined, expectations.
                            Such an atmosphere would increase pressure on the government to produce
                            some tangible or dramatic sign of progress.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Situation</p>
                        <p>13. The prolonged political crisis in Saigon has tended to obscure a
                            gradual intensification of Viet Cong guerrilla activity since mid-1963
                            reaching record peaks since the coup. After a period of readjustment of
                            their political and military effort to meet the challenge of stepped-up
                            US-Vietnamese counter-insurgency programs, the Communist drive by the
                            time of the coup had regained momentum and was approaching levels of
                            activity sustained prior to the increased US intervention.</p>
                        <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0708"/>
                        <p>14. This renewed activity appears to be somewhat more effective than
                            previously. The Communists have been inflicting increased casualties and
                            weapons losses on government forces at no apparent increase in cost to
                            themselves. They have accomplished this by changing their tactics and
                            reducing their vulnerability to government countermeasures. They have
                            concentrated their attacks on “soft” targets-strategic hamlets and
                            outposts manned by paramilitary elements. They have also improved their
                            defensive capabilities against government ground and air attack.</p>
                        <p>15. Although the Viet Cong continue to suffer heavy combat losses, they
                            appear to have access to sufficient manpower to more than replace these
                            losses. Their armed strength is now conservatively estimated at 80,000
                            to 100,000 men, including at least 21,000 to 23,000 well-trained
                            regulars.</p>
                        <p>16. At the same time, the Communists have continued to develop larger and
                            better-equipped tactical units, including some regimental organizations.
                            These growing capabilities have been made possible by support from Hanoi
                            in the form of cadre personnel and weapons. The infiltration of about
                            800 cadre personnel this year has been more or less confirmed, but there
                            are indications that this figure is only a fraction of the actual total,
                            which may equal or even exceed the 3,000 or so estimated to have arrived
                            from North Vietnam last year.</p>
                        <p>17. Increasing numbers of Bloc-manufactured weapons are being captured in
                            South Vietnam. Some of these are brought in through Laos and others
                            through Cambodia. The Viet Cong, however, continue to rely primarily on
                            captured weapons. Their net gain of 2,700 captured weapons since May is
                            sufficient to arm about seven new regular battalions, up to 30 district
                            companies, or more than 100 local guerrilla platoons.</p>
                        <p>18. The renewed Viet Cong effort developed even as the government's
                            vigorous counterinsurgency programs began to have effect last year. The
                            strength of the government's armed forces has been increased to some
                            500,000 men. These include more than 215,000 in the regular armed
                            forces, 83,000 in the Civil Guard, and over 200,000 in other
                            paramilitary elements such as Self-Defense Corps, Hamlet Militia, and
                            Citizen's Irregular Defense Groups (<gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss>). The government has a significant advantage in the
                            quality and mobility of weapons, and a monopoly on air support.</p>
                        <p>19. By stepping up the tempo of its tactical operations, the government
                            has probably retarded the development of the guerrilla forces and
                            deprived them of the initiative in some areas. The government has
                            followed through on other measures to improve its military posture,
                            notably in expanding and training the paramilitary forces. New tactics,
                            emphasizing ambushes and night patrols, have been instituted.
                            Psychological operations have been increased, with emphasis on the <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0709"/>Chieu Hoi “returnee” program
                            aimed at winning over Viet Cong adherents. The government has revised
                            its territorial command structure, deploying the 9th Division from
                            central Vietnam to the guerrilla-infested Mekong delta.</p>
                        <p>20. The strategic hamlet program, cornerstone of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime's counterinsurgency
                            effort, is now alleged by government officials to cover 77 percent of
                            the rural population. The Viet Cong have refocused their effort to
                            counter the strategic hamlet program, which in some areas is
                            overextended. Some hamlets are not secure against either attack or
                            infiltration, and offer their inhabitants few benefits. Some hamlet
                            defenders have fought well but about one-third of the hamlet militia has
                            not been armed because of suspicions concerning their loyalties.</p>
                        <p>21. The strategic hamlet program has been most successful in the northern
                            coastal provinces, where minimal resettlement was necessary and its
                            establishment was integrated with military clear-and-hold operations.
                            Even here, however, field evaluations indicate that only about half the
                            hamlets are fully effective.</p>
                        <p>22. In the highlands area, the strategic hamlets have been complemented
                            by the <gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss> program. These paramilitary
                            units have been relatively effective in patrolling their areas,
                            restricting Viet Cong movements and reducing their access to the tribal
                            minority people (montagnard) for food and other supplies. The success of
                            this effort apparently has been heavily dependent on direct US
                            participation, and setbacks have occurred in some cases after the
                            withdrawal of US special forces teams. Similar problems have been
                            encountered with the montagnard resettlement program, and seem to arise
                            from an overly paternalistic approach by US advisers, coupled with a
                            lack of understanding and sympathy for the montagnards among Vietnamese
                            functionaries.</p>
                        <p>23. The situation remains most critical in the Mekong delta provinces
                            south of Saigon—the most densely populated area in South Vietnam—and in
                            the provinces just north of Saigon. Here the Communists have base areas
                            of long standing, which government forces seldom penetrate. Food is not
                            a problem, and the nearby border with Cambodia affords safe havens. The
                            strategic hamlet program has been least successful in this region, where
                            traditional population patterns necessitate a great deal of relocation,
                            and where effective coordination of military operations with hamlet
                            construction has been lacking. Hundreds of strategic hamlets have been
                            attacked and harassed by the Viet Cong in this region, and the program
                            is being revised to stress consolidation rather than expansion.</p>
                        <p>24. The particularly intensified Viet Cong activity since the coup
                            appears designed as much for psychological impact and for testing the
                            new regime as for military advantage. It has been characterized by <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0710"/>widespread, small-scale actions
                            against hamlets and outposts, punctuated occasionally by larger-scale
                            attacks against more substantial posts or military training camps. The
                            Communists apparently hope to encourage internal strains in the new
                            regime until its leadership bogs down and the war-weary South Vietnamese
                            and US public become receptive to a negotiated solution. Both the Viet
                            Cong's Liberation Front and Hanoi have, since the coup, revived
                            proposals for a “neutralized” South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>25. Although the new government moved relatively quickly from execution
                            of the coup in Saigon to sustain the military operations against the
                            Viet Cong, there have been at least some dislocations in rural
                            counterinsurgency programs as a result of the coup itself and the
                            subsequent personnel changes.</p>

                        <p>908. For <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> from the
                            Secretary.</p>
                        <p>1. The President has expressed his deep concern that our effort in
                            Viet-Nam be stepped up to highest pitch and that each day we ask
                            ourselves what more we can do to further the struggle.</p>
                        <p>2. We have accordingly instituted an all-agency review of the situation
                            and of activities and programs and how they might be improved, looking
                            towards a meeting with the President sometime next week.</p>
                        <p>3. At preliminary high-level interdepartmental meeting today <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> presented disturbing analysis of the
                            current military situation, with the following conclusions:</p>
                        <p>a. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> desires to respond to US
                            military advice and to improve its operational effectiveness. It has the
                            capability to do so and its plans are basically sound, but it is in a
                            state of organizational turmoil.</p>
                        <p>b. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are making an intensive effort
                            to increase their hold on the countryside while the new government is
                            shaking down.</p>
                        <p>c. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have exhibited a powerful
                            capability for at least a brief period of intensified operations, and
                            their skill in counter-airborne operations is improving.</p>
                        <p>d. There is ground for concern that infiltration of materiel has
                            increased, but 1itde hard proof. This is a prime intelligence
                            deficiency. It affects not only military tactics but our over-all
                            Southeast Asia strategy.</p>
                        <p>4. The conclusions were based on these factors:</p>
                        <p>a. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> incidents have increased greatly
                            since the coup, going as high as 1,000 in one week. While presently
                            decreasing, the post-coup average is still above the 1962 average (363
                            per week) and the average for the first half of 1963 (266 per week).</p>
                        <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0712"/>
                        <p>b. The great preponderance of incidents are in the III and IV Corps
                            zones.</p>
                        <p>c. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> weapons losses have increased
                            greatly since the coup, and exceed by a considerable measure the 1962
                            weekly loss average (99) as well as the first half 1963 weekly average
                            (116).</p>
                        <p>d. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> weapons captured have not shown a
                            corresponding increase, with the result that the weapons loss ratio has
                            grown more unfavorable to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> since
                            the coup.</p>
                        <p>e. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> appear, despite heavy
                            casualties, still to be able to maintain their hard core strength.</p>
                        <p>f. The numerous changes in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> division
                            and corps boundaries, changes in major commanders, in sector commanders
                            and district chiefs have all united to cause organizational turmoil, and
                            to provide an inviting opportunity for <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            action.</p>
                        <p>g. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activities, such as that which
                            resulted in the damage of twenty aircraft on 24 November, exhibit a
                            growing enemy anti-aircraft capability. This is reinforced by the recent
                            capture of AA weapons and related equipment of possible Russian or
                            Chinese design.</p>
                        <p>h. Additionally, the continued appearance of recoilless rifles and
                            ammunition, of apparent Chinese design, as well as new Chinese rifles in
                            the Delta raises the question of the possibility of increased
                            infiltration.</p>
                        <p>i. Disquiet has been expressed by both <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>
                            regarding the possibility of increased infiltration, and has resulted in
                            recommendations for relaxation of various restrictions related to border
                            patrol and surveillance activities.</p>
                        <p>5. The foregoing presentation, although acknowledged to cover a brief
                            period, was viewed as possibly indicative of a protracted
                            intensification of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> effort, as well as
                            suggesting the possibility of increased outside aid, both of which might
                            seriously derange our prospects for the future. Your comments are
                            requested on the factors outlined above as well as on the
                            conclusions.</p>
                        <p>6. To meet situation described in briefing, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> made four suggestions, as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Institute program of pressures in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>
                            of rising intensity.</p>
                        <p>b. Institute probes into Laos, including use of US advisers and air
                            resupply.</p>
                        <p>c. Institute aerial recon of both Cambodia and Laos.</p>
                        <p>d. Accelerate dispatch of US economic experts to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7. After discussion, following was agreed:</p>

                            representative Young<note n="2" xml:id="d352fn2">Earl J. Young.</note>
                            on Long An Province as of December 6.</p>
                        <p>“1. The only progress made in Long An Province during month of November
                            1963 has been by the Communist Viet Cong. The past thirty days have
                            produced a day-by-day elimination of US/ Vietnamese sponsored strategic
                            hamlets and the marked increase in Viet Cong influence, military
                            operations, physical control of the country-side and Communist
                            controlled combat hamlets.</p>
                        <p>“2. At the end of September 1963 province officials stated that 219
                            strategic hamlets were completed and met the six criteria. Effective 30
                            November 1963 this figure has been reduced to about 45 on the best
                            estimates of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and the new province chief, Major
                            Dao. 27 hamlets were attacked in Nov, compared with the figure of 77 for
                            June. This would appear to be an improvement; however, the explanation
                            is a simple one: so many strategic hamlets have been rendered
                            ineffective by the Viet Cong that only 27 were worth attacking this
                            month.</p>
                        <p>“3. Of the 219 hamlets containing armed defenders (hamlet militia) in
                            September, 50 remain armed today. The remainder have turned in their
                            weapons or deserted.</p>
                        <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0714"/>
                        <p>“4. The reason for this unhappy situation is the failure of the Govt of
                            Vietnam to support and protect the hamlets. The concept of the strategic
                            hamlet called for a self-defense force capable of holding off enemy
                            attack for a brief period until regular forces (<gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, Civil Guard, or <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>)
                            could come to the rescue. In hamlet after hamlet this assistance never
                            came, or in most cases, arrived the following morning during daylight
                            hours.</p>
                        <p>“A few (ten or twelve) half-trained farmers armed with shotguns have
                            neither the experience not leadership to defend a large hamlet against
                            the efficient guerrilla force, no matter how small. When it became known
                            throughout the province that no help was forthcoming until daylight, the
                            will and desire to resist dropped. From this point even three or four
                            Viet Cong can—and do—demand entrance to the hamlet and receive it
                            without opposition. The hamlet chiefs murdered, the houses of all
                            relocated families destroyed, the barbed wire fence is cut, and another
                            hamlet is eliminated.</p>
                        <p>“5. Two explanations are presented for the lack of assistance: A. There
                            are not sufficient troops to protect key installations and district
                            headquarters and at the same time to go to the assistance of the
                            hamlet.</p>
                        <p>“B. Both official orders and policy prohibit the movement of troops after
                            dark to go to the assistance of hamlets or isolated military posts.</p>
                        <p>“6. Even today, the order by a Vietnamese military commander to one of
                            his units to remain (not conduct operations, just remain) out over-night
                            is so unusual that it brings marked comments and a faint light of hope
                            to his US <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> adviser.</p>
                        <p>“7. What are the implications of this situation to the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>/rural affairs program?</p>
                        <p>“8. The provincial agreement is tailored in each province to use the
                            strategic hamlet program as its vehicle for improvement of the economic,
                            social and security conditions of the Vietnamese people. Funds are
                            provided for assistance in moving to one hamlet, for training hamlet
                            defenders, for self-help projects to bring schools, medical treatment,
                            agricultural improvement and in general to upgrade the standard of
                            living through the joint efforts of the local population and American
                            assistance. When the Viet Cong have gained control or so terrorized the
                            residents of a hamlet these very worthwhile programs cannot succeed.
                            That is the situation in Long An Province.</p>
                        <p>“9. The strategic hamlet program in this province can be made workable
                            and very effective against the Viet Cong. But help must come immediately
                            in the form of additional troops and new concepts of operation, not the
                            same re-heated French tactics of 1954 beefed up <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0715"/>with more helicopters and tanks. The
                            hamlets must be defended if this province is not to fall under complete
                            control of the Viet Cong in the next several months.</p>
                        <p>“10. The newly assigned <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> adviser and
                            the new Province Chief have all the earmarks of intelligent, dedicated
                            and hard-working officers. But they must receive full support or their
                            plans will never leave the conference room.”</p>

                                of Sihanouk's neutrality proposal on the war in South Vietnam, and
                                the need for a renewed effort in the war against the Viet Cong. Don
                                mentioned problems with strategic hamlets in Long An and he informed
                                Lodge that there would be a marked improvement in prosecution of the
                                war in January 1964. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 S VIET)</note> notably his
                            statement that totally useless and impractical hamlets were built with
                            forced labor so that grafters would receive the money allocated to
                            strategic hamlets.</p>

                        <p>13. Long An is the province immediately bordering the south of Saigon and
                            its loss could cut off the city's food supply.</p>

                            already mentioned this to the Sec. The Pres. gave <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McN</persName>. quite a lecture on South Viet-Nam

                            personnel reductions and at the same time he told the press that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McN</persName>. was going to

                                Policies in Southeast Asia.” See <ref target="frus1961-63v02#d214fn4">

                                attached, is apparently that of December 1962 which was sent to the
                                President and reflected <persName corresp="#p_MM2">Mansfield</persName>'s own conclusions; see ibid., p. 779. This
                                report was subsequently sent to the Senate in modified form in

                                    Document 42</ref>.</note> Subsequent events have changed some of
                            the details. But it seems to me that the basic observations and
                            conclusions remain valid. In some specifics, actions of the Executive
                            Branch coincide with these observations and conclusions. In many they do
                            not. In any event, this material may be useful by way of background.</p>
                        <p>I would add only these thoughts on the present situation:</p>
                        <p>1. Present policy says that there is a war which can be won in South Viet
                            Nam alone. There may be only a war which will, in time, involve U.S.
                            forces throughout Southeast Asia, and finally throughout China itself in
                            search of victory. What national interests in Asia would steel the
                            American people for the massive costs of an ever-deepening involvement
                            of that kind? It may be that we are confronted with a dilemma not unlike
                            that which faced us in Korea a decade ago. It will be recalled that Mr.
                            Eisenhower's response was not to pursue the war to victory but to go to
                            Korea to make peace, in reality, a truce.</p>
                        <p>2. Similarly, there may be a truce that could be won now in Viet Nam
                            alone and eventually a peace which might be won throughout Southeast
                            Asia at a price commensurate with American interests. That peace should
                            mean, in the end, a Southeast Asia less dependent on our aid-resources
                            and support, less under our control, not cut off from <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0718"/>China but, still, not overwhelmed by
                            China. If there is any opportunity of winning that kind of truce and
                            peace it would appear to involve initially the following actions:</p>
                        <p>a. It would involve an effort to strengthen the hold of the Saigon
                            government on those parts of South Viet Nam which it now controls. What
                            is called for are political and social acts of popular benefit by the
                            Vietnamese authorities where they can act, even if it means curtailing
                            the present elusive and so far unsuccessful chase of the Viet Cong all
                            over the land.</p>
                        <p>b. It would involve an astute diplomatic offensive which would seek to
                            enlist France, Britain, India and, perhaps, even Russia and all other
                            sources of potential use in a bonafide effort to bring about an end to
                            the North-South Vietnamese conflict. A settlement might be on terms
                            which reduced our influence (and costs) provided it also inhibited
                            Chinese political domination. France is the key country.</p>
                        <p>c. It would involve U.S. understanding, sympathy and sensible
                            encouragement for the Cambodian desire to stand on its own feet without
                            one-sided U.S. aid. At this time, Cambodia would appear to be the
                            principal prototype of any eventual peace for Southeast Asia. It would
                            be an independent southeast Asia, not dependent on a costly U.S. prop.
                            If Cambodia falls to its neighbors or if it goes over to China, we may
                            as well resign ourselves to an involvement of years in all of Southeast
                            Asia at great cost in resources and, probably, lives. Or alternatively,
                            we will be faced with an ignominious and dangerous abandonment of the
                            Southeast Asian mainland to Chinese political domination. In connection
                            with these alternatives we need to keep in mind the rising public
                            hostility towards foreign aid in particular and government costs in
                            general.</p>

                            and down that General Eisenhower told him personally of his interest in

                            race, and specifically said that he had let <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> know of this interest. Joe said that General
                            Eisenhower <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0719"/>called Belair today,
                            however, to say that Lodge was only one of many and that he (Eisenhower)
                            could not support any one candidate over another because his travel
                            expenses in all his Republican travels were paid by the Republican
                            National Committee!</p>
                        <p>Mike Forrestal is just back from Saigon and reports that <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot</persName> has indeed begun to think in
                            terms of political possibilities. <persName corresp="#p_MM2">Mike</persName>'s guess is that <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> would very much like to be honorably free of his
                            responsibilities in Saigon and is hoping to be able to report to you in
                            about two months that the situation is so much better that he can now
                            fairly ask for relief.</p>
                        <p>I report all this because you may want to have it in mind in your last
                            instructions to Bob McNamara before he goes out there. If I understand
                            your thinking correctly, it might be desirable to have Bob say flatly to
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> that if he can leave
                            the situation clearly better than he found it, after six months, it will
                            be entirely reasonable for him to ask for relief in February. (He went
                            out in late August.)</p>

                            him very high.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NDG1">Nes</persName> is soft-spoken and a little
                            bit more Ivy League than I myself like in tone and accent. He is also
                            shrewd and knowledgeable, and while there is nothing quite like the job
                            in Saigon, it is true that the job in Morocco was complicated and
                            varied.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDG1">Nes</persName> showed justified confidence
                            in his ability to cope with <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. He said the main problem would
                            be with the juggernaut of the military, with lots of brass, lots of
                            money, and a limited sense of politics. I agree with him.</p>
                        <p>I told Nes that a major problem in this case would be to combine loyalty
                            to a quite strong-minded Ambassador with effective management of all
                            kinds of details in which the Ambassador would not be interested. He
                            showed immediate comprehension. Indeed, what I liked most was his
                            eagerness to take on an assignment in which it may easily be impossible
                            for him to satisfy us all. A timid man would not want to be <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s deputy right now.</p>
                        <p>If you approve the recommendation, it is planned that <persName corresp="#p_NDG1">Nes</persName> should go with Bob McNamara to
                            Saigon and then check back in Washington to finish his briefing, and in
                            London to get his family. We can get him on the scene in the first week
                            of January, fully briefed and organized, and I think more haste would
                            make less speed in this case.</p>
                        <p>I will pursue you after your meeting to get your orders.</p>

                                Subject is Sihanouk's neutrality proposal. It would be most helpful
                                if I could be authorized to say at this meeting that US has decided
                                to oppose conference and, in any event, not to participate itself.
                                We have reports that some of Generals are seriously concerned that
                                US secretly favors neutral solution for South Viet Nam and that
                                there is even suspicion that my stop-over in Paris on the way back
                                to Saigon was for the purpose of talks with French in this vein. At
                                this critical juncture I should like to be in a position to lay

                            solution but this in no wise reflects US Government policy which has
                            consistently been a win the war policy. As you know from recent
                            messages, this is US policy from the top down. You may further tell the
                            Generals that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s trip is further evidence of our determined effort
                            to accelerate our joint effort to defeat <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and not to let a single detail escape us that might
                            contribute to this goal.</p>
                        <p>As for Sihanouk's conference proposal, you may say we are not going to
                            participate in any conference under circumstances or conditions which
                            would jeopardize <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> interests or our
                            mutual objectives. Latest developments in Cambodia make it unlikely that
                            a conference could be held under conditions which would be acceptable to
                            us as well as to Thais and Vietnamese.</p>

                            have in mind, for example, provisions making it impossible for Sihanouk
                            to abandon neutrality and throw in completely with Chicoms and a
                            mechanism that would be effective in sealing the border. Neither looks

                            asked for three-way talks with UK and us and we are going to have them

                        <p>The most urgent current problem in South Vietnam is the strong Viet Cong
                            position in the delta provinces just south of Saigon. Recent reports
                            have suggested that Communist control of these provinces may be far more
                            wide-spread that we had previously thought. One recent report states
                            that out of 219 strategic hamlets in the Long An Province which had been
                            reported as completed under the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime, only 45 have actually been identified.<note n="3" xml:id="d360fn3">See <ref target="#d352">Document
                                352</ref>.</note> The implication is either that the Viet Cong have
                            infiltrated a large number of established hamlets because of the failure
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to protect them, or that the
                            province chiefs under the old regime reported as completed hamlets which
                            did not meet the criteria of the strategic hamlet program. Since
                            allocations of money to the various provinces were made on the basis of
                            the number of hamlets reported completed, there was an incentive both
                            for political and financial reasons for province chiefs to tend to
                            exaggerate the number of strategic hamlets built.</p>
                        <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0725"/>
                        <p>To some extent the recent rather alarming reports may be the result of a
                            new look being taken by the new regime at an old program. There is,
                            however, evidence that a certain amount of inertia has occurred in
                            provincial administration since the coup. A large number of the province
                            chiefs have been changed and some of the newly appointed ones have been
                            changed again. This has produced a certain indecisiveness in
                            administration, the effect of which has been transmitted downwards
                            through the district chiefs and into the villages.</p>
                        <p>Another problem has been the fact that the strategic hamlet program was
                            closely associated with Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and consequently has been criticized by the leaders
                            of the new regime. These leaders have not, however, come up with new
                            programs or new directives to replace the old; and until they do,
                            subordinate officials of their highly centralized Government are not apt
                            to take any initiatives.</p>
                        <p>On the military front, however, there is some cause for optimism. Since
                            there is now virtually no political interference in military operations,
                            regional commanders have, in some areas, shown more aggressiveness and
                            drive than they had in the past. More effective contact has been made
                            with the enemy by the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, and our
                            military people in Saigon feel optimistic for the future.</p>
                        <p>The principal difficulty remains what it always has been, i.e. bringing
                            the government effectively to the villages in such a way as to win the
                            peasants' confidence and support.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Operations Against North Vietnam</p>
                        <p>For some time the Central Intelligence Agency has been engaged in joint
                            clandestine operations with <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            against North Vietnam. Despite considerable effort, however, very little
                            has come of these operations, partly because of the tight police control
                            in the North and partly because of their very small size. It would be
                            worthwhile exploring the possibility of larger-scale operations against
                            selected targets in the North provided we carried them out in connection
                            with a political program designed to get a practical reaction out of
                            Hanoi. So far such a program has not been worked out and—even more
                            importantly—the capacity for carrying out larger-scale operations does
                            not now exist. It will take time to develop such a capacity, and there
                            is no reason why we should not do so while we try to work out a
                            diplomatic scenario in which military pressure against the North would
                            play a part.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Laos Cross Border Operations</p>
                        <p>There has been considerable interest in stepping up operations across the
                            Laotian border from South Vietnam against the “<persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> Trail.” This is a perennial
                            and has often come up when difficulties develop in the military
                            situation within South Vietnam. Actually <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0726"/>we have had little or no hard intelligence since
                            October of last year on the use of Laos as a corridor into South
                            Vietnam. The recent discoveries of new weapons and ammunition supplies
                            in South Vietnam have been made in the Delta and in the Ca Mau Peninsula
                            in the southernmost part of the country. I was told in Saigon that the
                            best guess was that these were supplies reaching South Vietnam through
                            Cambodia via the Mekong or from the sea. Nevertheless, carefully
                            controlled intelligence operations across the Laotian border should be
                            considered provided we balance carefully the risk of discovery which
                            would upset the delicate balance of forces in Laos against what we would
                            expect to gain from these operations. In order to do this, we should try
                            to keep the operations as covert as possible and make sure that
                            Ambassador Unger in Vientiane has a say in what goes on. Past experience
                            has shown that the best way of accomplishing this is to control this
                            kind of operation covertly through <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>,
                            rather than through military channels</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Guidance for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>In light of the above, you might wish to tell <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that you hope he will be able
                            to focus the attention of the Vietnamese generals on their first
                            priority problem, the immediate restoration of administrative initiative
                            in the provinces, especially the Delta. They should subordinate all
                            political dickering among themselves to the fundamental necessity of
                            getting the most effective officials appointed-and having done so, they
                            should keep them in their jobs and support them. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> might also tell them that in
                            his opinion it is of utmost importance to establish a new program for
                            the villages and immediately issue the necessary implementing
                            directives. He might also offer our help in getting up such a program,
                            something which should be rather easy for us to do, since it would draw
                            heavily from the old Strategic Hamlet Program.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> might also
                            direct our own military and intelligence people to cooperate on devising
                            a significant capability to strike at selected targets in North Vietnam.
                            The question of when and how we would use any assets we can develop
                            would be deferred until the Government here has worked out a
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
                            Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> should
                            investigate ways and means of ensuring that Laos cross border operations
                            are conducted covertly both from the Vietnamese and U.S. point of view
                            and subject to the closest kind of control to ensure that we don't upset
                            Ambassador Unger's continuous juggling act in Laos.</p>

                                [<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>] about this he
                            hoped he would talk particularly about the problem of Cambodia. He said
                            you have seen the latest take and it is quite distressing. We still want
                            to see if our Amb could produce something.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> said that when he left
                            Honolulu he was told there would be no decision made on cross-border
                            operation. He said he came here and found they are ready to go.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said nobody had agreed
                            to it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kaysen</persName> is going out.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said Bill [Colby?] is
                            going too.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> said the Pentagon has
                            the responsibility and has the control.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> didn't think this was
                            true.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> insisted they did. He
                            said he talked to <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> and
                            says they have no control.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said Bill is not under
                            this impression.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> asked where the
                            messages come in if we don't see them any more. He said that is why we
                            don't have control any more.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said Bill saw a few but
                            they divulged nothing.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> said the only ones Bill
                            could see are the old <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> ones. He said
                            whenever CIA is in control, we are okay. He said it is important to have
                            Leonard [Unger] come down and explain.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said he was not worried
                            about seeing this thing approved. He said he thought it was okay for him
                            to come down. Also they are afraid there may be some shooting from the
                            other side. If you want him to come down, okay. Unger has to be briefed
                            and be told to have a stiff back.</p>

                        <p>DIASO-34783-63. The President has asked me to stop in Saigon on my return
                            from the NATO meeting in order to assure that we receive promptly the
                            plans and recommendations of the Country Team for:</p>
                        <p>1. Covert operations by South Vietnamese forces, utilizing such support
                            of US forces as is necessary, against North Vietnam. Plans for such
                            operations should include varying levels of pressure all designed to
                            make clear to the North Vietnamese that the US will not accept a
                            Communist victory in South Vietnam and that we will escalate the
                            conflict to whatever level is required to insure their defeat.</p>
                        <p>2. Cross-border operations into a strip of Laos approximately fifty
                            kilometers wide. The operations to be carried out by specially trained
                            South Vietnamese forces utilizing such US advisory personnel as are
                            necessary. These operations would be designed both to obtain evidence of
                            infiltration of military cadres and military equipment from North
                            Vietnam into South Vietnam and also to disrupt such infiltration.</p>
                        <p>3. Such aerial reconnaissance as is required to check on the extent of
                            infiltration of arms from North Vietnam to South Vietnam through Laos
                            and Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>4. Border patrol activities designed to determine and check the extent of
                            the infiltration of cadres and military equipment from North Vietnam
                            through Laos and Cambodia to South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>5. Accelerating and intensifying the military campaign against the Viet
                            Cong in thirteen critical provinces. You will recall we agreed in
                            Honolulu that the Country Team would prepare a detailed analysis of the
                            political, economic and military problem in each of these provinces and
                            a detailed plan providing for the solution of those problems. The plans
                            should be specific as to geography, time and resources to be
                            employed.</p>
                        <p>As a foundation for the review of these plans, I should like to receive
                            the Country Team's appraisal of the effectiveness of the new
                            government's political, economic and military programs.</p>
                        <p>I expect to arrive in Saigon mid-morning, Thursday, December 19, and hope
                            to meet with you and your staff during that day and the next to review
                            in detail the plans and recommendations which I have been <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0729"/>instructed to take back with me to
                            Washington. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">William Colby</persName> and
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> will arrive a
                            day ahead of me for the purpose of completing a preliminary review
                            before I arrive.</p>

                        <p>1. Appropriate members of US Mission are preparing plans and
                            recommendations to cover all points your telegram.</p>
                        <p>2. Regarding your paragraph 5, believe that a political problem strictly
                            speaking has not yet emerged in the provinces because the new government
                            has not yet made up its mind on what its carrot versus stick equation is
                            to be. Moreover the evaluation of the political situation in each
                            province can only be done by a politically-minded person who is on the
                            spot and speaks the language and knows the individual people. Neither
                            the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> rep nor the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officer nor our own Embassy language
                            officers are in a position to do this.</p>
                        <p>3. Referring to the second paragraph of your paragraph 5, the new
                            government has not yet produced political, economic and military
                            “programs”. The most that one can say so far is that they are discussing
                            ideas and notions. I hope they will have some programs by the time you
                            get here, but I doubt it.</p>
                        <p>4. I assume you will want to go to work immediately on arrival and am
                            planning to hold the meetings in the MAC/V conference room which is the
                            best room we have in Saigon for this purpose. I estimate that two days
                            should be allowed for the presentation you want.</p>
                        <p>5. Would like one hour of your time for myself alone.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Viet-Nam</hi>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName> stated that the war is going badly and
                            pointed out specific reasons why there has been lack of progress in the
                            Delta area. He added, however, that a number of recommendations are now
                            being considered to reverse this trend.</p>
                        <p>It has been difficult to get Strategic Hamlet moving again because of the
                            lack of central direction and the re-establishment of administrative
                            controls. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Mendenhall</persName> believes
                            that it will take some time for the new Government to improve this
                            condition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> commented that a
                            recent report has been brought to his attention which states that the
                            situation in Long An Province is rapidly deteriorating. He asked if all
                            the responsible agencies agreed with this appraisal. There was general
                            agreement that the situation in this province is serious and that prompt
                            action is needed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> stated that the
                            responsibility of the Group to follow up reports on Viet-Nam that
                            indicate a need for action should be clarified. During the last few
                            months, the Group had received advance warning by various individuals
                            that the hamlet program in the Delta was becoming over extended but
                            apparently no action was taken to look into this situation.</p>
                        <p>The Chairman suggested that following Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s trip to Viet-Nam, the role
                            of the Group to follow up on the execution of programs for Viet-Nam
                            should be reviewed and clarified.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Thailand</hi>—Mr. Hannah reported that, in general,
                            all programs related to internal security are progressing satisfactorily
                            and it is <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0731"/>planned to follow up
                            on those programs that require special attention. Problems will
                            undoubtedly arise as a result of Sarit's death. Although Thanom has been
                            named Prime Minister, it is believed that there will be considerable
                            maneuvering for power by various rivals and cliques. However, at this
                            time the political situation looks favorable.</p>
                        <p>The Country Team has been asked to report by the end of the month on
                            progress that has been made to get the Thai Government to prepare their
                            own version of the Internal Security Plan.</p>
                        <p>The Group requested that Defense submit a full report as soon as possible
                            on what additional steps will be taken to correct the deficiencies in
                            the locomotives sent to Thailand.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Viet-Nam</hi>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> stated that he agreed that the situation in
                            the Delta was serious and that one of the reasons that this has not been
                            uncovered before is that previous reports on progress at the province
                            level had been too optimistic.</p>
                        <p>He observed that there is inertia within the new Government; although
                            they recognized that they have problems, little has been done to resolve
                            them, or to take positive action. He recommended that the US Government
                            get across to the key generals that they should stop political
                            quarreling and concentrate on the war effort in threatened provinces. We
                            should assist the current Government in the preparation of a new hamlet
                            program in order to get this program moving as soon as possible. If we
                            concentrate on the war, and not divert our attention to marginal
                            problems, the chances of success will be greatly enhanced. He recommends
                            that a high priority be given to the Delta.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> added that the Amnesty
                            Program is important and should be included as part of any accelerated
                            program.</p>
                        <p>During a discussion on the validity of reports on progress in the
                            provinces, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> stated
                            that it should be understood that normally there are only two US
                            advisors at the province level, one representing the military and the
                            other the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> mission. These individuals
                            have only a limited opportunity to obtain a detailed assessment of the
                            situation and, by necessity, have to rely on the province officials as
                            their chief source of information.</p>

                            should be less likely provoke press request for US public statement
                            (which we prefer avoid) on proposed international conference on

                        <p>Suggest you make statement along following lines:</p>
                        <p>“International discussion of the Viet-Nam problem has been suggested in
                            some press circles. I wish to state that the US Government does not see
                            that any purpose would be served by international talks on Viet-Nam. It,
                            therefore, is giving no consideration to such talks.</p>
                        <p>“US policy toward Viet-Nam continues to be as outlined by the late
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> in 1961 and as
                            reaffirmed by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>.
                            Like the Republic of Viet-Nam, we are devoted to peace. Our primary
                            purpose in Viet-Nam is to help the government and people of -South
                            Viet-Nam maintain their independence.</p>

                            defense efforts of South Viet-Nam will no longer be necessary if the
                            Communist authorities in North Viet-Nam will stop their campaign to
                            destroy the Republic of Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>“Our goal is thus to return to the cease-fire established in Viet-Nam by
                            the Geneva Accords of 1954. If Hanoi will cease and desist in its
                            subversive aggression against the Republic of Viet-Nam, and the
                            Government in Saigon is thereby enabled to extend its authority without
                            resistance throughout South Viet-Nam, a cease-fire will result.</p>
                        <p>“Meanwhile, as long as Hanoi continues to support the guerrilla war
                            against the Government of the Republic of Viet-Nam, the US will continue
                            to furnish whatever assistance is required to help that government
                            resist aggression.”<note n="4" xml:id="d365fn4">The Embassy, in telegram
                                1157 from Saigon, December 13, took exception to the Department's
                                proposed statement. The telegram reads as follows: “<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s immediate concern is conference
                                on Cambodian neutrality which they rightly fear would encourage
                                neutralism in South Viet-Nam and undermine will to fight in this
                                country. As proposed statement does not address Cambodian neutrality
                                proposal, I do not believe it would be reassuring to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, given context in which question
                                has been raised. We are better off standing on Deptel 922, substance
                                of which I have passed to them privately, and which goes further
                                than proposed public statement. “I must reiterate as strongly as I
                                can that until U.S. has turned down Sihanouk's proposal
                                definitively, there is going to remain in Viet-Nam a large residue
                                of doubt about our ultimate intentions. And this doubt will
                                inevitably have a bad effect on the determination of the new
                                Vietnamese leadership to pursue the war effort vigorously.”

                            have maintained a high level of guerrilla activity. To date, <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0734"/>with few exceptions, deployments of
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> military forces in selected
                            areas have not been able to compress the enemy into manageable pockets
                            and destroy him.</p>
                        <p>While increasing <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> operational activity
                            may demonstrate positive results in the near future, up to the present
                            time the Viet Cong have stood off a better equipped army composed of
                            regular and paramilitary forces totalling about 500,000 men; nearly five
                            times the maximum estimated strength of the Viet Cong hard-core and
                            irregular forces.</p>
                        <p>Statistically, the number of Viet-Cong initiated incidents, including
                            armed attacks, shows a definite trend upwards since February 1963 and in
                            general has remained above the 1962 monthly average since August. There
                            has been generally less fluctuation in monthly large-scale attacks in
                            1963, averaging about 12 per month, than in 1962. <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> weapons losses have risen over the
                            past year. Thus far, approximately 2,400 modern weapons have been lost,
                            900 of these in November alone. On the other hand, Viet Cong weapons
                            losses have gradually declined.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the casualty rate and particularly the <gloss target="#t_KIA1">KIA</gloss> ratio continues to favor government
                            forces. Estimated Viet Cong casualties in 1963 through November total
                            approximately 27,000 (20,000 <gloss target="#t_KIA1">KIA</gloss>), more
                            than the maximum strength of the Viet Cong main force figures carried by
                                <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> (21-23,000) or
                            almost one-half of the estimated Viet Cong irregular strength
                            (60-80,000). The casualties may have been over-estimated. Assuming,
                            however, that these are accurate statistics, the Viet Cong have two
                            means of replacing these man-power losses: importation of cadres from
                            North Viet-Nam or local recruitment within South Viet-Nam, or both. In
                            any case, large numbers of men are involved. Concerning infiltration,
                            only 914 persons are known to have been introduced into the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> during 1963. Even if this represents
                            only a small fraction of those actually arriving, clearly the bulk of
                            the reported Viet Cong casualties must be replaced through extensive
                            local recruitment. A recruitment program of this magnitude would appear
                            to indicate a lack of meaningful progress in government efforts to
                            attain control and influence -over the rural areas to deny the Viet Cong
                            their main source of strength—the rural populace. Most significant
                            perhaps, while the Viet Cong reportedly suffered over 27,000 casualties,
                            they initiated and maintained a level of incidents and armed attacks in
                            November which reached an all-time high.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong main force units have expanded over the past year. In 1962
                            there was insufficient evidence to confirm the existence of any
                            regimental-type headquarters in South Viet-Nam. During 1963, five such
                            headquarters have been accepted in the <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> order of battle. During 1962 a total of 30 Viet
                            Cong battalions were confirmed. This number has increased to 37
                            confirmed battalions in 1963. In <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0735"/>addition, the latest Viet Cong battalion has an accepted unit strength
                            of 400 men, whereas during 1962 <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            computed these units at an average strength of only 250 men.</p>
                        <p>There have [has] been some variation in Communist tactics during recent
                            months. For example, there is a growing tendency to stand and fight, to
                            attack the same objective two and three nights running, and to employ
                            large units when attacking objectives. In recent weeks there has been a
                            slight but noticeable rise in the number of Viet Cong daylight attacks
                            indicating perhaps a growing confidence in their ability to meet and
                            defeat government forces in open combat. <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> use of armor and aircraft, however, will tend to
                            inhibit enemy daylight activity. Also, in the past two months, there has
                            been an increased Viet Cong underwater mining effort.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong have improved their antiaircraft capability through the
                            capture of US automatic weapons and intensified AA training in the use
                            of small arms against low flying aircraft and helicopters. This is
                            evidenced by the growing number of <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>/US aircraft hit and downed. For example, during October and
                            November 1963, over 100 aircraft suffered battle damage as a direct
                            result of enemy ground fire.</p>
                        <p>Other factors favoring the Viet Cong are:</p>
                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Defections:</hi> The Viet Cong appear to be
                            defecting to the government in fewer numbers.</p>
                        <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Intelligence:</hi> A well coordinated and highly
                            effective Viet Cong intelligence and counterintelligence system is
                            believed to exist. In many instances where <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> intelligence indicated the probable presence of the
                            enemy and a friendly military operation was subsequently initiated, the
                            Viet Cong either successfully escaped or tactically dispersed their
                            forces and ambushed the attacking <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>
                            unit. There is recent evidence of penetration of <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> paramilitary forces by the Viet Cong over the past
                            year, facilitating attacks on the Civilian Irregular Defense Groups
                                (<gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss>) and the Vietnamese Special
                            Forces.</p>
                        <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Economy of Force:</hi> The preponderance of Viet
                            Cong operations has been carried on south of Saigon where only roughly
                            one-third of their main force units are located. The remainder of their
                            main force units remain positioned through central and northern Viet-Nam
                            where Viet Cong activity is relatively light.</p>
                        <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Communications:</hi> We believe that the Viet Cong
                            possess a highly sophisticated, effective and secure political and
                            military communications network.</p>
                        <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">Food:</hi> Food is a problem for the Viet Cong but
                            not a major one. The Communists have been able to by-pass controls
                            established to deny them sustenance, although they have experienced more
                            difficulty in the northern and central regions than in the delta where
                            food is more plentiful.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the Communist capability to extend or escalate the insurgency
                            has not been significantly negated. Available evidence indicates that
                            while the Viet Cong have not made spectacular gains, they <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0736"/>have prevented the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> from gaining effective control over
                            much of the countryside. Communist safe havens, bases, and transient
                            areas are available to them in North Viet-Nam, Laos, and Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>It is apparent that the Viet Cong are maximizing their present
                            capabilities, aided substantially by resources captured from government
                            forces. It is evident that the Viet Cong over the past year have
                            sustained and in many instances have improved their combat capabilities
                            despite <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> advantages in firepower,
                            armor, mobility, communications and airborne operations.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong have demonstrated an extensive capability to exploit the
                            opportunities of the provisional government's preoccupation with
                            political reorganization during this transitional period. Unless the
                            government attains organizational stability and is able to devote its
                            major energies to the prosecution of the war in the near future, Viet
                            Cong activities can be expected to increase.</p>

                        <p>1. This is a field appraisal of the current situation. It is not an
                            official judgment by this Agency or any component thereof. It represents
                            the observations and interpretations of a staff officer based on
                            information available to him at the time of its preparation. Prepared
                            for internal use as a guide to the operation environment, this

                        <p>2. The situation in South Vietnam from 8-14 December 1963 continued to be
                            marked by a lack of forward motion on the part of the country's new
                            rulers in getting on with the many-sided struggle against the Viet Cong
                                (<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>). The Military Revolutionary
                            Committee (<gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss>) continues to shuffle
                            province chiefs and district chiefs around; in some provinces a
                            succession of chiefs has been appointed since the 1-2 November coup.
                            However commendable is this reflection of the junta's desire to get the
                            best possible team into the field, in the short term it has contributed
                            materially to the disturbing degree of paralysis that now afflicts
                            provincial administration. Another cause of this slowdown includes the
                            continuing non-articulation of the new regime's pacification policies
                            and confusion over the chains of military and civil command and their
                            interrelationships.</p>
                        <p>3. Much of the current confusion and paralysis is unavoidable. The <gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss> rightly calls the 1-2 November action a
                            revolution, in the sense that it swept away the whole elaborate fabric
                            of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime's controls.
                            However burdensome and oppressive these controls seemed to many, local
                            officials at least had some idea of what was expected of them and had
                            the organizational resources for implementing national policy in the
                            countryside even though imperfectly and oppressively. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have been quick to move into this vacuum
                            of authority and initiative. Opinions vary as to the extent of Communist
                            gains since the coup, but most observers agree that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have made definite progress and that in
                            some areas, the situation has deteriorated <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0738"/>to a disturbing extent. Particularly hard hit in
                            certain provinces has been the Strategic Hamlet Program. It is difficult
                            at this time to judge whether this slippage in the program can be
                            attributed to inherent defects, which are only now coming to light under
                            the country's new management, or whether it is the result of the current
                            lack of firm leadership at the local and national levels. Both factors
                            are undoubtedly involved, although their relative importance is hard to
                            gauge. In any event, the time is short in which the new regime can get
                            itself organized and challenge the Communists' initiative without
                            risking setbacks of possibly long-term significance.</p>
                        <p>4. One action, taken on 12 December, which may help break the log jam in
                            the <gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss>'s efforts to put itself on a
                            better war footing was the exchange of commanders in I and II Corps.
                            Major General Do Cao Tri has taken over II Corps, and Major General
                                <persName corresp="#p_NKMG1">Nguyen Khanh</persName> has moved to I
                            Corps. Tri had for some time been slated for II Corps, but <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s new assignment had been the
                            subject of conflicting reports and possibly the cause of contention
                            within the <gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. As is often the case, heightened concern over the situation in the
                            countryside comes at a time when <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            attacks and harassment activities have in fact entered a period of
                            relative decline, following the Communists' record effort in November.
                            Judging from the experience of past years, the outlook is for a
                            continuation of this trend for the next week or so, to be followed by a
                            brief flareup of enemy activity in observance of the third anniversary
                            of the founding of the National Front for the Liberation of South
                            Vietnam (<gloss target="#t_NFLSVN1">NFLSVN</gloss>) and a more sustained
                            offensive after the first of the year, extending to the period of Tet,
                            which will be observed in mid-February. It should be noted that the
                            activity indicators provide no measure of the erosion of the Strategic
                            Hamlet Program, which is probably continuing, even though the level of
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> guerrilla activity is temporarily
                            down.</p>
                        <p>6. The honeymoon period between the new regime and the press appears to
                            be drawing to a close. <gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss> Chief Major
                            General Duong Van Minh, flanked by leading members of the <gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss> Executive Committee, on 9 December held
                            what appeared to be a suddenly-called press conference at which he
                            reaffirmed his confidence in Premier Nguyen Ngoc Tho and mildly
                            admonished the press to remember its responsibilities in a country at
                            war, warning it against promoting neutralist sentiment, among other
                            things. Much more incendiary was Tho's own self-defense at a press
                            conference held on the succeeding day. Tho sought to clarify, not too
                            successfully, his role in the capture and subsequent execution some
                            years ago of Hoa Hao extremist leader Ba Cut. He also defended his part
                            in the Buddhist affair last summer, correctly stating that he had
                            counseled moderation to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.
                            Exchanges between Tho and the attending journalists are reported to have
                            been quite heated, suggesting that the none too popular Tho may <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0739"/>be an easy mark for the press
                            and confirming previous indications that he will increasingly be a
                            center of controversy and a political liability for General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>'s and <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>'s
                            warnings to the press were quickly followed by the suspension of three
                            vernacular newspapers.</p>
                        <p>7. The new regime's sensitivity to the subject of neutralism was
                            heightened during the week by the suggestion of The New York Times that
                            a negotiated settlement with the north should perhaps be explored and by
                            Sihanouk's gratuitous and unwelcome offer to “federate” with South
                            Vietnam, if only the latter would stop fighting the Viet Cong and
                            espouse a neutral foreign policy. In conversations with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and other American
                            officials, junta leaders have shown great concern over the possibility
                            that the question of the neutralization of South Vietnam might come up
                            at any international conference held at Sihanouk's request to discuss
                            Cambodian neutrality. This specter, given some substance by Sihanouk's
                            federation proposal, would appear virtually to preclude South Vietnamese
                            participation in a conference, which in other ways would have been
                            distasteful enough to Vietnam's new rulers even if restricted to the
                            subject of guarantees for Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>8. The Generals continued, by personnel shifts and arrests, their efforts
                            to break up coup groups which had been in existence prior to 1 November
                            and which had been in competition with them. Among recent actions to
                            this effect were the arrest of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_TKT1">Tran Kim
                                Tuyen</persName>'s top lieutenant Nguyen Duy Bach; the arrest of
                            Huynh Van Lang, a former director of the Exchange Office and a Saigon
                            University professor; and the consignment of Lt. Col. Pham Ngoc Thao to
                            the limbo of a five month course at Fort Leavenworth. Other field grade
                            and junior officers judged to have trouble-making potential are reported
                            to have been transferred out of Saigon or are slated for military

                        <p>As a result of your demonstrated interest, Long An has become the center
                            of interest, at least momentarily. Some facts and figures:</p>
                        <p>Of the 219 hamlets previously reported as completed (with some 50 more
                            supposedly in advanced stages of construction), no more than 35 now are
                            considered to be capable of achieving the purpose for which built-that
                            is, of separating the people from the Viet Cong while providing them
                            both security and an opportunity for social and economic development.
                            Please note: 9 of these 35 hamlets actually comprise a part of the
                            provincial capital or of district towns.</p>
                        <p>147 armed militia squads previously were reported to be available in this
                            province (even this figure seems low for the 219 hamlets supposedly in
                            existence—some of them immense in area). Actually, no more than 50
                            squads exist and they are quartered in 37 hamlets.</p>
                        <p>167 hamlets now are said to have suffered extensive damage from the Viet
                            Cong. Of this number, only 5 still have any armed militia available (the
                            key to their defense).</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Some personal observations.</p>
                        <p>Three of the six districts were visited briefly during recent trip. Some
                            particulars on at least one hamlet in each of these districts:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Nguyen Huynh Duc</hi> (Thu Thua District). Located
                            about 5 kilometers south of Tan An and just off Highway 4, this is said
                            to be the best hamlet in the province. Homes are pleasant, look
                            permanent, have shade and fruit trees, gardens, etc. Since the Village
                            Administrative Headquarters is located here, there is also a 45-man
                                <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> post. The post is in a fairly
                            poor state of repair—weapons looked barely serviceable, no evidence of
                            recent attempts to improve defenses. Directional arrow for air support
                            was in very poor repair-no tallow pots available for night use. The
                            hamlet militia were said to accompany <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> on patrols “for training” but were armed only with
                            grenades. All SDC questioned were most vague as to extent of patrol
                            activity. <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> were not uniformed despite
                                <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> representative's assurance
                            that uniforms were readily available. It was reported that no hamlet
                            radio was available for three of the four hamlets in this village
                            complex.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Hoa Phu</hi> (Binh Phuoc District). No more than 4
                            kilometers west and south of Tan An, this hamlet has been destroyed.
                            Only 3 or 4 families remain of some 130. Many of the houses have been
                            pulled down completely; the fence is down almost everywhere and much of
                            it has been cut into small pieces. Interviews with the hardy survivors
                            indicated they stayed because they felt they had the permission of the
                            Viet Cong because of special circumstances. (One woman, for example, had
                            a husband in prison at Tan An.) Hamlet militia previously existed and
                            had been armed but had dispersed and turned in their weapons to the
                            nearby <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> post. This hamlet was
                            described by Rosenthal as the worst thing he had seen in his travels
                            throughout the country.</p>
                        <p>Within easy pistol shot of Hoa Phu, there was an <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> platoon ensconced behind a moat, barbed wire, etc. This
                            platoon apparently did not move out to aid the nearby hamlet when (it
                            was said) a small number of Viet Cong came and “asked” the people to
                            pull down their houses, cut the fence, etc. The post showed no evidence
                            of recent improvement. The arrow for air support was completely
                            overgrown by weeds, for example. <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> had
                            no uniforms, generally seemed apathetic. Detachment was armed with
                            French MAS rifles, had no automatic weapons. However, this platoon did
                            have the weapons of previously armed hamlet militia squads from two
                            nearby hamlets. (Why—with Long An less than 4 kilometers away—were these
                            weapons unnecessarily exposed to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            capture?)</p>
                        <p>In very early afternoon, with a fairly large armed escort, the deputy
                            province chief was reluctant to stop at Hao Phu. We drove back to Tan An
                            at breakneck speed after our visit.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Tap An</hi> (Thanh Duc District). District, as a
                            whole, is considered by local Americans to be the best in the province.
                            Two of the eleven armed militia squads still available to the district
                            are in Tap An. The hamlet had no radio—was dependent upon wire which was
                            clearly visible and could easily be cut. Nonetheless, this hamlet is in
                            extraordinarily good shape when compared with another nearby—<hi rend="italic">Thu Bo</hi>. About 40% of the dwellings were destroyed
                            there. Those persons remaining seemed to feel they did so at the
                            sufferance of the Viet Cong. This hamlet was “supported” by an <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> post across the river—by “patrols” and
                            by “direct automatic weapon fire”! Questioning developed that this fire
                            was over the roofs of the houses. District chief (who seemed both able
                            and energetic) said that only about 8% of those families entitled to a
                            relocation allowance in the entire district had received same. Although
                            his district is divided by a broad river, the district chief had no
                            patrol craft under his jurisdiction.</p>

                        <p>1. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> began by
                            asking General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> how he
                            proposed to organize the command in Viet-Nam so as to accelerate the war
                            effort. There was concern in the United States, he said, about the speed
                            and intensity of the war, and we would like to know under whose hand it
                            is going to be put.</p>
                        <p>2. General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> replied that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> was in immediate
                            command of the Army.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked whether General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, who is also Minister of
                            Defense, did not have a great many other duties and raised the situation
                            in III Corps, which is commanded by General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> who is also Minister of Interior. It appeared to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that neither
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> nor General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> could possibly operate all the
                            jobs for which they are responsible.</p>
                        <p>4. General Minh replied that it might appear that way, but that actually
                            the III Corps was well organized and that it consists of two
                            divisions-each of which is separately commanded—with General Dinh
                            providing the civil support.</p>
                        <p>5. When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said
                            that it would be better if General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> did not have so many different jobs, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> replied: You may be
                            right but this has worked.</p>
                        <p>6. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then
                            referred to Long An Province and some of the other critical provinces
                            and said that he felt he was familiar with the way things were at the
                            bottom of the social structure and that it was obvious that there was no
                            strong hand in charge. He pointed out that the I Corps was commanded by
                            General Tri, and II Corps was commanded by General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, and the IV Corps by General
                            Cao and asked why the III Corps should not be equally well
                            commanded.</p>
                        <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0743"/>
                        <p>7. General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> pointed out that
                            the III Corps had actually been divided into two small corps—one
                            commanded by General That and one by General <persName corresp="#p_NVTC1">Thieu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>8. Referring to Long An Province, General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said that the former province chief had been
                            absolutely worthless but that he had been replaced by a good man. He
                            said that the new government was working toward the day when there would
                            be separate persons for the jobs of Minister of Defense and Chairman of
                            the Joint General Staff, both offices which he now holds; and when there
                            would be separate persons for III Corps Commander and for Minister of
                            Interior, both of which posts are now held by General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>.</p>
                        <p>9. General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> said that it was
                            prudent to make maximum use of the services of experienced men in a time
                            of transition and that if you had nothing but people in the government
                            who had no experience, you would have confusion.</p>
                        <p>10. Under pressure from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said that during January a full time III Corps
                            Commander would be named. General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> amended that time to be “January or February”.</p>
                        <p>11. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was right to set priorities and
                            to pick out those particular provinces in the Delta, but he had been
                            struck by the fact that the total number of troops in the whole country
                            showed the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had a superiority of
                            five-to-one over the Viet Cong, yet in these critical provinces the Viet
                            Cong actually had a numerical superiority over the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. This made no sense.</p>
                        <p>12. General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> must have
                            seen the old plan because, under the new plan, the troops would be
                            deployed as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            desired.</p>
                        <p>13. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> to provide him with
                            the new plan before his departure and to take it up with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>.</p>
                        <p>14. General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> then described
                            the great results they expected to get from getting the sects to come
                            over to the government's side. Already the Hoa Hao had come over, and on
                            December 27 there was going to be a rally in Tay Ninh conducted by the
                            Cao Dai at which their allegiance to the government would be proclaimed.
                            He felt that the Hoa Hao and the Cao Dai between them could contain the
                            Viet Cong in their respective provinces and make more troops available
                            for the critical Delta provinces.</p>
                        <p>15. In response to question as to who was the Chief of State, <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> said that he was. If a stronger
                            or abler man could be found he would step aside in his favor. But at
                            present he was the boss. He was not Naguib and there was no Nasser.
                            There were no fights; the other generals helped him as a general staff
                            helps a commander.</p>
                        <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0744"/>
                        <p>16. U.S. could do them a big favor if they could dissuade Time and
                            Newsweek from publishing untrue articles about division among the
                            generals. When I expressed surprise that English language publications
                            had such an effect, Premier Tho said that the articles were translated
                            into Vietnamese and widely re-printed in Viet-Nam press. “You see, we
                            now have freedom of the press”, General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said somewhat bitterly.</p>
                        <p>17. On the matter of neutralism, General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> referred to the student demonstration in front of
                            the French Embassy this morning and which had gone “from 1,000 to
                            10,000”. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said
                            the U.S. was resolutely opposed to neutralism and that a negotiation for
                            neutralism was actually a negotiation for servitude. When General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> brought up U.S.
                            attitude on Cambodia conference, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> countered with the thought that <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> had observed V.C. success in
                            Viet-Nam in November and December and had concluded that neutralism was
                            really going ahead in Southeast Asia and that he had better join the
                            parade. This seemed to head off more talk about U.S. attitude on
                            Cambodian conference, which is usually a topic for heated and prolonged
                            conversation.</p>
                        <p>18. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then
                            brought up the question of General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>'s acting like a Chief of State and making some
                            speeches to the people which would give them hope and faith in the
                            future. General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> replied
                            that he and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>
                            had had two press conferences and wasn't that enough? When it was
                            pointed out that this wasn't the same thing as a really good speech, he
                            said that on January 2 the Council of Notables would be installed, and
                            he hoped to make a speech then. He also wanted to introduce television
                            into Viet-Nam so that he could use that as a way of rallying the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>19. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> recalled that when
                            Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had become
                            President, he had speedily obtained the support of the people by the
                            speeches he had made in Congress and to the people and felt that much
                            could be learned from his example. The generals were quick to point out
                            that things were different in Viet-Nam from what they are in a democracy
                            and stressed the fact that Vietnamese people are “extremely difficult”.
                            If many speeches were made, they would be considered to be dictators;
                            whereas if they accomplished things and solved problems
                            province-by-province and did not talk, they would come to be appreciated
                            for their works.</p>
                        <p>20. When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> spoke
                            of our desire to help, he illustrated it by announcing that 42 artillery
                            pieces were going to be sent from the U.S. and that we were going to
                            provide uniforms for the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> whose
                            morale, he was told, was very bad.</p>
                        <p>21. General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> explained that the
                                <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> in these critical Delta
                            provinces had not been recruited locally as was supposed to be done
                            because under the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            administration it was <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0745"/>impossible to recruit <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> in those
                            provinces. Therefore, outsiders were brought in from the north who did
                            not belong to the community and who had pillaged, looted, and held up
                            hamlets for money. When the people of a hamlet refused to give them
                            money, they would say that the Viet Cong would attack them and would
                            bring down artillery fire on the hamlet which refused to contribute. It
                            was really not a question of the morale of the SDC but of the fact that
                            they were pillaging and looting and now they were being sent back to the
                            north where they came from.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary:</p>
                        <p>The over-all situation in South Viet-Nam is a matter of serious concern.
                            There are a number of reasons for this-in the wake of the November 1
                            coup there has inevitably been considerable confusion and
                            disorganization as the new leaders have begun to shape the Government to
                            their liking; the military situation, particularly in the delta, has
                            deteriorated because of a high level of Viet-Cong activity against a
                            background of Government reorganization of its own military efforts.
                            Nevertheless, the new Government appears to recognize the problems
                            confronting it and seems eager to seek our advice and assistance. The
                            generals have moved, although slowly, toward bringing increased civilian
                            influence into the Government, and they appear to recognize the vital
                            importance of working out an effective resolution of their serious
                            economic problems.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Political Situation:</p>
                        <p>The Government announced on December 19 the appointment to a civilian
                            Council of Sages of 60 persons, including a number of non-Communist
                            oppositionists to the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            Government. The terms of reference and effective powers of the Council
                            are still unknown, but, if the new Government gives it an effective
                            voice in the direction of national policy, it could represent a
                            considerable step forward. Otherwise, the generals who led the coup
                            still seem to be working together in reasonable harmony, although it
                            cannot yet be said that they have effectively coped with the problem of
                            reorganizing the Government in a fashion calculated to inspire
                            increasing national support. Whether they will succeed in doing so is
                            the central question which now confronts us in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Situation:</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong took advantage of the confusion following the November 1
                            coup to step up their attacks on strategic hamlets, particularly in the
                            delta area. The number of attacks carried out by the Viet Cong has now
                            dropped to pre-coup levels, but the capability for increased activity on
                            their part remains unimpaired. The confusion attending the Government's
                            reassignment and replacement of virtually all province chiefs and many
                            district chiefs clearly affected its ability to respond effectively to
                            the increased Viet Cong activity. However, the level of Government
                            military action against the Viet Cong has increased to some extent and
                            is reflected in an improved ratio of Viet Cong killed in action as
                            opposed to Government killed in action (from 2-1 to 4-1).</p>
                        <p>The important military question now confronting us is whether the
                            Government, with our assistance, can effectively concentrate its effort
                            in the delta area in a manner capable of overcoming the Viet Cong
                            threat.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Situation:</p>
                        <p>We have embarked upon extensive joint talks with the Vietnamese
                            Government, centering mainly on the aid program, but covering a wide
                            range of economic problems. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Carl
                                Kaysen</persName> is now in Viet-Nam to guide these discussions. The
                            question which confronts us here is whether the Government can attack
                            its major economic problems in a constructive way thus improving
                            mobilization of its economic resources in support of the war effort and
                            the peace to follow.</p>

                            VIETNAM</p>
                        <p>19-20 December 1963</p>
                        <p>Since October, when the Secretary of Defense and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> visited Vietnam, there have
                            been great changes; some have been good, some bad, most have been
                            forseeable. In some cases the changes resulted from the coup, others
                            result from the circumstances which created the coup. Together they
                            unite to portray a serious—but by no means irretrievable—situation.</p>
                        <p>Operations of the governmental mechanism—at the top and at the
                            bottom—have decelerated greatly. The military Junta, comprising the best
                            Vietnamese combatant leadership, is preoccupied with politics, for which
                            they are not well qualified, and is largely diverted from the practical
                            task of prosecuting the war. The civilian element of the government is
                            of marginal quality, generally lacking in the breadth required to make
                            the complex administrative mechanism move. Provincial officials are
                            unsure—of their authority, of their obligations and of their tenure. The
                            same is true of the several layers of military command. In a very real
                            sense there has been an authoritarian revolution in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it is not finished. There are still continuing vibrations in
                            both authority and responsibility. Administrative functions are not
                            efficient, orders are often ignored or given lip service. Little
                            evidence of improvement is yet visible and, until stability does emerge,
                            essential things will not get done. This is the first and greatest
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>By and large our leadership is pressing the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to do the right things; trying to show them the way,
                            and the Vietnamese are receptive to our advice. However, receptive is
                            not synonymous with responsive. Orders are issued, but they are often
                            not carried out-because the chain of authority is still preoccupied with
                            its own political and economic survival, and the supervision is just not
                            there. In many cases the orders are unrealistic, where the task assigned
                            exceeds both the means and the time allotted.</p>
                        <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0748"/>
                        <p>The unfavorable condition now obtaining in the Vietnamese political and
                            military systems has been exploited aggressively by the communists. The
                            Viet Cong, immediately following the coup d'etat, intensified their
                            guerrilla efforts across the whole of the country. From an average of
                            400 violent incidents per week they moved quickly to over 1,000 in the
                            week following the coup. The Vietnamese, who were suffering from a
                            combination of indecision and post-coup euphoria, were quite unprepared
                            for the widespread and vigorous guerrilla attacks. This violent activity
                            met with little success in the northern and central parts of the
                            country. However, in the Delta, where there had already been
                            deterioration during the pre-coup period, isolated watchtowers,
                            indefensible guard posts and poorly defined hamlets-most of which should
                            never have been built in the first place-fell to the Viet Cong
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>Although the increased tempo of activity has been costly to the Viet Cong
                            in casualties, and though they have been unable to sustain the intense
                            level of operations, they have still given unmistakable evidence of
                            strength and a respectable exhibition of skill as well. In the area
                            South of Saigon, where the situation has never been good and where the
                            people are more interested in tranquility than in political alignment,
                            the Viet Cong have had success in recent weeks. In this area the
                            government's position is much weaker now than two or six months ago, and
                            it is likely that this success has encouraged the Viet Cong to intensify
                            their efforts still further.</p>
                        <p>In the view of the Vietnamese leadership, the deterioration process in
                            the most critical Delta regions has stopped, and they insist that a
                            painstaking rebuilding effort is afoot. This appears excessively
                            sanguine, there being little evidence that the provincial
                            administrations have yet crystallized on their immediate affairs.</p>
                        <p>While time is probably running in favor of the government in the area
                            North of Saigon, just the reverse applies in the Delta. Here, it would
                            seem, they must either stem the deterioration and start upward during
                            the coming dry season January-May) or face an almost unmanageable
                            problem when the next wet season comes on. The men at the top perceive
                            the urgency of the situation, but do not seem to grasp the importance of
                            the time factor in the equation.</p>
                        <p>This suggests two basic actions on our part. First, to inspire the
                            Vietnamese leadership truly to lead, to make everything secondary to
                            fighting the war, closing promptly and vigorously with their critical
                            problems in the Delta; and second, to give the Viet Cong and their
                            supporters early and unmistakable signals that their success is a
                            transitory thing, that it does not warrant an escalation in material
                            support, that the new Vietnamese regime is strong and that it and the
                            United States are both resolute in their determination to reverse the
                            post-coup Viet Cong success.</p>
                        <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0749"/>
                        <p>In connection with the first action-crystallizing the leadership to do
                            the right things and do them powerfully, we prepared for a meeting with
                            the military junta by reviewing carefully the situation in the critical
                            provinces, the worst of which are near to Saigon. We heard from those
                            U.S. military and civilian functionaries who have on-the-spot
                            responsibility, as to what the situation actually is, and what their
                            plans are for setting it right. An example is Long An Province, of which
                            you have read. It is in bad condition. In the summer, the hamlet
                            program, which had been going forward satisfactorily, began to outstrip
                            the military pacification campaign. Indefensible hamlets began to
                            succumb to the Viet Cong depredations. Then the coup preoccupied the
                            province administration completely and the Viet Cong seized the
                            initiative, almost without hindrance. Grave though the situation now is,
                            it is still repairable, and our representatives have a reasonable plan
                            for bringing the change about. Their plan, however, cannot be made
                            effective until Vietnamese deploy more forces to the area, and until we
                            increase the depth of our own supervisory and advisory talent.
                            Accordingly, a decision was taken to press the Vietnamese to double the
                            troop density—adding three battalions to the forces now in the province,
                            while we immediately move to increase our own civil and military
                            representation there from 9 to 23 people.</p>
                        <p>A similar appraisal of the situation in the other critical provinces of
                            the Mekong Delta resulted in conclusions of the same general magnitude.
                            All told it will involve deployment of 13 Vietnamese battalions into the
                            Delta and an increase of about 360 U.S. personnel in the area.</p>
                        <p>The general tactical formula will be to consolidate firmly the areas
                            which are now under government control, using regular forces to give the
                            residents an unquestioned measure of security, while paramilitary forces
                            are trained or retrained. Meanwhile the visible social and economic
                            foundations which will contribute to the lasting strength of the region
                            will be rapidly rebuilt. This process will be gradually extended,
                            increasing steadily the secure and tranquil areas.</p>
                        <p>Meaningful evidence of progress—or its absence—in pursuit of the program
                            will be available to us through the reports of our own increased
                            representation on the spot. There is no reason why these provinces
                            cannot be out of the crisis condition in less than a year, and
                            reasonably tranquil in two.</p>
                        <p>Coupled with specific treatment of the critical provinces, and in
                            contemplation of a conference with the Junta, we discussed ways to
                            enhance the effectiveness of the military and paramilitary forces. The
                            Self Defense Corps—heart of the rural local defense, suffering [<hi rend="italic">suffers</hi>] heavy casualties but enjoys little in
                            the way of recompense. We decided-and commenced the action—to provide
                            them with uniforms, <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0750"/>which they
                            eagerly want, as a morale factor. We decided also to meet a need for
                            more artillery in the Delta area by adding 42 artillery pieces to the
                            existing organization. In regard to the matter of exhibiting the
                            strength and resolution of the Vietnamese to their northern counterparts
                            the conference discussed several methods of rendering the North
                            Vietnamese participation in the war more costly, and thus less
                            attractive.</p>
                        <p>An excellent military-<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> study [which]
                            had been made in response to our request prior to arrival of the party,
                            covered direct pressures which might be focused upon North Vietnam, in
                            terms of actions of escalating intensity, ranging from minor propaganda
                            moves to destruction of major resources by raid or bombing. The study
                            was based on the premise that by covert means the North Vietnamese would
                            be warned that their support of the Viet Cong insurgents was about to
                            bring down direct punishment and, after an interval, to proceed with
                            selected elements of the escalative program, making clear always that it
                            would stop when the assistance to the Viet Cong stopped.</p>
                        <p>The great bulk of the resources for such a program are already in
                            country, and selected steps could be undertaken promptly. After a
                            further discussion with the appropriate agencies in Washington a
                            recommendation will be submitted regarding specific tasks which should
                            be undertaken. Central to the Washington appraisal will have to be
                            matters such as increased over-flight of Laos, use of bases in Laos and
                            Thailand and a comprehensive estimate of international and North
                            Vietnamese reactions to these steps. Meanwhile, and in advance of any
                            detailed approvals, it was decided to commence assembly, in country, of
                            all resources required for any part of the program.</p>
                        <p>As another deterrent to aid from North Vietnam, the meeting discussed the
                            matter of operations in a narrow strip of Laos (50 kilometers deep) by
                            regular Vietnamese forces, supported by air supply, aerial photography
                            and air attack, if required. The primary purpose of the actions would be
                            to acquire intelligence on Viet Cong infiltration from the North and,
                            where hard targets appeared, to attack them.</p>
                        <p>Here, as in the case of North Vietnam, the political problems in the
                            context of the value of what we expect to find, associated with
                            violation of Laotian territory, need study before a specific
                            recommendation can be made.</p>
                        <p>The group was briefed on the slowly developing <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> covert program in Eastern Laos, where Meo and Kha
                            tribesmen are being trained for intelligence gathering. The program has
                            developed satisfactorily, and could be expanded to seek intelligence in
                            the same general area as it is contemplated that the South Vietnamese
                            would investigate. Due to the hostile nature of the area, it would be
                            necessary for the tribesmen to move in larger groups, armed and prepared
                            to fight for <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0751"/>their information,
                            if required. This currently exceeds policy authority, which restricts
                            them to operating clandestinely in small teams. Anticipating the
                            possibility that the Washington evaluation may result in authorization
                            for broadening the scope of their actions, a decision was made to
                            commence training tribesmen in the necessary weapons operation and
                            related tactics.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the meeting studied the problem of increasing the task of the
                            Viet Cong by intensifying surveillance to all the means of ingress in
                            South Vietnam-the Laos and Cambodian borders, the Mekong river and
                            related waterways and the seacoast.</p>
                        <p>While we know all too little of just how much material and how many men
                            are being infiltrated into the battle, there is evidence that it is
                            considerable. Bloc arms are appearing in greater numbers and greater
                            variety and conservative intelligence analysis of documents and prisoner
                            of war interrogation fix the number of hard core infiltrators at well
                            over 1,000 for this calendar year.</p>
                        <p>The meeting concluded that surveillance of the Laos and north Cambodian
                            borders can never be highly rewarding, but that it can be improved by
                            better use of resources already in country. The Advisory Command has
                            developed a program which marshals the means available in a more
                            effective manner, and has already begun to press its adoption on the
                            Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>The maritime infiltration problem is even more difficult, but is
                            susceptible of more effective action. The U.S. Advisory Command has
                            developed a plan for intensified surveillance of the seaborne approaches
                            to the Delta as well as a system of barriers, check points, curfew and
                            mobile patrols to impose restraints upon Viet Cong movement over the
                            4700 miles of inland waterway in the area. At the best, these measures
                            will be little more than deterrents, nor would the situation be greatly
                            altered by a great increase in resources. The solution will ultimately
                            be found in the sum of all the counterinsurgency efforts, whose totality
                            will cause the Viet Cong to lose ground, resources, support and heart
                            faster than they gain them.</p>
                        <p>Following the plenary meeting, the Secretary of Defense, the Ambassador,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> conferred with members of the
                            Military Revolutionary Committee and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>. Matters discussed were as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>a. A strong case was made to persuade the Vietnamese group that the war
                            is suffering from the fact that key people are attempting to fulfill two
                            major obligations (Gen Dinh as Minister of Interior and III Corps
                            Commander; Gen Don as Minister of Defense and Chief of the Joint General
                            Staff). Their reaction, initially defensive, became favorable at least
                            in the case of <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>, in that
                            they stated—with some indefiniteness—that the problem would be corrected
                            in January or February. </p>
                        <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0752"/>
                        <p>b. The Committee was made aware of our conviction that there is now a
                            serious troop imbalance in the country; that a far greater troop density
                            is required in the Delta at the expense of other, more tranquil areas.
                            Following some face-saving discussion it was agreed that the Joint
                            General Staff will work with General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> on the problem.</p>
                        <p>c. Our concern with the committee character of the executive branch of
                            their government was discussed, which elicited a qualified disclaimer by
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, who asserted that
                            he does, in fact, make the decisions. Withal, the Vietnamese position
                            was not convincing and the U.S. conferees were left in some doubt as to
                            the actual manner in which executive decisions are taken. </p>
                        <p>d. General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, as the most
                            promising political figure of the group, was enjoined to make himself
                            more accessible to the people, to speak publicly and to convey directly
                            the programs of the government. He asserted that it is planned that he
                            shall do this, commencing this month.</p>
                        <p>e. The value to the government of the Cao Dai and Hoa Hao sects was
                            discussed, with a report by General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> that on December 27th the Cao Dai will declare
                            their allegiance to the new government. <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> stressed that their allegiance will contribute
                            substantially to improvement of the security of the Cambodian
                            border.</p>
                        <p>f. With respect to Cambodia the U.S. position respecting neutralism was
                            presented to the Committee, in terms of our estimate that <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s current attitude is
                            conditioned by his own belief that the Communists are winning in
                            Vietnam. It was emphasized that we would consider it disastrous if this
                            attitude were permitted to grow, and that it is up to the Vietnamese to
                            thwart it-primarily by victories. For their part, the Vietnamese
                            conferees deplored the neutralist writing in the U.S. press, and
                            adverted specifically to our failure categorically to repudiate the New
                            York Times.</p>
                        <p>g. The meeting terminated on a note of cordiality, coupled with
                            resolution and optimism on the Vietnamese side.</p>
                        <p>h. The Ambassador maintained notes, from which a check-off list will be
                            developed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Actions</p>
                        <p>The following required actions flow from the meeting:</p>
                        <p>a. Follow-up on decisions made regarding additional artillery, Self
                            Defense Corps uniforms, increase of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            forces in the Delta, increase in density of U.S. representation in the
                            Delta area, and procurement of material to support a possible increase
                            in offensive activity against North Vietnam. All of these follow-up
                            actions rest within the Defense Department.</p>
                        <p>b. Present for study by the Special Group (5412), the following
                            matters:</p>
                        <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0753"/>
                        <p>(1) Whether, or to what extent, there shall be cross border operations
                            from South Vietnam into Laos, to include ground reconnaissance patrols,
                            ground combat patrols, air resupply, tactical air support and air
                            photography—either singly or in combination. The Defense Department
                            should prepare the presentation.</p>
                        <p>(2) Whether, or to what extent, there should be an intensification of
                            pressures on North Vietnam through covert and military means. The
                            Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency should prepare
                            the presentation.</p>
                        <p>(3) In connection with (2) above, what shall be the authorities for
                            overflight of Laos and the transit use of Laotian territory. The Defense
                            Department and the Central Intelligence Agency should prepare the
                            presentation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>The physical resources—men, equipment and supplies—required to win the
                            Vietnam war are all present, with minor exceptions. The plans to bring
                            victory about are basically sound, subject to some refinement. The
                            Vietnamese are willing to follow our advice, albeit belatedly in many
                            cases, and the advice is good.</p>
                        <p>These are essential factors in the formula for victory. But there are two
                            others. One is Vietnamese leadership. This is latent but not now being
                            exercised, for reasons treated earlier. The other is administrative and
                            combatant experience. This the Vietnamese simply do not have.</p>
                        <p>The first shortcoming can be eliminated by the Vietnamese themselves, if
                            they will set aside their less formidable problems of executive power
                            distribution and face up to the need for unity and vigor in pursuing the
                            war. On this we can do little more than advise and urge.</p>
                        <p>The second shortcoming can only be met by the passage of time, where the
                            Vietnamese are concerned. However, our advisory mechanism is moving more
                            every day to fill the time gap, taking a greater part in the direction
                            of affairs. This, hopefully, will supply the final and essential
                            ingredient precedent to victory.</p>

                                to Saigon, December 19-20, 1963 </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Because of a late arrival in Saigon, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> spent a greater proportion of
                            his time with the United States officials and a lesser proportion with
                            Vietnamese than he had expected. The discussions with U.S. officials
                            lasted from his 3 p.m. arrival until 9:30 p.m. on Dec. 19 and from 7:45
                            a.m. to 12:45 p.m. on Dec. 20. They were resumed at 4:30 p.m. on Dec. 20
                            and continued until 6:30 p.m. The talks with Vietnamese officials were
                            confined to the period from 1 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. on Dec. 20.</p>
                        <p>After a private talk with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, the Secretary's first discussion was with
                            Ambassador Unger, and concerned the problem of infiltration into Vietnam
                            through Laos. Unger and the Vientiane <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> station chief explained Operation Hardnose, discussed
                            the political consequences of proposed cross-border operations from
                            Vietnam into Laos, and reported on the intelligence estimate of Ho
                            Chi-minh Trail activity. Also present were Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            and myself.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Critical Provinces</p>
                        <p>The first group discussion with <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>,
                            Embassy, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> personnel
                            focused on the problem of the 6 critical provinces in the vicinity of
                            Saigon and astride the Mekong-Bassac River complex. Both military and
                                <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> province advisors reported
                            personally on the situations they found in their various provinces.
                            Their reports were uniformly discouraging and indicated a considerable
                            falsification of data by the previous Vietnamese regime.</p>
                        <p>As a result of these discussions, it was decided to recommend to the
                            Vietnamese that a total of 13 additional battalions be assigned to these
                            provinces, that they be given priority attention, and that clear and
                            bold plans be executed as soon as possible. It was also decided to
                            assign an additional 340 U.S. military personnel to the 13 critical <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0755"/>provinces. Additionally, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> would augment its employees, largely
                            by hiring third country nationals, with a preference expressed for
                            Filipinos.</p>
                        <p>North Vietnam Operations</p>
                        <p>The second agenda item (on the morning of Dec. 20) was the plan for
                            operations in North Vietnam. A summary of this plan is attached (Tab
                                A).<note n="2" xml:id="d373fn2">Not found.</note> It is, in
                            substance, a catalogue of actions which could be taken, either singly or
                            in sequence, if and when political direction is given to execute such
                            actions. As a result of this discussion, it was decided to take the
                            necessary steps immediately to acquire and inventory whatever equipment
                            would be needed for the proposed actions. Personnel would be recruited
                            and trained, and all aspects of the plan would be readied so that they
                            could be executed when directed. The plan will be studied by an
                            interdepartmental group to be designated in Washington, and selected
                            elements will be submitted to Special Group (5412).</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cross-border Operations into Laos</p>
                        <p>A plan for cross-border operations was tabled and subjected to
                            considerable examination and criticism. Although the plan is being
                            returned to Washington for study, it did not receive any encouragement
                            from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. The
                            plan as conceived (summary attached as Tab B)<note n="3" xml:id="d373fn3">Not found.</note> would amount to a Vietnamese
                            invasion of all Southern Laos over to the region controlled by the
                                <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>. The invasion would be
                            accompanied by U.S. personnel and would also envisage air strikes. I
                            think it fair to say that this plan was a non-starter. The arguments
                            which I presented against it were not rebutted, and indeed were in
                            considerable measure reinforced by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> later said he considered the plan
                            “unacceptable”.</p>
                        <p>Attention, instead, was turned to Hardnose operations inside Laos, and it
                            will be proposed that the acceleration of this and the Kha plan be
                            considered by appropriate Washington agencies. Particular interest was
                            expressed in the stationing of Kha observation teams East of the Mekong
                            River in the Laos Cordillera.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Photo Reconnaissance of Laos and Cambodian
                            Frontiers</p>
                        <p>The case for low-level photo reconnaissance of the border areas inside
                            Laos and Cambodia was not made convincingly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, therefore, proposed that it
                            not be forwarded to Washington. He <pb n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0756"/>and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                            did, however, agree that nondetectable U-2 serial mapping of the region
                            would be desirable and they will so propose to Special Group (5412).</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Delta Waterways Control</p>
                        <p>The presentation which was given on the control of waterborne traffic in
                            the Delta was most discouraging. It is clear that the Mekong-Bassac
                            River system and the ancillary canals are not only the prime avenues of
                            Viet Cong movements in the critical areas but also a huge funnel for
                            military and subsistence supplies flowing into the hard core of the
                            principal Viet Cong base areas. Vietnamese Government control and
                            interception of this traffic is nominal to non-existent.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> plan presented for control of
                            waterborne traffic was not very useful. First of all, it was directed to
                            a whole series of canal and river checkpoints for population and traffic
                            controls, envisaged a tight curfew and a considerable interruption of
                            economic life in the Delta. Most importantly, however, it did not
                            address itself except in the most cursory way to the problem of
                            intercepting and controlling waterborne contraband infiltrating down the
                            rivers from Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>I consider this a major shortcoming which we should not leave uncorrected
                            and I have so informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. I recommend that the Department follow up on
                            this problem and prod Defense and <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            for satisfactory action on this critical problem. I did so with Admiral
                            Felt while transitting Hawaii and feel he will respond actively.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussions with Vietnamese Officials</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s formal
                            meetings with Vietnamese officials consisted of one briefing of better
                            than 2 hours' duration at 1 p.m. on Dec. 20 and one more private session
                            of nearly an hour immediately thereafter. In the first session he was
                            accompanied by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, Mr.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kaysen</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName>
                            and myself. There were about twenty Vietnamese, mostly military, headed
                            by Generals <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>, Little Minh, Kiem, et al, as well as Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>, Foreign Minister Lam,
                            the Minister for Rural Affairs and the Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>
                        <p>It was not a very satisfactory briefing. We were told frankly how bad the
                            situation really was in the critical areas, why the previous regime had
                            let it get that way, and how it could be retrieved. We were not,
                            however, given much indication of the manner in which the new government
                            expected to go about its job.</p>
                        <p>In the private meeting, during the period from 3:30 to 4:15, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was accompanied
                            only by the Ambassador and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>. The Vietnamese present were Generals <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>, <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0757"/>plus Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>. This conversation has been
                            reported by cable from Saigon. (Tab C)<note n="4" xml:id="d373fn4">See
                                    <ref target="#d370fn1">footnote 1, Document 370</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Additional to these formal meetings, I met informally with Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>, Foreign Minister Lam,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> (who is Foreign
                            Affairs member of the Junta) and with Ambassador Do Van Ly. All our
                            discussions were on Cambodia, the French proposals for neutrality of
                            Vietnam and the problems involved in a Cambodian Conference. I found
                            them all well-informed, unemotional and realistic. They were uniformly
                            concerned about the New York Times editorial on neutrality for Vietnam
                            and about a Walter Lippmann column on the same subject. The general line
                            I took with them was that Sihanouk was behaving as he did because his
                            evaluation indicated that Vietnam was losing its war against the Viet
                            Cong; and that therefore <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>
                            was attempting to hedge Cambodia's future by some sort of
                            internationalized sanitation. I also said that our prime interest in
                            Cambodia was to avoid having it become a completely communist controlled
                            base for operations against Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment:</p>
                        <p>The visit was a sobering one and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> typically took an honest, candid evaluation of
                            it. I was particularly satisfied that he centered his primary attention
                            on those problems which we in State have considered paramount (i.e., the
                            six critical provinces, the redressing of troop balance, and the
                            refurbishing of the strategic hamlet program) and did not get seriously
                            diverted either in time or attention to the various red herrings of
                            cross-border operations, aerial reconnaissance, etc. I feel confident
                            his report to the President will be one in which the Department can
                            concur.</p>

                        <p>In accordance with your request this morning, this is a summary of my
                            conclusions after my visit to Vietnam on December 19-20.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. The situation is very disturbing.
                            Current trends, unless reversed in the next 2-3 months, will lead to
                            neutralization at best and more likely to a Communist-controlled
                            state.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The new government</hi> is the greatest source of
                            concern. It is indecisive and drifting. Although <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> states that he, rather than the
                            committee of Generals, is making decisions, it is not clear that this is
                            actually so. In any event, neither he nor the Committee are experienced
                            in political administration and so far they show little talent for it.
                            There is no clear concept on how to re-shape or conduct the strategic
                            hamlet program; the Province Chiefs, most of whom are new and
                            inexperienced, are receiving little or no direction; military
                            operations, too, are not being effectively directed because the generals
                            are so preoccupied with essentially political affairs. A specific
                            example of the present situation is that General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> is spending little or no time
                            commanding III Corps, which is in the vital zone around Saigon and needs
                            full-time direction. I made these points as strongly as possible to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Country Team</hi> is the second major weakness.
                            It lacks leadership, has been poorly informed, and is not working to a
                            common plan. A recent example of confusion has been conflicting <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and military recommendations both to
                            the Government of Vietnam and to Washington on the size of the military
                            budget. Above all, Lodge has virtually no official contact with
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> sends in reports with major
                            military implications without showing them to <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, and does not show <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> important incoming traffic. My
                            impression is that <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> simply
                            does not know how to conduct a coordinated administration. This has of
                            course been stressed to him both by Dean <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0759"/>

                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John McCone</persName>), and I do not
                            think he is consciously rejecting our advice; he has just operated as a
                            loner all his life and cannot readily change now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>'s newly-designated deputy,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDG1">David Nes</persName>, was with us and
                            seems a highly competent team player. I have stated the situation
                            frankly to him and he has said he would do all he could to constitute
                            what would in effect be an executive committee operating below the level
                            of Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>As to the grave reporting weakness, both Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> must take major steps to improve this.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John McCone</persName> and I have
                            discussed it and are acting vigorously in our respective spheres.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Viet Cong progress</hi> has been great during the
                            period since the coup, with my best guess being that the situation has
                            in fact been deteriorating in the countryside since July to a far
                            greater extent than we realized because of our undue dependence on
                            distorted Vietnamese reporting. The Viet Cong now control very high
                            proportions of the people in certain key provinces, particularly those
                            directly south and west of Saigon. The Strategic Hamlet Program was
                            seriously over-extended in these provinces, and the Viet Cong has been
                            able to destroy many hamlets, while others have been abandoned or in
                            some cases betrayed or pillaged by the government's own Self Defense
                            Corps. In these key provinces, the Viet Cong have destroyed almost all
                            major roads, and are collecting taxes at will.</p>
                        <p>As remedial measures, we must get the government to re-allocate its
                            military forces so that its effective strength in these provinces is
                            essentially doubled. We also need to have major increases in both
                            military and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> staffs, to sizes that
                            will give us a reliable, independent U.S. appraisal of the status of
                            operations. Thirdly, realistic pacification plans must be prepared,
                            allocating adequate time to secure the remaining government-controlled
                            areas and work out from there.</p>
                        <p>This gloomy picture prevails predominantly in the provinces around the
                            capital and in the Delta. Action to accomplish each of these objectives
                            was started while we were in Saigon. The situation in the northern and
                            central areas is considerably better, and does not seem to have
                            deteriorated substantially in recent months. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> still hopes these areas may be
                            made reasonably secure by the latter half of next year.</p>
                        <p>In the gloomy southern picture, an exception to the trend of Viet Cong
                            success may be provided by the possible adherence to the government of
                            the Cao Dai and Hoa Hao sects, which total three million people and
                            control key areas along the Cambodian border. The Hoa Hao have already
                            made some sort of agreement, and the Cao Dai are expected to do so at
                            the end of this month. However, it is not clear that their influence
                            will be more than neutralized by these agreements, or that they will in
                            fact really pitch in on the government's side.</p>

                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Infiltration</hi> of men and equipment from North
                            Vietnam continues using (a) land corridors through Laos and Cambodia;
                            (b) the Mekong River waterways from Cambodia; (c) some possible entry
                            from the sea and the tip of the Delta. The best guess is that 1000-1500
                            Viet Cong cadres entered South Vietnam from Laos in the first nine
                            months of 1963. The Mekong route (and also the possible sea entry) is
                            apparently used for heavier weapons and ammunition and raw materials
                            which have been turning up in increasing numbers in the south and of
                            which we have captured a few shipments.</p>
                        <p>To counter this infiltration, we reviewed in Saigon various plans
                            providing for cross-border operations into Laos. On the scale proposed,
                            I am quite clear that these would not be politically acceptable or even
                            militarily effective. Our first need would be immediate U-2 mapping of
                            the whole Laos and Cambodian border, and this we are preparing on an
                            urgent basis.</p>
                        <p>One other step we can take is to expand the existing limited but
                            remarkably effective operations on the Laos side, the so-called
                            Operation Hardnose, so that it at least provides reasonable intelligence
                            on movements all the way along the Laos corridor; plans to expand this
                            will be prepared and presented for approval in about two weeks.</p>
                        <p>As to the waterways, the military plans presented in Saigon were
                            unsatisfactory, and a special naval team is being sent at once from
                            Honolulu to determine what more can be done. The whole waterway system
                            is so vast, however, that effective policing may be impossible.</p>
                        <p>In general, the infiltration problem, while serious and annoying, is a
                            lower priority than the key problems discussed earlier. However, we
                            should do what we can to reduce it.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Plans for Covert Action into North Vietnam</hi> were
                            prepared as we had requested and were an excellent job. They present a

                            Vietnam from which I believe we should aim to select those that provide
                            maximum pressure with minimum risk. In accordance with your direction at

                            the most exposed force and suffers from low morale. Of greater potential
                            significance, I have directed the Military Departments to review
                            urgently the quality of the people we are sending to Vietnam. It seems
                            to have fallen off considerably from the high standards applied in the

                            scared, hoping for the best, but preparing for more forceful moves if

                        <p>Dear Mr. President: I have read Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s memorandum to you on the Vietnam

                        <p>There is no substantive difference between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and myself except perhaps I
                            feel a little less pessimistic than he. Nevertheless, as I state in my
                            conclusion, there are more reasons to be pessimistic than to be
                            optimistic about the prospects of our success in South Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>Much depends on the ability of the Military Revolutionary Committee
                                (<gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss>) to provide strong leadership
                            and inspiration to the people of Vietnam, to properly administer the
                            affairs of the country, and to successfully prosecute the war. All this
                            is yet to be demonstrated.</p>
                        <p>I am dispatching to Saigon a number of our “old South Vietnamese hands”

                            complement reporting we receive through the other channels.</p>
                        <p>I intend to return to South Vietnam in 90 days or sooner.</p>

                                1963<note n="4" xml:id="d375fn4">Secret. Drafted by <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> on December 21.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. There is no organized government in South Vietnam at this time. The
                            Military Revolutionary Committee (<gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss>)
                            is in control, but strong leadership and administrative procedures are
                            lacking. Reports were received that province and district chiefs do not
                            act because of the lack of direction and orders. Nevertheless, the
                                <gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss> are confident. They feel they
                            are winning the support of the people. They recognize there is a big job
                            ahead but feel it is not insurmountable, and they feel their plan of
                            organization will lead to success. They claim complete understanding
                            among all members, however, there is evidence of tension, which, if it
                            grows, could lead to serious political difficulties.</p>
                        <p>2. The Military Revolutionary Committee, <gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss>, has replaced about 70 percent of the 42 province
                            chiefs and a substantial number of the 253 district chiefs. This
                            replacement program is continuing. Many appointments are reported to be
                            good, some not so good. The <gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss> feel
                            that practically all must be replaced.</p>
                        <p>3. The MRC feel they have reached an understanding with the Hoa Hao and
                            on 27 December will reach agreement with the Cao Dai. These arrangements
                            could substantially improve the security of the Cambodian border,
                            relieve <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> troops in Hoa Hao and Cao
                            Dai provinces, provide important information on <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> concentrations and <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0763"/>activities, and have a significant psychological impact
                            on the population. The success of the detente arrangements will bear
                            significantly on the future of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. It is abundantly clear that statistics received over the past year or
                            more from the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials and reported
                            by the US mission on which we gauged the trend of the war were grossly
                            in error. Conditions in the delta and in the areas immediately north of
                            Saigon are more serious now than expected and were probably never as
                            good as reported. The Viet Cong control larger percentages of the
                            population, greater amounts of territory, and have destroyed or occupied
                            more strategic hamlets than expected. Admittedly, this area of South
                            Vietnam had been recognized as the most serious. Revelation of factual
                            data evidences a far greater problem for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in arresting the unfavorable trend and recovering the
                            situation than was thought.</p>
                        <p>5. Starting in about July, indices on progress of the war fumed
                            unfavorable for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The number of
                            Viet Cong attacks and the losses of strategic hamlets to the Viet Cong
                            increased. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> casualties vs <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> casualties, weapons lost vs weapons
                            captured, etc., all turned in favor of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and against the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The
                            trend lines were gradual until 1 November, the date of the coup, and
                            then moved very sharply against the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            because of a great increase in number and intensity of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks in the weeks immediately
                            following the coup.</p>
                        <p>6. The tempo of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activities has slowed
                            down. Incidents were fewer during the last week in November and have
                            continued at a lower rate so far in December. Concurrently, the tempo of
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> activities has increased. Hence,
                            the trend lines of all indices have turned in favor of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in recent weeks, although in no
                            instance has the situation which existed in June or July, 1963, been
                            recovered.</p>
                        <p>7. There is continuing evidence of infiltration of cadres and small arms
                            from North Vietnam through Laos and across the Laotian border. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> intelligence reports indicate 1550 men
                            with substantial but not precisely known quantities of arms have entered
                            South Vietnam from North Vietnam through Laos this year.</p>
                        <p>8. Large machine weapons, such as recoilless rifles, mortars, and
                            anti-aircraft guns, and men trained in their use, have appeared in the
                            delta in recent months. It is not known whether they came through Laos
                            and Cambodia and across the border, down the rivers, or by sea. Large
                            weapons have not appeared in the northern sectors of South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>9. The <gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss> recognizes the seriousness of
                            the problems in the delta and have taken a number of actions which they
                            feel will produce results. However, there is evidence of serious
                            deficiencies in the Self-Defense Corps, which must be corrected. Also,
                            there is an urgent need for substantially more organized <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> units in the delta and the provinces
                            around Saigon.</p>
                        <pb n="738" xml:id="pg_738" facs="0764"/>
                        <p>10. The strategic hamlet has encountered resistance in the delta because
                            relocation removed families from their fields and locations occupied for
                            generations. Many defections of entire villages were reported as due to
                            the above reason. The villages built along the banks of rivers and
                            canals could not be rearranged into defendable compounds without
                            hardships the villagers considered unacceptable.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>It is my conclusion that the coup came when there was a downward trend
                            which was more serious than was reported and, therefore, more serious
                            than realized.</p>
                        <p>The military government may be an improvement over the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> regime, but this is not as yet established and the
                            future of the war remains in doubt.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong are receiving substantial support from North Vietnam and
                            possibly elsewhere, and this support can be increased. Stopping this by
                            sealing the borders, the extensive waterways, and the long coastline is
                            difficult, if not impossible.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> appeal to the people of South
                            Vietnam on political grounds has been effective, gained recruits for
                            their armed forces, and neutralized resistance.</p>
                        <p>The ability of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to reverse this
                            trend remains to be proven. Much depends on the ability of the <gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss> to deploy their forces and pursue the
                            conflict in a manner which will ensure the security of the people and
                            provide them desired freedom, privileges, and some tangible
                            benefits.</p>
                        <p>The lack of an outstanding individual to lead and absence of
                            administrative experience within the <gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss>
                            are ominous indicators.</p>
                        <p>The political stability of the new government under the <gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss> is subject to serious doubt. Conflicts
                            of ambition, jealousy, differences of opinion over policy matters all
                            are possible, could develop serious schisms, precipitate further
                            dissensions and coup attempts all of which will affect the war effort
                            against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Overcoming the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> movement by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is formidable and difficult, but not
                            impossible. The problems can be intensified by continuing increased
                            support from <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> and political failures
                            by the <gloss target="#t_MRC1">MRC</gloss>. Hence, in my judgment, there
                            are more reasons to doubt the future of the effort under present
                            programs and moderate extensions to existing programs (i.e., harassing
                            sabotage against <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, border crossings,
                            etc.) than there are reasons to be optimistic about the future of our
                            cause in South Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>On December 23, 1963, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Maxwell Taylor</persName>, met with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> at 2:45 p.m.,
                            primarily to discuss <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s
                            recent visit to India and Pakistan. At the end of the meeting, the
                            President and <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> briefly
                            touched upon Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s
                            account of this discussion reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">“Vietnam situation</hi>. He expressed concern over the
                            situation in Vietnam. Plainly, he had been impressed by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s recent report.
                            The aspects of the discussion included personal consideration of

                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> was probably the
                            only general who could get along with <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and that the real solution probably lay in the
                            substitution of a single military man to act both as Ambassador and as

                        <p>Dear Mr. Secretary: I very much appreciated the chance to talk with you
                            last week and to review what we here can usefully do about the problem
                            of Viet <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> infiltration in
                            South Viet-Nam via Laos.</p>
                        <p>Toward the close of our conversation, you very naturally asked why it is
                            that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> would react so negatively to South Vietnamese and
                            U.S. intervention in Laos to cut off the <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho
                                Chi Minh</persName> trail when he well knows that the North
                            Vietnamese are every day violating the Geneva Accords by their use of
                            the trail. There was little time to pursue that question, an important
                            one, and I would like to try therefore to explain to you Souvanna's
                            thinking in this regard as I understand it.</p>
                        <p>His entire emphasis is, as it has been for some time, to keep his country
                            together and to bring to an end the civil war which has been plaguing it
                            on and off for 20 years or more. <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Souvanna</persName> is persuaded that the civil war would long
                            since have come to an end if it were not <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0766"/>for outside stimulation and he recognizes that the most
                            persistent and pernicious stimulation has come from the communist side.
                            The Geneva Accords were specifically designed to bring such interference
                            to an end and it is on these Accords that he, and increasingly other Lao
                            as well, rest their hopes for their country's future.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister is optimistic but he is not naive, and he is well
                            aware of the Viet <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> failure
                            to live up to the Geneva Accords. He knows in general at least about
                            their use of Laotian territory in their aggression against South Viet
                            Nam. While he deplores this, his central aim remains, as noted, to hold
                            his country together and damp down if not extinguish the civil war.
                            Therefore, he has the most profound misgivings about any actions which
                            risk making Laos again an international battleground, however much he
                            might recognize Viet <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>
                            responsibility for the problem. I am sure he is persuaded, and past
                            history supports his view, that South Vietnamese or American
                            intervention would not end the problem but would more probably again
                            lead to a new round of fighting from which the Lao would be the
                            principal losers.</p>
                        <p>This does not mean, in my opinion, that we have to stand by and take it.
                            As you know, I am persuaded there is a good deal we can accomplish
                            through covert teams which are Laotian, even though considerably
                            supported and guided by us. I am persuaded, too, that there is a chance
                            of modifying <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Souvanna</persName>'s view, as
                            outlined above, to the extent we can have the Viet <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> intervention in Laos publicly
                            exposed and condemned by responsible international authority, such as
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. This is easier said than done
                            as the record of the past 18 months shows, but I believe that
                            international condemnation of the Viet <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> might give <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Souvanna</persName> more confidence than he has today that they can
                            be opposed, perhaps even with some outside help, without risking
                            escalation and a new war in Laos. We are, of course, working on both
                            these lines; meanwhile we will also do our best to help with those of
                            the other actions discussed during our recent meeting which do not
                            appear seriously to risk the undoing of the Geneva Accords and the
                            structure built upon their foundation.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background.</p>
                        <p>This memorandum is based on an investigation of available evidence of
                            continuing support in the form of men and materiel for the Viet Cong
                            from sources outside South Viet Nam. A report on this subject dated
                            November 28, 1963,<note n="2" xml:id="d378fn2">Not found.</note> and
                            prepared by <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> was considered.
                            Interrogation reports of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> prisoners
                            were studied. I also talked with American and Vietnamese officials,
                            military and civilian, concerned with this problem during a visit to
                            Saigon December 12-20.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Current Situation.</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt that the elaborate program of control and support of
                            the Viet Cong by the Communist regime in North Viet Nam is continuing.
                            The support ranges from words to weapons. Radio Hanoi and official
                            publications in North Viet Nam boast openly of their “positive support”
                            for the so-called Liberation Front in the South. Unfortunately, some of
                            the evidence that points most clearly to Hanoi's connection with the
                            Viet Cong cannot be used publicly for reasons of security.</p>
                        <p>The flow of military personnel from North Viet Nam into the South through
                            Laos and Cambodia is continuing. The rate, however, appears below that
                            of 1962 which in turn was less than 1961. Also, statistical indicators
                            on the flow of infiltration must be taken with a grain of salt. In most
                            cases they are derived from single sources and should be regarded as
                            only rough approximations. On the other hand, we must assume that for
                            every infiltration group exposed by the testimony of a defector or
                            prisoner, there are other groups never exposed.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of prisoner reports, <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            estimates that more than 7,600 men have entered South Viet Nam from the
                            North since January 1961. Of these, approximately 1,000 are believed to
                            have entered this year. For the most part, recent entrants appear to
                            have been political cadres, small unit leaders and specialists in armor,
                            transport and antiaircraft.</p>
                        <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0768"/>
                        <p>Espionage agents continue to come from the North. Four from a seaborne
                            operation were captured earlier this year.</p>
                        <p>The flow of weapons and ammunition of Communist bloc origin appears to
                            have increased. Russian-made carbines have been picked up in increasing
                            numbers. Heavier weapons, mortars and recoilless rifles and the like
                            have been seized. In one raid on a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            supply depot this month, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> claims
                            to have captured a large stock of weapons, ammunition and other
                            equipment, much of it of bloc origin. For example, the haul included
                            160,000 rounds of carbine ammo and 100,000 rounds of Chinese heavy
                            machine-gun ammo.</p>
                        <p>Chemicals for production of explosives have been seized in large
                            quantities. Much of this apparently comes from Cambodia. Imports of such
                            chemicals into Cambodia in the last year or so have greatly exceeded
                            domestic requirements. In the raid cited above, more than two tons of
                            potassium nitrate were found and destroyed. Other shipments have been
                            captured on the waterways of the Delta region.</p>
                        <p>Other materiel of clearly non-Vietnamese manufacture—medical supplies,
                            radios, communications equipment, etc.—have been found.</p>
                        <p>In summary, infiltration of men and materiel from outside South Viet Nam
                            in support of the Viet Cong is continuing. However, this is but one
                            factor among many in the situation. To regard it as the decisive element
                            in explaining Viet Cong successes over the past year would be an
                            error.</p>
                        <p>It is quite clear that the primary source of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> manpower is the South Vietnamese population itself. It
                            is also clear from the weapons loss ratio (2 to 1 in favor of the VC in
                            recent months) that external supply of arms is not a critical
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, infiltration serves several important purposes from the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> point of view—in providing a
                            supply of and/or replacement for key cadre personnel; in supplying heavy
                            weapons for use against armored vehicles, reinforced defensive positions
                            and aircraft; as a morale factor for the VC by providing constant
                            reminders of external support; and as a source of supply of equipment
                            and material not readily obtainable through military action.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions.</p>
                        <p>Infiltration from the outside in support of the Viet Cong continues.
                            There is sufficient evidence in hand to make a convincing case in the
                            eyes of much of world opinion. We can demonstrate that the program of
                            external support outlined in our earlier report (“A Threat to the
                                Peace”)<note n="3" xml:id="d378fn3">
                                <hi rend="italic">A Threat to Peace: North Viet-Nam's Effort To
                                    Conquer South Viet-Nam</hi>. (Department of State Publication
                                7308, December 1961)</note> goes on.</p>
                        <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0769"/>
                        <p>We should not undertake such an effort at exposure in isolation, however.
                            It is far more important to take steps to halt or slow infiltration than
                            to merely complain about it. Further, unless accompanied by positive
                            actions to deter the process, elaborate treatment of the extensive Viet
                            Cong effort and of the support it enjoys from outside would produce
                            negative psychological reactions among the South Vietnamese and probably
                            improve <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> morale.</p>
                        <p>An amorphous world public opinion that is not going to respond in any
                            case to the situation is less important than opinion among the South
                            Vietnamese and the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>Exposure of the infiltration program makes sense only if it is associated
                            with carefully conceived actions for which such exposure would provide
                            part of the political and psychological base. In short, any public
                            diagnosis of this particular disease should be accompanied by a
                            prescription for cure or at least amelioration.</p>
                        <p>If, after considering all factors, we decide that exposure of
                            infiltration is in our interest, we can accomplish it in several
                            ways:</p>
                        <p>1) a fairly full treatment of the kind we did in December 1961 in “A
                            Threat to the Peace”;</p>
                        <p>2) a major speech on the subject by a leading figure in the
                            Government;</p>
                        <p>3) a full-dress statement by Ambassador Stevenson at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>;</p>
                        <p>4) detailed discussion in a Secretarial news conference or in a
                            background session with the press;</p>
                        <p>We might also consider:</p>
                        <p>1) presentation of a detailed case in an appeal for action by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to the International Control
                            Commission</p>
                        <p>2) producing four or five <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> infiltrators
                            for questioning by the press in Saigon or at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The decision whether to use this material in public and, if so, in what
                            manner depends on our purpose. What we say—and where and how—should be
                            determined by what we propose to do about the problem.</p>

                        <p>When you agreed to go to Saigon you took on a hard and demanding
                            assignment in the best tradition of patriotic readiness to serve, and
                            now after four months, the government has been replaced; and a number of
                            Americans have been replaced in accordance with your recommendations.
                            These changes have removed obstacles to victory—but they have not
                            assured it. The picture reported to me by <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, just before Christmas, makes it plain that
                            there is a great deal yet to be done.</p>
                        <p>In the U.S. effort on the spot, by the very nature of things, you must be
                            the man in charge. Your energy and leadership, your active supervision,
                            your insistence on coordinated teamwork in all agencies-these are
                            indispensable to an effective performance by our government in Saigon.
                            And at the same time you yourself are bound to be the symbol and the
                            instrument of American support and American counsel to the <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> government.</p>
                        <p>Some have suggested that there may be some political tension between us
                            because you and I are of different parties. This of course is nonsense.
                            If we can have victory in Viet-Nam there will be praise enough for all
                            of us. So I rely on you to do all in your power to achieve it, and to be
                            alert and demanding in telling all of us in Washington how and what more
                            we can do to help.</p>
                        <p>With my warmest personal regards.</p>

                        <p>Here follows text unclassified letter:</p>
                        <p>Dear General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>:</p>
                        <p>As we enter the New Year of 1964, I want to wish you, your revolutionary
                            government, and your people full success in the long and arduous war
                            which you are waging so tenaciously and bravely against the Viet Cong
                            forces directed and supported by the Communist regime in Hanoi.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> have told me about
                            the serious situation which confronts you and of the plans which you are
                            developing to enable your armed forces and your people to redress this
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>This New Year provides a fitting opportunity for me to pledge on behalf
                            of the American Government and people a renewed partnership with your
                            government and people in your brave struggle for freedom. The United
                            States will continue to furnish you and your people with the fullest
                            measure of support in this bitter fight. We shall maintain in Viet-Nam
                            American personnel and materiel as needed to assist you in achieving
                            victory.</p>
                        <p>Our aims are, I know, identical with yours: to enable your government to
                            protect its people from the acts of terror perpetrated by Communist
                            insurgents from the North. As the forces of your government <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0772"/>become increasingly capable of dealing
                            with this aggression, American military personnel in South Viet-Nam can
                            be progressively withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government shares the view of your government that
                            “neutralization” of South Viet-Nam is unacceptable. As long as the
                            Communist regime in North Viet-Nam persists in its aggressive policy,
                            neutralization of South Viet-Nam would only be another name for a
                            Communist take-over. Peace will return to your country just as soon as
                            the authorities in Hanoi cease and desist from their terrorist
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>Thus, your government and mine are in complete agreement on the political
                            aspects of your war against the forces of enslavement, brutality, and
                            material misery. Within this framework of political agreement we can
                            confidently continue and improve our cooperation.</p>
                        <p>I am pleased to learn from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> about the vigorous operations which you are
                            planning to bring security and an improved standard of living to your
                            people.</p>
                        <p>I wish to congratulate you particularly on your work for the unity of all
                            your people, including the Hoa Hao and Cao Dai, against the Viet Cong. I
                            know from my own experience in Viet-Nam how warmly the Vietnamese people
                            respond to a direct, human approach and how they have hungered for this
                            in their leaders. So again I pledge the energetic support of my country
                            to your government and your people.</p>
                        <p>We will do our full part to ensure that under your leadership your people
                            may win a victory—a victory for freedom and justice and human welfare in
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely, <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>
                        </p>

                        <p>Oral Presentation:</p>
                        <p>When you present the letter to General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> you should also make following points
                            confidentially on behalf of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>:<note n="2" xml:id="d380fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> reported in telegram
                                1242 from Saigon, January 1, that he delivered the letter and made
                                the 11 points to General Minh with General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> present during an interview at
                                10:30 a.m. on January 1. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                                27 VIET S)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. It is vitally important to act now to reverse the trend of the war as
                            rapidly as possible.</p>
                        <p>2. We trust that personnel changes are now virtually complete and that
                            both military commanders and province chiefs can now get down to the job
                            at hand.</p>
                        <p>3. We hope that General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> can
                            designate a Chief of the Joint General Staff and a Commander of the III
                            Corps who will have no other responsibilities and can devote themselves
                            exclusively to these mammoth tasks.</p>
                        <p>4. We assume that, as General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>
                            promised Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will make available sufficient
                            troops in the six key provinces in the III Corps to give its forces the
                            necessary numerical superiority.</p>
                        <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0773"/>
                        <p>5. We have been glad to learn of the stress which General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> places on small-unit actions,
                            particularly in the Mekong Delta. We hope that equal stress will be
                            placed on night actions, both for ambushing Viet Cong and for relieving
                            villages under attack. To win the support of the population it needs to
                            be emphatically demonstrated that the Viet Cong are being beaten
                            precisely at their own game.</p>
                        <p>6. We consider it extremely important that the necessary civil-military
                            coordinating machinery for clear-and-hold operations followed by an
                            effective program to give the villages protection and security be
                            established in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>7. It is likewise extremely important that program directives be issued
                            at an early stage by the central government to lower echelons for proper
                            implementation of all aspects of the program for giving villagers
                            protection.</p>
                        <p>8. We also urge early revitalization of the amnesty program.</p>
                        <p>9. We are encouraged by the exploratory talks which the Vietnamese
                            Government has held with Cambodian Government officials for improving
                            relations between the two countries. We hope that both Governments can
                            proceed to actual negotiations for the settlement of their bilateral
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>10. We accept with pleasure General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>'s invitation to set up an American brain-trust to
                            work with his government and we are prepared to furnish any personnel
                            needed for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>11. General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> can also be sure
                            that he has the complete support of the United States Government as the
                            leader of Viet-Nam. We believe he can magnetically rally the Vietnamese
                            people if he will really try to do so. He should be told leadership is
                            an essential political ingredient of victory such as was the case with
                            Magsaysay in the Philippines.</p>

                                General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>'s January 2
                                speech to Council of Notables represents in sense inaugural address,
                                we wonder whether you are consulting with him on substance. Would
                                seem particularly helpful and appropriate for him to outline in
                                specific concrete terms actions being taken to improve conduct of
                                war and program for attracting support of rural population. Hope you
                                can advise him on this.” (Ibid.)</note> I have already on several
                            occasions explained to General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> the importance of making a major declaration which
                            would clearly and eloquently state aims to remove inequities and
                            grievance and to open up an attractive future. I have also specifically
                            mentioned the question of land reform. He knows my views and has told me
                            that he is going to try to do just this in his January 2 speech. I
                            really do not think it would be suitable for me to dash in on New Year's
                            eve and repeat the advice I have already given. I think it would appear
                            rather breathless and ineffective. I believe he is going to make a real
                            attempt in his speech on January 2, that it is not going to be
                            particularly good, but that it will be a first step, and that I can
                            carry him along a little further when we have our next meeting, which he
                            himself wants to have after, and not before, January 2.</p>

                        <p>There is a People's Republic of the Viet Cong existing within the
                            territorial limits of South Viet Nam. It sits astride the Mekong and
                            Bassac Rivers and extends from the Cambodian border to the China Sea. In
                            other words, it occupies most but not all of the territory known as the
                            Delta Region of Viet Nam beginning only a few miles south of Saigon.</p>
                        <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0776"/>
                        <p>This Viet Cong stronghold has its own governing apparatus, runs its own
                            military establishment, collects taxes, controls the waterways, and in
                            general operates all of this territory with the exception of a few
                            population centers and a few communication highways. It's fastened like
                            an incubus on the peasantry, which in general is passive, but from which
                            it is able to recruit young men who staff its militia and who serve its
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>During the regime of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, no serious effort was
                            made by the Republic of Viet Nam to challenge this Viet Cong state on
                            its own territory. A number of reasons can be advanced for this
                            situation</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> advanced the theory that it was
                            necessary to clean up the easier portions of the Viet Cong threat and
                            establish a firm base before moving on to the more difficult areas.
                            Hence, they concentrated on Northern and Central sections of the
                            Country.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> advanced the theory that the Viet
                            Cong strategy was to gather strength in the Kontum-Pleiku highland area
                            and then drive toward the coastal plains north of Saigon to be cutting
                            the Country in two.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and most of their senior colleagues
                            in their regime came from the North and Central portions of the Country
                            and therefore, concentrated the bulk of their military strength in the
                            protection of their own home land rather than moving on toward the
                            South.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> recognized the strength and ability
                            of the Viet Cong in their stronghold and hesitated to challenge them
                            directly for fear of encountering a catastrophe which would collapse
                            both domestic and international confidence in their regime.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> eventually came to believe
                            that the strategic hamlet concept was the panacea for all problems of
                            subversion and that the application of this concept in the Delta would
                            permit a victory over the Viet Cong in that area without the necessity
                            of a military confrontation.</p>
                        <p>The consequence is, after the overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>,
                            that the Generals find themselves faced with a military problem of vast
                            dimensions which they have not yet begun to tackle. It is not clear from
                            discussions with them whether they feel confident that they can handle
                            the military dimensions of this problem or whether that they hesitate to
                            risk a catastrophe. They say that they expect to begin their campaign in
                            the Southern provinces of the third corps area sometime after the middle
                            of January. We will presumably have to wait until that time to see just
                            what degree of conviction this intention actually entails.</p>
                        <p>At the current moment the situation in these several provinces has gone
                            from bad to worse. Not only have the Viet Cong materially increased the
                            strength of their forces in this area during the immunity allowed them
                            during the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> regime, but they have also profited
                                <pb n="751" xml:id="pg_751" facs="0777"/>from certain mistakes made
                            by that regime. Foremost among these mistakes has been the
                            misapplication of the strategic hamlet program in these provinces.</p>
                        <p>Rather than constructing a hamlet program in connection with a clear and
                            hold military concept, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            directed the rapid elaboration of hamlets in this area in a sort of
                            rapid sweep technique. Because of the nature of the terrain there was a
                            great deal of relocation among families who lived independently near
                            their rice fields. These families were swept up by a rapid military
                            policing movement, concentrated into villages and required to construct
                            the basic rudiments of a fortified strategic hamlet. They were then
                            placed under the “protection” of Republican Youth Groups usually
                            recruited from the central areas of the Country loyal to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and were given to believe that they had achieved
                            security by central government action. In actual fact they were
                            disgruntled because they had been removed from their land, which they
                            had to travel great distances to till, and were more than a little
                            annoyed because the authority of their village elders and family seniors
                            was usurped by young Republican Youth officials for whom they had no
                            respect. </p>
                        <p>In great many instances, therefore, the strategic hamlets were destroyed
                            not by action of the Viet Cong but by the inhabitants themselves. They
                            tore down and burned the villages in which they had been relocated,
                            scattered the Republican Youth and then returned to their land holdings.
                            These disgruntled people have in many instances become assets to the
                            Viet Cong. In any event, they are serious liabilities insofar as any new
                            central government's policy is concerned.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the Generals face the task not only of undertaking a serious
                            military campaign for the first time in this Viet Cong stronghold but,
                            moreover, of attempting to build Government confidence among a peasantry
                            in which that confidence has been severely and bitterly shaken.</p>
                        <p>Compounding immeasurably the complications which the Generals face in the
                            Delta region is the problem of the waterways. It seems clear from all
                            the evidence which was presented in Saigon that the waterways served as
                            a very significant measure of assistance to the Viet Cong. Not only is
                            there considerable evidence of seaborne smuggling into the Mangrove
                            areas at the mouth of the Delta, but also there is evidence of
                            waterborne contraband traffic drifting down from Cambodia into the Viet
                            Cong weapon caches in these provinces. Much of this contraband probably
                            travels legitimately up the Mekong River from the sea in the bottoms of
                            sea-going vessels which have the international right to use this
                            waterway without submission to Vietnamese Government control. Then,
                            however, it is off-loaded (again legitimately) in Phnom Penh from which
                            it is scattered into <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0778"/>country
                            boats which then move down the major waterways (illegally this time)
                            bringing the contraband back into Viet Nam without adequate surveillance
                            or control.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the waterways seem to serve as the traffic arteries for
                            movements of the Viet Cong formations in the paddy country. In many
                            areas, particularly in the Plain of Reeds, the waterways are well
                            overgrown and afford considerable camouflage for protection either from
                            the air or from the lowlands. Again, through control of the waterways,
                            the Viet Cong are able to exact taxes upon the movement of such
                            commodities as rice, fish and charcoal. Vietnamese Government officials
                            themselves ascertain that the Viet Cong extracts as much taxes on these
                            three commodities in that area as does the Vietnamese Government on the
                            same commodities.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, this People's Republic of Viet Cong is a well-established
                            subsisting entity which probably pays its own way, even with regard to
                            the war material which it imports from the outside world. Overlay maps
                            showing the areas which the Viet Cong control in these provinces bear
                            out the statement repeatedly made by General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, Commander-in-Chief of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces, when he said that “We are like an expeditionary
                            force in a hostile territory, holding only a few strong points and
                            maintaining only a few main roads of communication”.</p>
                        <p>This is the challenge which the Generals face in the new year and it is
                            the problem upon which the prestige of the US will stand or fall not
                            only in Viet Nam but in all Southeast Asia. I am convinced that
                            Sihanouk's basic activation in his current frenetic phase derives from
                            his conviction that the Viet Cong are winning in South Viet Nam. I am
                            equally convinced that the Thai, the Burmese, the Indonesians, and
                            others who are nervously awaiting the outcome of the forthcoming
                            military action between the Government of Viet Nam and the People's
                            Republic of Viet Cong will shape much of their future policy on the
                            basis of this battle's outcome. I think we should in no way divert
                            ourselves from the central significance of this one area and this one
                            problem as the key to the entire future of the US position in Southeast
                            Asia.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The General Mood</hi>. The prevailing mood in Saigon,
                            among Americans and Vietnamese, is considerably more pessimistic than I
                            had expected. There is much skepticism about the present and much doubt
                            about the future. One gets the impression of indecision and considerable
                            floundering.</p>
                        <p>In part, the mood can be attributed to the too high expectations
                            generated by the coup and the elimination of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime. All too many people
                            thought that the end of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> rule
                            would solve all their problems. It has not. In many important respects,
                            the situation had worsened not improved, and this has come as a grave
                            disappointment. On the American side, much of the current frustration
                            has been produced by the failure of the new government to act decisively
                            and of the U.S. authorities to stimulate, encourage and support decisive
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>The abrupt exposure of the true situation that had developed throughout
                            the country came as a surprise and shock to many Vietnamese and
                            Americans. Heightened Viet Cong pressure after the coup only deepened
                            the impression of failure and futility for many.</p>
                        <p>There has been all too much concentration on the sins and errors of the
                            past. An inordinate amount of time and effort has gone into exposing,
                            questioning and arresting individuals connected with the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime. I speak here not of the
                            most flagrant violations—murder, torture or large-scale extortion or
                            graft—but of activities no more heinous than those involving some the
                            individuals now in the new government.</p>
                        <p>This raking over the coals of the past has become a national pastime and
                            it has helped to freeze most of the machinery of government. Old grudges
                            are being evened through the medium of anonymous poison-pen letters
                            regarding superiors and the campaign appears directed at all levels of
                            authority—section chiefs, office directors, and ministers alike. As a
                            result, most individuals are concerned about their future and are
                            unwilling to make decisions or to take action on anything but the most
                            routine matters.</p>
                        <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0780"/>
                        <p>In short, there is a good deal of looking to the past and little looking
                            to the future. One gets the impression that considerably more energy is
                            being expended to “correct the evils of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> regime”
                            than to beating the Viet Cong. Some of the specific elements that
                            contribute to the present low state of morale are covered in succeeding
                            sections.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Neutralism</hi>. Talk of neutralism has spread like
                            wildfire through the Vietnamese community. The N.Y Times editorial and
                            Reston and Lippmann columns on the subject were a body blow to morale in
                            Saigon. The equivocal U.S. stand regarding a conference on Cambodian
                            neutrality took on ominous meaning for many Vietnamese. Even high
                            officials asked: are we next? Rumors of French recognition of the
                            Peiping regime added fuel to the flames. The withdrawal of some forces
                            this month and the suggestion we might pull most of our troops out by
                            the end of 1965 were read by some, however mistakenly, as forerunners of
                            a sharp reduction in our commitment.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible to determine how many Vietnamese are thinking of
                            neutralism as a possible solution to their problems. What is most
                            depressing is the growing feeling among them that this may be U.S.
                            policy and that they better be prepared for it. Recent assurances from
                            us have doubtless helped ease the situation but much more needs to be
                            done to counter this line which I gather is being quietly fostered by
                            some of our European friends.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The press</hi>. The drab uniformity and tight controls
                            that dominated the Vietnamese press under <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> have given way to irresponsibility and license
                            under the new regime. New newspapers spring up almost daily. Most of
                            them contain a heavy diet of rumor, scandal and personal vilification.
                            They are further poisoning the atmosphere. Vietnamese with even the
                            remotest connection with the old Government read the newspapers with
                            trepidation about what might be written about them.</p>
                        <p>In part, fear of criticism in the foreign press has inclined the new
                            government to lean over backwards as regards press freedom. Also, there
                            is some suspicion that those with power over the press are using it
                            selectively against preferred targets. In any case, the performance of
                            the press has not improved matters greatly and some better balance
                            between freedom and license is urgently needed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The new leaders</hi>. One gets the impression of a
                            group of largely honorable men, working hard and desperately looking for
                            solutions to their country's problems. One also gets the impression of
                            men largely unqualified by experience to deal with many of the problems
                            facing them.</p>
                        <p>They are working overtime to preserve the essentials of collective
                            leadership. They appear fearful of the consequences if they become torn
                            by internal rivalries and the competition of cliques. They therefore <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0781"/>spend an inordinate amount of
                            time meeting together to keep each other informed of what is going on
                            and to reach decisions collectively. Even relatively minor decisions
                            occupy the time of the Revolutionary Committee. And the rest of the
                            governmental machine awaits guidance from the committee before taking
                            any action.</p>
                        <p>The Committee is reluctant to delegate authority; lower officials are
                            reluctant to act on their own initiative. The result—stagnation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Need for a Program</hi>. The new Government came into
                            power with a fairly good idea of what it was against, what it didn't
                            like about the former regime. But it has yet to produce any clearly
                            defined program of action setting forth what it wants or what it
                            proposes to do. Virtually nothing has come from the Revolutionary
                            Committee that stirs enthusiasm and excitement, that could enlist the
                            hearty support of its own people in Saigon or in the countryside, to say
                            nothing of wooing adherents away from the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>The stock Vietnamese reply when this question is raised is to say: You
                            Americans are too impatient. Yet talks with many Vietnamese made it
                            quite clear that they, too, felt deeply the lack of a positive program
                            of action aimed at bringing peace in freedom to their country.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Mobilization of Resources</hi>. The new authorities in
                            Saigon have done fairly well in ridding the country of some of the
                            deadwood of the past, of incompetents and lackeys whose only virtue was
                            political conformity. But at the same time, they have failed to use
                            fully some of the competence and skill available from the pre-November
                            period. There has been a certain amount of change for the sake of change
                            and consequent waste of experience.</p>
                        <p>Some people in the above category and others who might conceivably
                            represent a threat in the future are being shipped abroad to relatively
                            unimportant posts. Others whose experience and training are desperately
                            needed in Saigon are being permitted to go or to stay abroad.</p>
                        <p>Almost nothing has been done thus far to enlist the enthusiasm and
                            support of the youth, many of whom are highly motivated. The idea of a
                            domestic peace corps, for example, hasn't gotten off the ground. The one
                            man who had made a deliberate effort to win the support of young people
                            has been General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>, and there
                            is some question as to his long-range purpose in this effort. Nor has
                            there been any well-conceived effort to channel the energies and
                            intelligence of the politically conscious religious groups, especially
                            the young Buddhists.</p>
                        <p>All this represents a tragic waste of energy, talent and experience which
                            a country like Viet Nam desperately needs. The danger is that those who
                            want to help and who now feel left out will move in directions inimical
                            to the major task facing their country, becoming a divisive rather than
                            constructive force.</p>
                        <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0782"/>
                        <p>US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Relations. The coup launched a new
                            era in U.S. relations with the Vietnamese. No American's prestige is or
                            has been higher than that of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. He is credited with encouraging the welcome
                            change of November 1 and with having genuine sympathy for Viet Nam's
                            problems. His word carries great weight and his advice is welcomed.</p>
                        <p>A very real problem, however, is that the Ambassador is one man and there
                            are but 24 hours in a day. No one man can possibly keep abreast of the
                            wide range of problems facing the new Government in Saigon and be
                            prepared to offer constructive advice and suggestions on them. Moreover,
                            the Vietnamese are extremely proud and they are not going to go to the
                            American Embassy every hour or every day seeking ideas or advice.</p>
                        <p>Somehow, the gulf between their receptivity and our availability must be
                            bridged.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Conclusions</hi>. There is a most serious morale
                            problem in Viet Nam. There is some weariness and a diminution of
                            optimism about the future. There is entirely too much preoccupation with
                            the mistakes and wrongs of the past; too little action and planning
                            aimed at the future.</p>
                        <p>Too much time, energy, experience, and drive is being wasted or ill-used.
                            There is a lack of imagination in developing and presenting a program
                            that would capture the support of the people. There is some concern
                            about U.S. policies and intentions and firmness. There is too cumbersome
                            a machine for decision making. There is an absence of broad guidance
                            from the center and, at the same time, too little willingness to
                            encourage local initiative or, at the other end, to accept it.</p>
                        <p>There is a need for some immediate successes, however few and however
                            modest. This would help alter the present mood of discouragement. But
                            Viet Nam's needs and the promotion of our interests there call for
                            actions that are both broader and deeper in scope than a few successful
                            military actions in a war that is primarily social and political.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Some Suggestions for Action.</p>
                        <p>The most desperate need in Saigon right now is for clear, forceful and
                            imaginative leadership. The second most urgent requirement is for an
                            enlightened and thoughtful program that would capture the imagination
                            and support of the people.</p>
                        <p>This is no time for traditional approaches or routine solutions. The
                            situation is too important and too fragile. We are going to have to
                            display great imagination and skill.</p>
                        <p>I see little prospect of meeting the current problem unless we do
                            something: alone the following lines:</p>
                        <pb n="757" xml:id="pg_757" facs="0783"/>
                        <p>We need a small team, perhaps six to eight men, who know the Viet Nam
                            scene, have a real appreciation of the problems, who are totally devoted
                            to the cause of preserving the country's independence, and who have
                            demonstrated skill in working with the Vietnamese. They must have tact,
                            patience and a passion for anonymity. They should be individuals who
                            through past contacts have developed ties of trust and confidence with
                            the Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>These men should be assigned on a man-for-man basis to work with the
                            leading figures in the present Government in Saigon-<persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName>, Oai, and possibly <persName corresp="#p_XUAN1">Xuan</persName>. They should be available 24
                            hours a day to give advice, advance ideas, make suggestions. They should
                            work in closely coordinated fashion with common goals in mind and the
                            advancement of our common policies as their main objective. One man
                            should act as team director and coordinator and the entire operation
                            should be under the close supervision of the Ambassador. The group would
                            carry out the Ambassador's directions and would keep him fully informed
                            of all significant developments.</p>
                        <p>The most urgent requirements for such a group would be:</p>
                        <p>to promote more clearly defined leadership, probably in the person of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> and possibly
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>;</p>
                        <p>to encourage development of a thoughtful action program, with emphasis on
                            political and social action;</p>
                        <p>to take a hard look at existing programs and revise or eliminate as
                            necessary;</p>
                        <p>to win the support and cooperation of key elements—government officials,
                            intellectuals, youth, religious groups, the peasants;</p>
                        <p>to encourage initiative within the government and particularly at the
                            province and district levels;</p>
                        <p>to promote an amnesty for those who made mistakes under <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>—major crimes excepted—and to
                            judge people on present and future performance;</p>
                        <p>to shift emphasis from the defensive posture of the past to aggressive
                            action against the enemy;</p>
                        <p>to overhaul and revitalize the information and psychological programs
                            directed at the people of South Viet Nam and at the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>As regards the kind of men who could carry out this kind of assignment
                            with skill and imagination, I would suggest the following:</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LMGEG1">Ed Lansdale</persName>-he knows as much
                            about Viet Nam, about this kind of political action and about the key
                            figures in Saigon as almost any living American. He has prestige and
                            influence with many of the central figures in the country. He has
                            talents, clearly demonstrated in Viet Nam and the Philippines' which are
                            urgently needed and which, in my opinion, we would waste only to our own
                            disadvantage. In this critical situation, bureaucratic rivalries and
                            jealousies must be forgotten. Ed can do a job that desperately needs
                            doing.</p>
                        <pb n="758" xml:id="pg_758" facs="0784"/>
                        <p>Lou Conein—experienced and able, he has unparalleled standing with some
                            of the generals, particularly <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>; he is listened to with respect and can get things
                            done.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Rufe Phillips</persName>—the key figure in
                            the rural affairs program in Viet Nam, imaginative, energetic, and the
                            confidant of such men as <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KCJR1">Jim Kent</persName>—now in <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>, a military man with previous service
                            in Viet Nam, quiet, solid, and with a deep understanding of what is
                            going on; stands well with some of the generals now in power.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">Joe Mendenhall</persName>-a political
                            officer now in <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>, knows Viet Nam,
                            understands the Vietnamese, able and imaginative and devoted to Viet
                            Nam's freedom.</p>
                        <p>These are but some of the men who come to mind for the kind of rough task
                            I have outlined. There are others. The final choice should be the
                            Ambassador's with the team leader, preferably Lansdale, having a voice
                            in selection. Obviously, those picked for such a job would have to trust
                            each other and work well together. And they would have to move forward
                            with the greatest skill, finesse, and subtlety. It would be the most
                            challenging kind of assignment—but it could mean the difference between
                            success and failure. It is a risk worth taking.</p>
