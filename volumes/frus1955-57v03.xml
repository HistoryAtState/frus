                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    Government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>

                    Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of State. The
                    editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in accordance
                    with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary of State
                        <persName>Frank B. Kellogg</persName> on March 26, 1925.</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in
                    the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                    concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list>

                        <p>Chinese People’s Government announced July 31st that in accordance
                            Chinese legal procedure eleven Air Force personnel had <pb n="2"

                            They due Hong Kong August 4. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>
                            said his Government hopes this action will have favorable effects on
                            present talks. He then quoted from agreed statement both Governments of
                            July 25 and added he sincerely hoped talks would continue ease tension
                            between US and China. Expressed conviction that with joint effort it
                            should be possible achieve this highly significant goal. Referring to
                            consular talks held during past year, he declared that although results
                            not entirely satisfactory he was sure I would agree that appreciation
                            should be expressed to consular representatives both sides for their
                            efforts. He said that so long as both sides adopt an attitude of
                            conciliation it should not be difficult reach a solution of return of
                            civilians of both sides.</p>
                        <p>He added that talks should not be confined to above question because
                            number of other issues exist between China and US. <persName

                            press any information whatever concerning these talks except in
                            agreement with each other or after prior notification to each other.</p>

                            and that he was glad note there was no difference of opinion regarding

                                    spectacularly grabbed propaganda ball” and that it seemed
                                    probable “<gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s are going
                                    to move fast and early on civilians as they are playing for big
                                    game.” He stated that while the release of the fliers “enables
                                    me maintain position can be no discussion ‘other practical
                                    matters’ until <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s agree

                        <p>At his press conference on August 2, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied to a series of questions
                            concerning the Ambassadorial talks in Geneva. In response to a question
                            as to what he had in mind in speaking of a possible “cease-fire”, he
                            commented as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“What we hope to arrive at by progressive steps is a situation
                                    where the Chinese Communists will have renounced the use of
                                    force to achieve their ambitions. That is the thing I have been
                                    emphasizing and driving at for months because, if they are not
                                    willing to do that, if they want to use force to achieve their
                                    ambitions, that will almost surely start up a war the limits of
                                    which could not be defined in advance. How that is brought about
                                    I don’t know. That is a matter of policy for the Chinese
                                    Communists. I don’t know how they will choose to make that
                                    clear, if indeed they do make it clear. I already have said that
                                    the speech of <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                                    of last Friday [<hi rend="italic">Saturday, July 30</hi>] went
                                    further in that direction than anything that he has yet said. I
                                    hope that what is taking place either at Geneva or outside of
                                    Geneva, and the whole trend of world events, will create a
                                    situation <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0034"/>so that we can
                                    feel that we are not under the threat of war from the situation
                                    in that area. I said in my press conference of April 26, you may
                                    remember, that the United States was not willing to negotiate
                                    with a pistol at its head; that the first thing to do is to find
                                    out whether there was a threat of war there because, if that was
                                    the case, then as far as the United States is concerned it would
                                    be quite impossible to negotiate these practical matters.</p>
                                <p>“I pointed out last week that a number of things had happened
                                    which indicated that the pistol had been laid down and that it
                                    made it possible to try to clear up now some of these practical
                                    matters between us. But the important thing is that the pistol
                                    should be permanently discarded, and we hope that the trend of
                                    events will bring reassurance on that point.”</p></quote></p>

                                    of our friends when our friends are absent. We count the
                                    Nationalists on Formosa as our friends. We are not going to
                                    discuss their future or their destiny or anything about them
                                    until they are there.”</p></quote></p>
                        <p>When asked if he would favor a summit meeting with all parties concerned
                            to settle Asian tensions, he replied: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I think not at this time. I think it would be far too much in
                                    advance to talk about the possibility of a summit meeting. They
                                    have implications that do not follow upon meetings at a somewhat
                                    lower level.</p>
                                <p>“Now, I believe the Secretary has said that it is within the

                                    negotiations possibly on ministerial level, but I think nothing
                                    further has been hinted at.”</p></quote></p>

                        <p>244. Second meeting with Chinese held August 2, 10 a.m. I led off with
                            statement on Americans detained in China. I expressed deep concern of
                            American people at continued detention of civilians pointing out many
                            imprisoned over four years and others under house arrest or denied exit
                            permits. I said despite my government’s efforts through various channels
                            and direct talks initiated by <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>
                            and me last year and continued at consular level results have not been
                            entirely satisfactory as <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>
                            himself stated yesterday. At least 36 American civilians still detained
                            in China mostly in prison. I emphasized this causes continued deep
                            concern to American people and inevitably heavily influences attitude of
                            American people and government toward <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName>’s government. I handed <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName> list of 36 American civilians. I continued that
                            although gratified at release 11 Air Force personnel I must in all
                            frankness stress that only release of all Americans both civilian and
                            military detained by <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s
                            government would serve dispel ill feeling existing in US over this issue
                            and bring about atmosphere permitting fruitful discussion other
                            practical matters. I then told <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName> I was aware his government’s interest in discussing
                            question of some Chinese civilians in US. Said I would be glad hear his
                            views.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> replied he had noted my
                            statement, that he would answer some questions raised there this morning
                            and others later. Then proceeded read prepared statement “status of
                            American nationals from our viewpoint” as follows:</p>
                        <p>American nationals treated like all other aliens in China and accorded
                            protection so long as they respect Chinese law. If they breach Chinese
                            law treated as law provides.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said his government had been
                            informing US from time to time of status Americans in China and was now
                            willing advise US once again of status of Americans and measures they
                            intended to take out of special consideration. Classified Americans in
                            four categories: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>42 ordinary Americans. This includes those who had applied to
                                    leave China and those who had not. Those under this category may
                                    apply and leave any time provided they not involved in
                                    unfinished cases. Chinese government is now reviewing cases
                                    those who applied and will advise results later.</item>

                                    early release. Out of humanitarian considerations Chinese
                                    government will allow relatives these persons visit them.

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> then took up question Chinese
                            nationals in US. Said great majority these have families on China
                            mainland. For long time due American government restrictions and
                            practical difficulties these nationals unable freely return home join
                            families. This is pressing question demanding solution, one which
                            Chinese government always concerned about.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> continued both sides had
                            concretely discussed question freedom Chinese nationals including
                            students at Geneva during past year. On four occasions US had informed
                            his government of Chinese leaving US. Of 27 such persons mentioned on
                            first three occasions, six have still not returned to China. On fourth
                            occasion, April 8, 1955, US representative stated 76 Chinese permitted
                            leave but no name list given so impossible verify whether they have
                            returned. There have not been necessary improvements in return of
                            nationals including students from US. <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName> said might as well point out that when his side
                            issued exit permits to 27 Americans they always prompt and concrete in
                            informing US.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> stated they recently informed
                            that US Immigration Service notified many students they must leave US
                            not later than September sixth and that those failing depart by that
                            date were advised apply for permanent residence under Refugee Relief Act
                            of 1953.<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3">Approved August 7, 1953; 67 Stat.

                            problems. As result many may not be able leave in time and no choice but
                            apply for permanent residence which will increase difficulties their

                            deeply concerned over fate nationals. On basis mutual conciliation and

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> expressed hope we would give
                            his proposals due consideration.</p>
                        <p>I replied I wanted study his proposals carefully and would give him
                            detailed reply later. In meantime however I wanted to state that concern
                            his government regarding Chinese students in US appears largely on
                            misunderstanding of true situation. I said I was authorized formally
                            assure him US imposing no restraints on Chinese civilians in US desiring
                            proceed territory under control his government. I repeated that I could
                            formally and categorically say to him that no Chinese student was being
                            prevented from leaving US. I asked if he knew any Chinese student
                            prevented from departing he let me know and I would have case
                            investigated at once. I expressed hope in such event he would give me as
                            much data as possible on each case just as I had done regarding cases of
                            Americans detained in China.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> replied he would carefully
                            study all I had said and reply at later meeting. He then proposed that
                            since discussions had entered concrete stage meetings be held as a rule
                            only every other day unless special reasons demanded more or less
                            frequent meetings. I agreed to this proposal.</p>
                        <p>Referring to my proposal not to release information to press without
                            prior agreement <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said he had
                            given matter careful study and agreed in principle. Said if any
                            statement considered necessary by either side agreement should be
                            reached with other or prior notification given. In this way discussions
                            could be completely frank and informal.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> I pleased he agreed
                            with me that adoption this procedure would contribute to frankness and
                            informality of discussions. I suggested that any prior notification give

                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> concurred in this.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> then proposed we inform press
                            we had discussed first item of agenda and that next meeting to be held
                            August 4, 10 a.m. I agreed proposing we say nothing else concerning
                            meeting to which <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>I said I presumed <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> would concur
                            that both governments should share equally cost of meeting room.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said that was reasonable
                            arrangement and he felt cost unimportant compared with results talks
                            might achieve.</p>

                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> said, in

                            both Democrats and Republicans in the House on a policy of caution, as
                            regards Red China. There was a general feeling that <persName

                        <p>He said that there was a general feeling in the House that I was somewhat
                            less disposed than either the President or <persName corresp="#p_GSWF1"
                                >Senator George</persName> to move toward friendly relations with
                            Communist China; that he realized that if this were the case, I was in a
                            difficult spot but that I should know that the House of Representatives
                            was virtually unanimous in supporting what they considered to be my
                            position.</p>
                        <p>I said that I did feel that <persName corresp="#p_GSWF1">Senator

                                    his manner seemed slightly apologetic as I referred to what he

                            I said that so far as the President was concerned there never had been

                                additional division would ‘substantially’ diminish the defensibility
                                of Taiwan and the Pescadores” and requested that the Joint Chiefs of

                        <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that while the movement of one

                        </list>
                        <p>I said that I wanted to review with the President the basic thinking now
                            underlying what I was doing in relation to Communist China as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> was absolutely opposed to
                            giving up Quemoy and the Matsus. He believed that this withdrawal would
                            be disastrous, and whether or not we agreed with his reasoning we had to
                            accept the fact of his present position.</p>
                        <p>These coastal islands are militarily untenable by the Nationalists
                            without large U.S. assistance. We do not desire to have to get into a
                            major war with China, and indeed it is doubtful that the President has
                            authority to use the armed forces of the United States in defense of
                            Quemoy and the Matsus, if, as increasingly appears, the Chinese <pb
                                n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0044"/>Communists themselves distinguish
                            between Quemoy and the Matsus and our treaty area.</p>
                        <p>However, to allow Quemoy and the Matsus to be taken by the Communists and
                            to allow large Nationalist forces to be destroyed there would have a
                            grave effect upon morale in Korea, Japan, Formosa, the Philippines and
                            Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the Department had to find diplomatic means through which to
                            prevent a Chinese Communist attack.</p>
                        <p>We had started on this program prior to the Bandung Conference and had
                            moved that program forward at Bandung. That had produced <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s offer to talk with us, and
                            after three months used up by talks with intermediaries, we had
                            responded by setting up the bilateral talks at Geneva for limited
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>We were using the time thus gained to try to build up a world opinion
                            which would compel the Chinese Communists to accept the status quo and
                            not seek to change it by force. This was a result which we could hope to
                            achieve since the position we sought was basically the same position
                            that the rest of the world takes with respect to the non-use of force to
                            unify such areas as Germany, Korea, Vietnam, and indeed Ireland.</p>
                        <p>I referred to President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s
                            recent statement of intention to incorporate certain tracts north of the
                            armistice line into South Korea.<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">Reference is
                                to a statement issued by the Republic of Korea on August 2.</note> I
                            said that his logic in wanting it was even more powerful than that of
                            the Chinese Communists in wanting to incorporate Quemoy and the Matsus
                            with their areas. However, we had made clear that we would not be
                            acquiescent in <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s use of force
                            for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>This was the general line I had taken in my breakfast talk with <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> at Geneva<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d9fn3">On July 22; see <ref target="frus1955-57v02#d314"

                            and it was a line which I had taken in my last two press
                                conferences<note n="4" xml:id="d9fn4">On July 26 (see <ref

                                    Document 319</ref>) and August 2 (see <ref target="#d3">Document
                                    3</ref>).</note> and I felt that we were making some
                            headway.</p>
                        <p>As to the talks at Geneva, I said that we were not anxious to push them
                            to a conclusion except as to getting out our civilians who are being
                            subjected to inhuman treatment. Otherwise, we needed time by which to
                            stabilize the situation.</p>
                        <p>I said that I had no desire or present intention to have talks with
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>. This thought had
                            been injected into the scene by <persName corresp="#p_GSWF1">Senator
                                George</persName> and it was difficult to get it out because it was
                            one of those eventualities which was impossible to deal with on a “never
                            never” basis but which when not dealt with on that basis left open a
                            crack which many tried to press wider open.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that he was aware of and in full accord with this
                            program and that he welcomed this opportunity to have a <pb n="17"
                                xml:id="pg_17" facs="0045"/>quiet chat about it. He remarked that he
                            always tried to handle his press conferences so as to avoid putting any
                            spokes into my diplomatic efforts. I said that I had great admiration
                            for the skill with which he handled his press conferences.</p>

                                <p>“Therefore tactic which I had planned prior to receipt <gloss

                                    My hope was that without necessarily freezing on any particular

                            U.S. will take further step of authorizing Indian Embassy in U.S. to

                            to transmit funds for this purpose. Indian Embassy may publicly make

                                <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> grievances re students.
                            Said up to now some students continue be prevented leave, citing in
                            great detail case of Dr. <persName>Tsien</persName>, Cal Tech Rocket
                            Expert. Claimed latter wrote Peiping authorities June 15, appealing

                            him last meeting who he said not yet returned China. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> also made familiar allegations

                        <p>I replied various points, stressing repeatedly restrictions on Chinese
                            students, including Dr. <persName>Tsien</persName>, now rescinded and
                            all without exception free depart if desire. As result my reiteration no
                            restrictions against departure and contrasting with situation Americans
                            in China <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> shifted emphasis to
                            “practical” difficulties faced by students saying while these
                            restrictions may have been lifted practical difficulties mounted to
                            restraint on students. Way to solve these difficulties was to have third
                            country look after affairs Chinese nationals in United States.</p>

                                    was considering the following arrangement:</p>
                                <p>“Indian Embassy Washington could receive requests from any

                                    Indian Embassy would give full publicity. British Embassy in
                                    China would perform same services for American nationals there,

                            Americans in China emphasizing US expected all US civilians be released

                            taken by Chinese. Explicit information concerning measures being taken
                            this regard “would facilitate and expedite discussions.”</p>

                                >Robertson</persName>. In considering future course these talks and
                            our broad objectives I offer following thought.</p>
                        <p>Present context, particularly in public mind is that talks are in nature
                            conference with definitive ending at some point in time. It seems to me
                            some of difficulties inherent this context would be obviated if and when
                            we reach “other practical matters” we could gradually shift to concept
                            of contact between <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> and myself
                            being of indefinite duration in time and intermittent in nature to be
                            utilized at request either side.</p>
                        <p>Although possibly presenting some new difficulties I think this concept
                            would best meet our broad objective without difficulties inherent in
                            concept attempting prolong present series of talks.</p>
                        <p>I realize this is largely question of form rather than substance but
                            believe it important.</p>
                        <p>What I have in mind is that at some point in discussion “other practical
                            matters” I would attempt obtain agreement that instead of meeting more
                            or less regularly with recesses of varying lengths we would meet only at
                            request of other to be transmitted through Consulates General here.</p>
                        <p>There could be gradual press preparation for this and I would take
                            advantage any opportunity prepare <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName>.</p>
                        <p>While this has advantages must recognize retains disadvantages present
                            situation in heavy public attention whenever <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName> and I would appear here. However do not perceive
                            any practicable alternative as long as <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName> and I remain point of contact.<note n="2"

                            The Chinese Government was uneasy over the apparent possibility of a
                            high level meeting with the Chinese Communists. The Ambassador was
                            instructed by his Government to state that it would look with strong
                            disfavor on any meeting between the American Government and the Chinese
                            Communists at the Foreign Minister level. He said he would be very
                            gratified if he could be given a confirmation that no such meeting is in
                            prospect.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that there was
                            no change whatever in the American position on this. The situation was
                            the same as when the Secretary held his press conference. There was no
                            likelihood of such a meeting then, and there was none now.</p>

                            forth in the instructions, and there were no instructions beyond those
                            which had been paraphrased in [<hi rend="italic">for</hi>] the Chinese

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that his

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said there had been
                            no tangible progress so far on the question of the release of the
                            American civilians. The main purpose of the talks was to get our people
                            out. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang Ping-nan</persName> was trying to
                            make an issue of alleged interference with the travel to the mainland of
                            Chinese students in this country. These allegations as to restrictions
                            on Chinese in this country were balderdash. It was only propaganda,
                            since the Chinese students actually are free to move about in this
                            country and to leave the U.S. if they wish. We do not want any Communist
                            sympathizers here as permanent residents. They are more than welcome to
                            go to the mainland if they want to.</p>

                            pointed out that the great majority of Chinese students in this country
                            have been assisted and protected by the Chinese Government and its
                            Embassy and Consulates in this country and that the students are loyal
                            to their Government and still look to it for representation of their
                            interests. They give their allegiance to the Chinese Government and not
                            to the Chinese Communists. It is presumptuous deception for the Chinese
                            Communists to pretend that Chinese in this country should look to the
                            Communist regime for protection and representation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said we had noted
                            the Chinese Embassy statement and had sent it to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>. He considered it a very good
                            statement. He remarked that we know that the Chinese in this country,
                            with very few exceptions, maintain their fidelity to the Chinese
                            Government. We are aware that the Chinese Government has helped many of
                            them with scholarships, travel arrangements and so on, and that
                            practically all of them came to this country on Chinese Nationalist
                            passports. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> remarked
                            that there is no such thing as an exit visa in this country and
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang Ping-nan</persName>’s allegations at
                            Geneva that “exit visas” had been denied was nonsense.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that he hoped
                            the American Government would never admit even tacitly any degree of
                            Communist jurisdiction over the general body of Chinese students and
                            other nationals in this country.</p>
                        <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0052"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said the Ambassador
                            need have no fear on this score. The Communists would not be allowed to
                            establish any contact except with those who of their own volition stated
                            that they wanted to go back to the mainland.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> mentioned that those
                            few students who wanted to go back might have some difficulty in paying
                            for their passage. The United States Government did not propose to pay
                            their way back to Communist territory. However, we were not standing in
                            the way. Anyone who wants to go to a Communist country can go—the sooner
                            the better.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> mentioned that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> had informed
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Tan</persName> on July 29 that some
                            third party such as India or Great Britain might be designated to assist
                            the Chinese students who want to return to the mainland.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said some Embassy
                            might conceivably be the medium for handling travel funds and making
                            other arrangements for the return of those who expressed a wish to go
                            back.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> remarked that this
                            arrangement would imply no official representation of Chinese Communist
                            interests in this country, since the Embassy role would be that of a
                            travel expediter.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> reverted to the
                            subject of a possible conference with Communist China at the Foreign
                            Minister level. He said that his Government would appreciate a more
                            definite statement or formal assurance that no such meeting was
                            contemplated. The Secretary’s statement of last week was most welcome
                            and President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had said
                            that he associated himself with the statement of the Secretary of
                                State.<note n="5" xml:id="d14fn5">It is not clear which statements
                                by the Secretary and the President are referred to here, but see

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said the President
                            and the Secretary had stated most emphatically that this Government
                            would not discuss, on any level, matters affecting the rights of the
                            Government of the Republic of China. He felt there could be no objection
                            to bilateral talks aimed at securing the freedom of our nationals who
                            are held. If there should be any international conference on Far Eastern
                            subjects where matters involving the rights of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> were to be discussed, “your Government
                            would have to be there”, or give its concurrence. Nothing could be
                            decided “without your presence or your concurrence”.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said his
                            Government would appreciate a more formal assurance on the lack of any
                            intention of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> to
                            meet with <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>. He wondered
                            if his Government could obtain a memorandum on the subject.</p>
                        <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0053"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he did not
                            think there was any question of a memorandum. Both the President and the
                            Secretary of State have stated their position to the American people and
                            to the world. He felt this was as explicit and as binding as anyone
                            could wish.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said it was true
                            that very satisfactory statements had been made, but they were rather
                            informal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> observed that they
                            were categorical and were on the record. He did not see how they could
                            have more force or more effect. He offered to send the Ambassador a copy
                            of the press conference.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he already had the record of the press conference. He
                            needed something more formal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he felt that
                            what had been said could not be more official. A public affirmation of
                            our position before all the world was better than a classified
                            communication. It put the whole world on notice what our position
                            was.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said his
                            Government did find much assurance in the statements of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> himself, the Secretary, the
                            President and the American Chargé in Taipei. They had all made it clear
                            that there would be no talks involving the essential interests of the
                            Chinese Government without its presence or concurrence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he could
                            reaffirm that no matter would be taken up with the Chinese Communists
                            which involved the rights of the Republic of China without the presence
                            or concurrence of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> asked if that
                            would still be the U.S. position if talks with the Peiping regime at the
                            Foreign Minister level should ever be held.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said yes, that was
                            correct, in the unlikely event that such talks should sometime be held.
                            He remarked that discussions at that level were no closer now than they
                            had been when the Secretary was asked about this subject at his press
                            conference.</p>

                                stated that he planned, if necessary, to suggest a “fairly prolonged

                                Americans’ “. He noted that decisions would have to be made at some
                                point as to the degree of performance which would be considered
                                sufficient for an agreement on representation, although he did not
                                think this decision could or should be made immediately, and as to

                                    the principle of free return since “substantially all Americans

                                    was unable to say that the United States would permit Chinese
                                    who had committed crimes to depart. He had, therefore, been
                                    “attempting to keep discussion within framework practical

                        <p>418. Following are our general observations thus far. While <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> has been bargaining hard he has
                            been avoiding uncompromising and extreme positions usually taken by
                            Communist negotiators. At today’s meeting in particular his review of my
                            previous statements was notably accurate and devoid of usual attempts at
                            distortion and misrepresentation. In fact he seemed entirely to accept
                            my previous statements as meeting the requests embodied in his points
                            two and three and while mentioning point one in effect dropped it. He is
                            acting much more in tradition of old time Chinese bargainer than
                            Communist diplomat.</p>
                        <p>He has almost completely avoided usual Communist cliches and language as
                            interpreted by his translator which is basis reports our messages tends
                            be considerably more brittle than in original Chinese.</p>
                        <p>He is uniformly courteous at meetings and I now have definite impression
                            from manner as well as substance that they desire reach agreements.<note

                                    into his conciliatory approach than you may be inclined to do
                                    from there. The semblance of reasonableness and willingness to
                                    go part way may be recognizable, but when his draft agreement is
                                    taken apart there is really nothing in the way of tangible
                                    concession at all. There is as yet no assurance that the Chinese
                                    Communist position on the Americans is any different from what
                                    it was last year. Undoubtedly they would be willing to release
                                    the Americans in return for the sort of broad representation
                                    arrangement which they are seeking. But a concession on this
                                    from us is not to be expected. In the absence of a complete
                                    yielding by us on the representation issue, can any substantial
                                    ‘give’ by the Communists on the detained Americans really be
                                    expected? Maybe so, but there is as yet nothing we can rely

                                possibly it is sufficient to drop out reference to 90 days and

                                that all American nationals in Communist China who desire to return

                            point, however, we feel it may be necessary to submit a concrete
                            proposal in form which could be subsequently made public in the event

                        <p>448. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> opened this morning’s
                            meeting with statement that if I would immediately agree upon his draft
                            agreement he would before announcement thereof made give me and publicly
                            release results review those cases Americans both prisoners and exit
                            permit cases in which review completed. Was clear to us that “review”
                            not “completed” cases all Americans. In context satisfied “completion of
                            reviews” meant release but was unable obtain any indication number.</p>
                        <p>During course much give and take there was strong implication that he was
                            probably prepared accept my original formulation for third party
                            representation.</p>
                        <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0062"/>
                        <p>During course give and take I also obtained from him categorical
                            statement that cases all Americans including category (d) his August 2
                            list (Downey and Fecteau) being “reviewed”.</p>
                        <p>In reply I referred again to measures taken by US Government permit
                            departure Chinese, our categorical assurances none prevented from
                            departing and stated I had hoped results of “review” on Chinese side
                            would permit him make same statement to me, that is no American desiring
                            return being detained. I stressed inequality of situation and expressed
                            disappointment early settlement forecast by <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou En-lai</persName> had not materialized. I could not consider
                            agenda item one settled until all Americans able return.</p>
                        <p>I then commented on draft agreement stating our original formulation
                            fully and adequately meets situation and that provision for
                            “investigation upon request of government” entirely unnecessary. I said
                            I was not in position accept draft agreement or its present form and
                            reserved right for further comment.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> then pressed me to state any
                            other objections. In reply I pointed out second sentence first paragraph
                            his draft offered nothing to Americans detained in China.</p>
                        <p>I then outlined our thoughts on form of simultaneous unilateral
                            statements giving as rationale those matters “concerned internal
                            affairs” each country. I said any statement we made would include
                            categorical statements I had made to him during course of meeting on
                            freedom Chinese depart from US together with whatever arrangements made
                            for third party representations. I said I would expect any statement
                            from his side to include whatever action they had taken with regard to
                            Americans and that I would hope and expect it would include categorical
                            statement similar to that we have made concerning departure Chinese
                            together with arrangements for third party representation. I said this
                            was my tentative thinking at the moment not a formal proposal but that I
                            would embody my thoughts into a specific proposal at our next meeting.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> strongly resisted concept
                            saying it would show we had not been able agree. I pointed out that need
                            not be case, that he had perhaps misunderstood my concept which was that
                            the unilateral statements of which the other would take note would be
                            released by joint agreement. He would not agree to concept, pushing hard
                            for “joint announcement” along lines July 25 statement and our agreement

                        <p>I shared <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s concern over amount
                            of time spent agenda item one pointing out it could have immediately and
                            expeditiously been resolved by release all Americans in China. This
                            would have “laid sound basis” upon which we could enter into mutually
                            acceptable agreement on third party representation and permit fruitful
                            discussion other practical matters.</p>

                        <p>457. Developments at today’s meeting show that our tactics of keeping
                            representation arrangement as bait for release Americans has paid
                            dividends. (I carefully avoided at today’s meeting asking “how many” as
                            such a question could not have been put without weakening stand on
                            release of all.)</p>
                        <p>Question we now clearly face is whether we can or should pursue this
                            tactic further.</p>
                        <p>We all have strong impression from today’s meeting that it will not be
                            possible further to advance position we have gained without great
                            difficulty and much time.</p>
                        <p>Question therefore is what approach is going to get most Americans out in
                            shortest time. Related to this is question whether we are justified in
                            taking action which will result those Americans whose release we can now
                            obtain remaining in prison because we strive to obtain simultaneous
                            release larger number or all of them. I refrain from commenting on
                            coldblooded attitude <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s which
                            has brought about this situation but simply say it is fact we must face
                            in dealing with these people however distasteful it may be.</p>
                        <p>We have carefully discussed among ourselves all aspects problem and have
                            come conclusion that course in best overall interests detained Americans
                            is to reach some agreement on representation at present point.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First we strongly feel that I would not in forseeable future be
                                able to move Chinese off of legalistic approach to individual
                                American cases. They are not going take simultaneous action on cases
                                all Americans which would jeopardize their ability maintain public
                                pretense action is result workings “justice”. I have tried hard
                                avoid backing them into comer where they could not do this and
                                believe <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0064"/>any other course
                                would only indefinitely delay release of any Americans regardless
                                strength Chinese desire get ahead to item two.</item>
                            <item>Second we believe that after release of first group we will be
                                able maintain steady pressure for release of remainder during course
                                talks on “other practical matters”. <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                    >ChiCom</gloss>s obviously very anxious get to “other practical
                                matters” and while they will want much we not able give believe we
                                should be able play hand so as to continue pressure for release. I
                                now have commitment for “review” all cases including Downey and
                                Fecteau and can take maximum advantage all opportunities exploit
                                this. Of course <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s could
                                continue hold remaining prisoners for further bargaining but they
                                may well estimate prisoners are diminishing asset and I do not
                                exclude possibility of fairly prompt release remainder. Of course,
                                before agreeing proceed second agenda item we would reserve right
                                revert agenda item one as long as any Americans detained.</item>
                            <item>Third, they have come so far on substance our representation
                                proposal that it is difficult maintain further discussion this
                                except in context straight trade for release Americans. In fact this
                                point virtually reached at today’s meeting. In this connection
                                believe it helpful recall that original concept before these talks
                                was that agreeing to representation proposal would assist in
                                obtaining release Americans. I undertook tactic use as bait obtain
                                release some Americans and avoid anticipated <gloss
                                    target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> tactic of asserting agenda
                                item one completed with agreement on representation. Believe it
                                would be mistake now to extend this tactic to point of making
                                release all Americans price of representation agreement.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>If Dept agrees with foregoing position it will be very important that at
                            Tuesday’s meeting I have the maximum discretion Dept is willing to give

                        <p>I would plan at Tuesday’s meeting to present <persName corresp="#p_WP1"

                            satisfied with anything other than release of all. Do not believe I
                            should go any further toward bald position of bargaining representation

                            China to which he made no definite reply. However he reserved right
                            further comment.</p>
                        <p>I again argued against broadening scope para 2 (a) as unnecessary and

                            Our para one dealt with practical situation and we asked them say no
                            more than we said ourselves. Said I recognized their desire handle

                            designed enable them to do so, was not something imposed but simply

                                    from Geneva, August 16, reads at this point as follows:</p>
                                <p>“I pointed out second sentence his paragraph took away from

                            these talks started. Said I held no brief for exact wording our para

                            Willing consider any wording he might suggest with same substance. At

                        <p>At close this phase he said wished “raise another point” and brought up
                            “propaganda campaign” which had been “launched in order slander Chinese
                            people” etc. Since beginning talks <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                            “has repeatedly made clear its conciliatory attitude”. Questions
                            “mistreatment” raised. <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> could

                            feeling he had received specific instructions make statement and that he
                            was somewhat reluctant do so. I deliberately showed anger and curtly
                            replied I did not understand his motive in raising [this point?].

                                    this policy because reports of their treatment of the fliers had
                                    created a wave of indignation. The message continues:</p>

                                    of resentment as they tell their stories. This is a phase which

                                    alter our policy toward visitors to the China mainland because
                                    principal reason for deterring those visitors will have ceased,
                                    namely that we do not want more Americans to get in until it has
                                    been demonstrated that those now there can get out. Subject to

                                    previous I have tried hard to leave them a “legal” way out and

                                    tactical mistake that has largely backfired on them rather than
                                    producing hoped-for results. This has not increased standing

                                <item>Possible additional factor is suspicion from our tactics we

                            I feel we should if possible avoid unilateral public statement along

                            to me this would constitute a public challenge and return problem to

                            Our talks with Chinese at Geneva are not going well. First agreed item
                            was matter of repatriation of civilians.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> in his foreign policy
                            speech of July 30 said, “It should be possible in forthcoming talks at
                            Ambassadorial level to reach first of all reasonable settlement of
                            question of return of civilians to respective countries. Number of
                            American civilians in China is small and question can be easily
                            settled.”</p>
                        <p>Despite this statement <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s
                            representative has so far refused admit right of Americans to return
                            except subject to settlement of civil and criminal cases involving them.
                            This, of course, we knew before going to Geneva. We on our side have
                            agreed that every Chinese national in US who wants to return to
                            Communist China is free to do so and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss>s may designate Indian Embassy to facilitate such
                            return, to transmit funds, etc. We have also agreed right of return and
                            function of Indian Embassy should be widely advertised both by us and by
                            Indian Embassy.</p>
                        <p>The eighth meeting of the Ambassadors will take place tomorrow August 18
                            and unless some progress can soon be made, talks may break down
                            entirely. We are not prepared to go on to discuss other matters unless
                            the agreed first item has been disposed of.</p>
                        <p>It is not our desire to request any intervention on behalf of Soviet
                            Government, but if appropriate occasion arises you might let them know
                            what state of affairs is. They might do something on their own

                        <p>His theme was this was “key which would open door” to solution problem
                            Americans in China and again offered promptly give me names whose cases
                            “review completed” making clear this grant release.</p>
                        <p>My theme was contrast action we had taken Chinese US. He was asking I
                            open door without showing me what was behind it, that if he would show
                            me what was behind it and if it met my request on release all Americans
                            question timing could be worked out.</p>

                            even indication that his solution would bring about release all
                            Americans. Result was complete deadlock but no effort by him to

                            morning’s meeting many references by <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName> to “pressure”, “demands”, “would never respond
                            pressure” etc all of which I of course attempted counter. When on this
                            theme he showed more feeling than on any other point.</p>
                        <p>2. However irrational, their position seems to be that if they release
                            all Americans before or simultaneous with representation agreement it
                            would publicly be interpreted as “yielding to pressure”. They are
                            willing announce release some Americans as purely unilateral act prior
                            to public announcement representation arrangement but must first have
                            firm commitment. They will then subsequently announce further release
                            Americans but will not commit themselves to all as this would be
                            “interference with their sovereignty, legal processes” etc. etc.</p>
                        <p>3. I went as far as I felt I could under my present instructions to meet
                            whatever substance this may have in their minds by stating that if their
                            solution encompassed release all Americans and it was only question
                            timing in relation announcement representation arrangement this could be
                            worked out. However, <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> showed
                            no interest: He also showed no interest in my amendment para one by
                            insertion phrase “as result official action taken in accordance with its
                            governmental processes”.</p>
                        <p>4. His replies to my references <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName>’s statement were weak and beside the point. He
                            avoided direct reply to my reminder that he had <pb n="47"
                                xml:id="pg_47" facs="0075"/>promised me last year “review” cases and
                            that in interim only five civilians out of thirty had been released from
                            prison.</p>
                        <p>5. Deadlock is now very tight and little scope for further discussion
                            until there is some shift in position one side or other.</p>
                        <p>6. Subject to Dept’s suggestions or instructions believe I can do little
                            at next meeting but reiterate our positions as necessary and pick up
                            remaining questions on representation arrangement which is subject

                        <p>143. Foreign Minister called me to his office late yesterday to discuss
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> reserve program and to “warn” me
                            situation likely result in “considerable unpleasantness”. This is strong
                            language and appears properly to indicate intensity of Chinese feeling.
                            He was referring to nine reserve division plan concurred in by <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> last March and further agreed to at

                            without delay”. Chinese apparently interpreted “develop” to mean
                            implement, for decisions made and actions taken, reversal of which would
                            be most difficult and most embarrassing. Foreign Minister admitted he

                        <p>I pointed out “agreement” of March and April was ad referendum and

                                <persName>Yu</persName> have actually named division commanders and
                            staff for proposed nine divisions, and crux of problem is this fact.
                            Cannot now cancel designations and not know what else do with these
                            senior officers.</p>
                        <p>As I understand it, nine division reserve evolved as means of effecting
                            activation [<hi rend="italic">deactivation</hi>] non-supported units and
                            recaptured diverted <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> equipment,
                            providing places more personnel of former. As I also understand it,
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> opposition to nine division plan based
                            on following logic: If US agrees nine division reserve Chinese will
                            continue demand three division combat equipment and eventually hardware
                            for nine divisions; therefore let us not call them divisions. If true,
                            difficulty is one of semantics, but quite upsetting to Chinese, who
                            unwilling call them “groups” or something else. Fear that unless we can
                            find some way out of this dilemma, Chinese will refuse fulfill their
                            part bargain, requiring activation non-supported units and transfer
                                <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment from them to
                            supported forces [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].</p>
                        <p>If difference is simply over what reserve units shall be called, feel we
                            have made our point quite clear, and that Chinese now fully understand
                            we will not provide equipment nine divisions or three divisions or even
                            one full combat division. Foreign Minister himself said that in
                            returning from San Francisco Conference recently, he stopped off in
                            Honolulu under Gimo’s instructions and there gathered from <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> that nine division reserve
                            would be approved, with US to furnish training (as distinct from combat)
                            “equipment” for one division.</p>
                        <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0077"/>
                        <p>Seems to me there are two possible ways out of present situation. One is:
                            Having made our point—regarding tailored equipment for one division
                            reserve training unit clear, we could concede to Chinese dismay and say
                            in effect “If that is clearly understood we interpose no further
                            objection to your calling the nine reserve groups divisions, although it
                            is obvious they will not be divisions worthy of the name, with only one
                            month’s training per year”. Alternatively, perhaps some other
                            organizational solution could be devised by Chinese or American military
                            authorities. In either event, feel we must grant some validity to magic
                            nature of figure total of thirty divisions (21 plus 9) in Chinese eyes,
                            since this is (a) number US supported on mainland and (b) number we
                            allegedly support in Korea.</p>

                                <p>“The Secretary’s telegram 569 of last night gives you as much
                                    negotiating leeway as is possible under present circumstances
                                    without compromising the essential principle. This telegram
                                    gives the Chinese Communists an easy way out if they are willing
                                    to take it, for it means in effect that we would accept their
                                    promise as to Americans who would not be released immediately
                                    and the understanding on the remaining Americans would not have
                                    to be publicized at present. This is going a pretty long way. If
                                    we went any further to meet their demands, we would not even
                                    have a Communist promise in exchange for U.S. performance. We
                                    would indeed be ‘buying a pig in a poke’.” (<hi rend="italic"

                                    >Documents 27</ref> and <ref target="#d28">28</ref>.</note> We
                            do not yet have full text proposal referred to your 520. Superficially
                            paragraph 1 seems to represent some advance. Indeed if word
                            “immediately” were inserted before “further adopt” and if word
                            “promptly” were inserted before “exercise” we would believe it might be
                            acceptable. We would however want it clearly understood that “promptly”
                            meant that a beginning would be made at once and completion effected
                            within some such period as two or three months and that unless this in
                            fact developed we would not consider they were acting in good faith and
                            that further talks might then be broken off. However this understanding
                            need not be made public unless it were breached.</p>
                        <p>As talks have developed it seems to us that Chinese Communists are
                            frustrating agreed first purpose of resumed ambassadorial level talks.
                            That agreed first purpose was “to aid in settling the matter of
                            repatriation of civilians who desire to return to their respective
                            countries”. Also we again recall <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName>’s statement that purpose forthcoming talks at
                            ambassadorial level was “first of all” to reach a reasonable settlement
                            of this matter.</p>
                        <p>As we read your cables, <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s
                            proposal would leave situation in precisely same unsettled state it was
                            when new negotiations were agreed to. It seems to us that until
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> is prepared agree that
                            Americans in China who want to return can promptly do so, we have no
                            alternative but to stand pat constantly repeating that the agreed first
                            purpose of talks is to “settle” these cases and what settlement does he
                            propose.</p>

                                    Amory</persName> to the Director of Central Intelligence. The
                                report’s introduction notes that it is based solely on daily reports
                                from the Formosa Liaison Center. Amory’s memorandum states that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> had
                                categorically asserted that the recent raids were not coordinated
                                with any echelon of his command. Major General <persName>John C.
                                    Macdonald</persName>, former Deputy Chief, <gloss
                                    target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Formosa, had also stated
                                emphatically that the raids were unilateral efforts by the Chinese
                                Nationalists but had cautioned that Nationalist reports of the raids
                                might be exaggerated. Referring to the President’s authorization on
                                January 13 of the continuation of “small-scale” raids by the
                                Nationalists for intelligence purposes, Amory stated that he had
                                considered that this meant at most a squad of 8 or 9 men and by no
                                means as many as 50 men, as was the case with a recent Nationalist
                                raid. He questioned “whether present efforts to secure a de facto
                                cease fire are not apt to be disturbed by Mainland raids of any size
                                to an extent that outweighs their marginal intelligence value”. (<hi

                            settle matter return civilians, I had told him exactly what we had done
                            with respect Chinese and were prepared to do representation, was still
                            waiting know settlement his government proposed make Americans. When
                            this information available could readily agree exact language public
                            announcement but futile further discussion form words until both clear
                            as to substance of what we are announcing. He replied reiterating
                            previous positions but during course give and take I asked him series
                            questions to which his replies made clear all cases being “reviewed”,
                            “completion review” means persons can promptly depart for US, review all
                            cases not “completed”, “he could not forecast time required complete
                            remaining cases” which was dependent on “nature case, conduct
                            individual, improvement relations between two countries”. Talks were one
                            indication improvement and agreement on putting third party
                            representation into operation would be additional improvement. All this
                            would “make settlement of cases easier than in the past”.</p>
                        <p>Had made their “best effort”. All argument that he would reciprocate
                            frankness with which I had made detailed explanation action taken
                            respect Chinese in US was evaded or brushed aside. My efforts this
                            regard were “infringement of sovereignty and interference their
                            juridical processes which they could never accept”.</p>
                        <p>I deliberately avoided any discussions details representation arrangement
                            in order keep discussion focused on central issue. For same reason I
                            also avoided answering familiar allegations treatment Chinese in US and
                            their treatment Americans China.<note n="2" xml:id="d32fn2"><p><persName

                        <p>435. For the Secretary. I had occasion in conversation with
                                <persName>Malenkov</persName> at Yugoslav reception yesterday to
                            make point set forth in your telegram 174.<note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2"
                                    ><ref target="#d26">Document 26</ref>.</note>
                            <persName>Malenkov</persName> was speaking in general “spirit of Geneva”
                            and mentioned that Soviets were very glad to see that contact on
                            Ambassadorial level had been established with <gloss target="#t_CPR1"
                                >CPR</gloss>. I told him that this was all very well but that talks
                            were not going at all well due refusal of Chinese to consider release of
                            imprisoned Americans. I added that there were no obstacles in way of any
                            Chinese in United States who wished to return to China and that United
                            States had even agreed to Chinese proposal that India could act in
                            United States to assist those who wished to return. I told
                                <persName>Malenkov</persName> that they should understand that
                            although to Chinese possibly a relatively limited number of Americans
                            might not seem a major point, to the people and government of the United
                            States questions of this kind dealing with individual human beings were
                            of major importance. I did not pursue the matter beyond this point in
                            the light of your telegram under reference.</p>
                        <p><persName>Malenkov</persName> made some general reference to the
                            “sensibilities” of Communist China which felt that its “rights” as a
                            great power had been ignored but added that he personally could
                            comprehend the importance the United States attached to this question of
                            Americans detained in China. In reply to my statement that the Far East
                            in my personal opinion contained elements of greater danger than other
                            parts of world he expressed agreement. I told him that in my view one of
                            these reasons was that the Chinese were in a different stage of their
                            revolution than the Soviet Union which might incline them to more risky
                            action. <persName>Malenkov</persName> smiled and said this might be a
                            factor in the situation. I have no way of knowing whether this
                            information will be in any way acted on by the Soviet government but I
                                <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0082"/>am reasonably convinced that
                                <persName>Malenkov</persName> appreciated the importance that we
                            attach to the Americans imprisoned in China.</p>

                                exactly parallel, stated that the Department felt the announcement
                                should state the U.S. position accurately, and commented that the
                                deviation from parallel language seemed unavoidable unless the
                                    <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> would match the U.S.
                                statement. It stated that the Department desired no “private

                                    En-lai</persName> in his July 30 speech said ‘it should be
                                possible in the forthcoming talks at the Ambassadorial level to
                                reach, first of all, a reasonable settlement of the question of the
                                return of civilians to their respective countries. The number of
                                American civilians in China is small and the question can easily be
                                settled.’ However, the Chinese Ambassador now insists that these
                                Americans are involved in civil or criminal cases and that the best
                                he can do is to say that these cases will be reviewed and the
                                results subsequently announced. This is not to us an acceptable
                                settlement of the agreed first item. However, I do not want to call
                                upon you for the help you so kindly offer lest the Chinese should
                                feel that we are attempting to exert pressure upon them. I feel
                                therefore it may be better to let matters continue, even at some
                                risk of the negotiations breaking, rather than for me to be in the
                                position of seeming to go behind the back of the negotiators at
                                Geneva.</p>

                            took initiative, restating his position and trying to impress on me
                            number Americans that would immediately be released “was very
                            considerable” and number remaining “would not be large”. He was

                            right” and that release remainder would not take long without saying
                            anything I could seize upon as commitment. (His instructions are clearly
                            very rigid on this.) In response my pressing him throughout evening on

                                    reconstructed it [the “‘involved and tortuous explanation’”]
                                    immediately upon our return as follows: ‘There is no comparison
                                    to be made of the advantages which those who are left will have
                                    over those who have been released during the past one year. For
                                    there are three favoring factors which will make it clearly
                                    quickly and easily for them to be released. The three factors
                                    are (a) favorable effect release of the others will have on the
                                    people still there; (b) circumstances of the case itself; and
                                    (c) state of our relations.’</p>

                                    just unable to obtain any further explanation. His conversation
                                    otherwise was very rational and sensible and the only
                                    explanation I have is that he had been rigidly instructed to say
                                    absolutely nothing more on this subject. The phrasing, to my
                                    mind, very much carries the marks of <persName corresp="#p_CE1"

                            flatly refused. “Absolutely would not be forced into and could not state

                        <p>3. While touching in varying degree on most of arguments I have used in
                            previous meetings I hammered hard on theme that they were entirely
                            misreading American public opinion if they expected slow piecemeal
                            releases to “improve relations”. Any release involves telling of stories
                            by former prisoners and produced very adverse public opinion reactions.
                            This had to be expected. Best course in their self-interest was carry
                            out immediate release of all. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>
                            countered we had previously made flyers major factor, they would not
                            release even response <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> SecGen, but
                            released unilaterally interest good atmosphere and demonstration good
                            faith these talks. “Did not hold them as bargaining counters and did not
                            intend hold any others as bargaining counters.” They knew Col. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HADP1">Arnold</persName> very “antagonistic” but this
                            did not prevent his being included release. Intimation was they very
                            disappointed not only at public reaction to release but that after
                            flyers had been removed as subject these talks we had now raised ante in
                            demanding release all others immediately or in specified time. I
                            countered by returning to theme public reaction to be expected, noted
                            press attention flyers now declining and cited as proof value getting
                            remaining cases completed quickly as possible. Believe this line may
                            have made some impression.</p>
                        <p>4. I carefully outlined successive concessions we had made to obtain
                            agreement and repeatedly stressed “we could go no further”. “We did not
                            even have a definite promise, much less performance we expected,
                            particularly in light <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s
                            statements”. I also made it clear could not proceed anything else until
                            item one settled. (He has never suggested we do so but of course their
                            idea of settlement and ours are still very different.) Also in context
                            importance their meeting our position on item one said it was important
                            agreement be reached as if we failed probably would be long time until
                            contact such as this could be resumed. He put his own emphasis on latter
                            theme.</p>
                        <p>4[<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. He gave me good opportunity to make clear
                            no possibility even considering American visitors until all Americans
                            now detained released by bringing up their desire for visitors including
                            Americans and mentioning proposal for exchange “Chinese Opera” and Porgy
                            and Bess companies. (This regard said they were not “boxers” desiring
                            expel foreigners.)</p>

                            called attention to use of “Government of India”, difference in wording
                            between paragraphs one of two sections made necessary by difference in
                            situation and their failure meet our position, and particularly pointed
                            out that word “promptly” in first paragraph Chinese declaration. Said
                            must be firm definition this word, need not be written into announcement
                            but could be in form oral understanding. Did not want to labor ground we
                            had previously covered but wanted to make it perfectly clear without any
                            possibility misunderstanding US Government cannot accept any arrangement

                            time. Requested he inform his government that US considers this vital.
                            This draft went as far as I thought we could go in meeting his point of
                            view.</p>

                            my draft until next meeting but offhand did not see reason for
                            difference of wording of two paragraphs one. Then repeated in summary
                            form previous statements that “could not possibly accept time limit as
                            this would amount to submitting to coercion.” Also repeated number
                            immediately to be released “not small” and cases remaining could be
                            considered “favorably, quickly and easily because of factors of attitude
                            prisoners, fact of our agreement and improvement in relations”.</p>
                        <p>I made no detailed reply but expressed hope he would send draft to his

                                    on a number of others. How long are we justified in delaying and
                                    possibly even jeopardizing release of these persons in effort to

                                    draft in telegram 617 from Geneva, August 25. It was headed
                                    “Agreed Announcement of the Ambassadors of the <gloss
                                        target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and the USA”. The introductory
                                    sentence stated that the two Ambassadors had “agreed to announce
                                    the measures which their respective governments have adopted
                                    with respect to the return of nationals of each located in the

                                    as follows:</p>

                            taken all necessary measures but focused attention on substitution “as

                        <p>In fact virtually all of meeting centered around my continued effort

                            and after he had in reply clearly related release of flyers to decision
                            hold these meetings, release Americans whose cases review completed to
                            our agreement to “agreed announcement” and again gave “state of
                            relations” as one factor in timing release remainder, I very bluntly
                            stated I had not and would not trade the fate of Americans detained by
                            them for political concessions or agreements they desired obtain. Said
                            it seemed clear to me what he was saying was that release remaining
                            Americans would be dependent upon whether in future I willing to agree
                            further agreements desired by them. This I would not do. I was prepared
                            deal with each problem that we discussed on its own merits, we had taken
                            action respect Chinese US without condition and without attempting
                            extract political concessions from them in return.</p>
                        <p>I had first hoped and expected they would promptly release all Americans
                            thus paralleling action taken by US with respect Chinese, we could
                            thereupon quickly agree on announcement of what each country had done
                            and announce agreement on representation. I had then attempted obtain
                            his agreement that release Americans would be simultaneous with
                            announcement and had now gone to position that only some Americans would
                            be released at time of announcement (even though I had previously made
                            clear was no justification withholding their release for this reason)
                            and only asked that he give me definite time limit in which remainder
                            would be released. “I do not see how it is possible for me to go any
                            further.”</p>
                        <p>I also argued at some length that agreement on words in announcement
                            without clear and common understanding exact meaning would not
                            contribute to “improvement of relations” in future but could only lead
                            to misunderstanding. If “as soon as possible”, “promptly” or whatever
                            word was agreed upon meant to them a period of for example a year “that
                            was one thing” but if it meant <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0093"
                            />period of “two or in any event not more than three months that was
                            something else”. Said whatever word or phrase this respect was used
                            American people would expect very prompt action on release remainder and
                            if this did not eventuate “state of relations” could not but
                            deteriorate. From our discussion thus far very clear <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> concept of “as soon as possible”,
                            “quickly”, “promptly” very different from ours. Could not reach any
                            agreement on words until we were clear what we were talking about.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> did not contest my statement
                            release remainder would be conditional on political factors. Now quite
                            clear “political hostage” aspect does not shock them. On contrary they
                            are clearly proceeding on premise that release of Americans is political
                            act of grace and therefore directly related to other political factors
                            in relations between two countries. This position more frankly and
                            clearly stated today than ever before. It was almost complete retreat
                            from “legalities and juridical procedures”.</p>

                            release further Americans. If talks continued go well and “relations
                            continued improve” all remaining Americans could be released. They
                            reconcile this with <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s
                            statement on grounds expectation “progress” would be made these talks.
                            They do not attach much real importance what we have done re Chinese in
                            US, nor have they ever attempted directly link future rate departure
                            Chinese in US with departure Americans. Their raising issue Chinese in
                            US is largely to construct “straw man” and give basis for exploiting
                            opening wedge Indian representation might constitute for them.</p>
                        <p>While not prominent in today’s meeting their sensitivity to anything they
                            interpret as “responding to pressure” and their desire maintain
                            appearance of “legality” are also still factors. However question
                            “understanding” on jurisdiction and scope representation arrangement was
                            not raised today by <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> and, of
                            course, I did not mention subject. He may still do so but believe he may
                            now have dropped this although his rewording of paras 2 (a) both
                            sections may be intended broaden arrangement so that <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s could request India “investigate
                            facts” any case.</p>
                        <p>See little I can do next meeting except reiterate our position and
                            discuss remaining points disagreement in “draft agreed announcement”.
                            However I have little hope of making any progress on major substantive
                            issue.</p>

                            indicates following substantial changes: 1) In first paragraph
                            “repatriation <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0095"/>of civilians”
                            changed to “return of nationals.” 2) Unilateral announcements are
                            couched in terms of an agreement. 3) India is “entrusted” to assist
                            return, and in paying expenses Indian Government is to act “on behalf of
                            the Government of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>,” thus
                            connoting idea of a protecting power instead of third party designated
                            by US primarily to confirm that its statement regarding freedom to
                            return is in fact true. 4) Indian Government is authorized to “make
                            investigation of the facts,” the words “in any such ease” being dropped.
                            Effect of this would be permit Indian Government investigate entire
                            matter, presumably all Chinese in US, and not merely those requesting
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>These changes appear to indicate 1) intent to convert announcements into
                            an agreement, 2) to have it apply to all Chinese in US and to describe
                            them as nationals of <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, 3) to give
                            India right to investigate generally and not simply those Chinese who
                            appeal to it, and 4) to establish India as a protecting power.<note

                        <p>Taipei has informed the Department that during the period from March 3
                            (when the Mutual Defense Treaty came into effect) to August 15, 1955,
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Air Force flew 2,476 sorties
                            which included day and night reconnaissance, combat patrols, leaflet
                            drops and anti-ship strikes. A compilation made in the Department on the
                            basis of daily reports yielded a total of 2,189 reconnaissance and
                            patrol missions (at least 50% of which probably involved flights over
                            the mainland or adjacent waters), 396 definitely confirmed overflights,
                            18 leaflet drops which are also confirmed overflights and 151 anti-ship
                            strikes. The Department’s compilation was for the period March 3 to
                            August 6 and added up to a total of 2,754 sorties. These figures are
                            sufficiently close together to justify taking either compilation as
                            being reasonably accurate.</p>
                        <p>During the same period, the Chinese Communists violated <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> air space on one occasion, on June 27,
                            when two MIG–15’s flew over Matsu and attacked an unarmed Fuhsing
                            airliner. Neither Taipei nor the Department has information which would

                            patrols. The Communists fired 1,069 rounds at the Quemoy complex and 11
                            Communist patrols were observed or captured.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> naval patrols were maintained on a

                            in the area of the Min River near Foochow, around the entrances to Amoy,
                            and less intensively all along the coast, sometimes going as far north
                            as the Taishan Islands (about 27 degrees North) and as far south as
                            Swatow. It is doubtful that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> vessels
                            operated very often within the three-mile limit, but did fire on coastal
                            targets 7 times and received shore battery fire six times. The <gloss

                            probably made for propaganda purposes and appears to be grossly
                            inaccurate. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>-controlled English
                            language newspapers described the “13,000” sorties as “combat and patrol

                            the English language newspapers carried a loose translation of General

                                >Wang</persName>’s exaggerated remarks were innocent and primarily
                            intended to bolster the morale of the people on Taiwan, the Department
                            believes the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> may be motivated to
                            issue such statements by the hope that they might cause difficulties in

                                    commenting. As General <persName>Sun</persName> widely
                                    identified with American viewpoint on military matters, for US

                                    would be considered by many as disloyalty on our part. When
                                    questioned by Chinese friends, our reaction will be that in

                                    substantially to the success of our military aid programs and
                                    has cooperated whole-heartedly with US in all fields, hence we
                                    were surprised at the charges, which seem almost incredible; but

                                    August 31, was identical in substance to the agreed announcement

                                    section reads as follows:</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> was relaxed, made no serious
                            effort press to any showdown, and showed no great sense of urgency. He
                            quickly reached decisions at table on language draft and while
                            immediately noting I had gone back on language our August 16 draft
                            particularly on introductory para did not press his advantage this
                            regard. Degree to which he conceded disputed points in draft also
                            indicated they may not have been attaching same value thereto as we had
                            assumed. While I succeeded in avoiding expressly committing myself to
                            draft in face his willingness reach immediate agreement on text I will
                            have to have very cogent reasons for introducing any further

                                further commented: <p>“I also have a feeling that we are becoming
                                    increasingly reluctant to recognize the implications of having

                                    everything possible to avoid all the apparent pitfalls but
                                    believe it hard to maintain the fiction that two Ambassadors can

                        <p>In considering our future course of action believe must recognize that we

                            Thus their desire to get to item two is probably principal lever which
                            would move them towards accepting our position. Effectiveness lever
                            difficult estimate and <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> may be
                            doing good job dissimulation. However I have feeling their desire get to
                            item two still far from strong enough to overcome their very strong
                            reluctance give up their position to degree that would be required to
                            give advance commitment on time limit for release remaining Americans.

                            Americans.</p>
                        <p>While at moment risk may not seem great I continue be concerned that
                            there could at any time be development which would further delay release

                                <p>“One aspect that worries me is that the longer we continue in the
                                    present deadlocked position, the more hardened positions on both
                                    sides tend to become and the more difficult it becomes to shift
                                    therefrom. Looking at it solely from the standpoint of the
                                    overall welfare of the detained Americans, I find it hard to
                                    work out the equation but believe it important that we do so. We
                                    are today able to obtain the release of X number of Americans
                                    and within the next month or two Y number may well have been
                                    added to that. How large the remaining Z will be I have no way
                                    of telling, but it will certainly include the three or four
                                    ‘difficult’ cases. I am convinced that these latter cases are,
                                    under the best of circumstances, going to take a long time and
                                    doubt whether what we now have to offer under agenda item one is
                                    going to obtain their release. Of course I know that the answer
                                    is that under the present outlook neither under agenda item two
                                    are we going to be able to offer anything that would obtain
                                    their release. This may well be the case. However, should X and
                                    Y be indefinitely detained in what may be a futile effort to
                                    obtain Z?”</p></note></p>

                                    as though they would agree to release all of the American
                                    civilians ‘expeditiously’ and without any of the trick language
                                    they have been seeking which might carry implications of their
                                    legitimacy. Despite much discouragement, we have remained firm
                                    and patient, and it may pay off. Then, the next phase will
                                    develop. That, too, will be difficult. But as long as we are
                                    talking there is less risk to Quemoy and Matsu, and Formosa.”

                            should argue on Tuesday for time agreement but if not forthcoming you
                            should indicate your agreement ad referendum that in next meeting

                            Americans. Make clear however that word “expeditiously” means just that
                            and we expect announcement to be carried out in that sense. Would like
                            your views on timing of publication of announcement. We believe
                            announcement should be simultaneous Geneva, Peiping and Washington or

                                    When we talk about ‘discussion about Item Two’ and ‘what should
                                    constitute Item Two’ we mean the topics that might be
                                    appropriate for acceptance under Item Two. Even this discussion
                                    of what would be appropriate topics should be recessed if the
                                    Agreed Announcement is not carried out in good faith. WSR’s last
                                    injunction to me in Richmond yesterday afternoon was to stress
                                    the importance of not getting into actual substance of Item Two
                                    until all the Americans are out and that includes of course the
                                    hard-core cases. We would probably never get the most difficult
                                    cases out if we move into Item Two while they are still

                        <p>Only voiced objection to “in any such case” was that it was clear without

                            said did not object in principle to phrase and I pressed my advantage to
                            maximum. His argumentation was weak and he several times appeared to
                            waver toward accepting phrase but appeared he had received instructions
                            since our last meeting and he was not clear whether he was able
                            concede.</p>
                        <p>Opposition to “now” in <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> section was
                            very much stronger, implication of word not in accordance facts as far
                            as <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> concerned, could never accept
                            this word etc. I pointed out always included our drafts, while not in
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> drafts, they had not at last
                            meeting or previously specifically raised issue, did not do violence to
                            even their interpretation facts etc. Clearly his instructions on this
                            very categorical and although I used to maximum my very strong
                            negotiating position was entirely unable shake him.<note n="4"

                            matters and brief comments concerning the previous day’s meeting.]</p>
                        <p>I presume that you are reconciled, and prepared for <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> screaming loud and hard when I
                            refuse to go on immediately to item two following the announcement. I
                            hope we will be successful in our tactic but believe we must recognize
                            that the July 25th announcement does not in any way imply that we would
                            not talk about other practical matters until all the Americans were
                            released. In fact, if they had not released the flyers, I would have had
                            from the very beginning to have talked about that “other practical
                            matter”. Of course the agenda proposal which they made greatly helps and
                            strengthens our ability to maintain this tactic, but I see some rough
                            seas ahead.</p>
                        <p>While it may be true that if we do not get all the Americans out before
                            we undertake discussion of item two, we will not be able to do so; at
                            the same time I am not sure it is going to be at all easy to get the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> to fall in with this. I most
                            certainly do not expect any mass release in any ten days or two weeks
                            and think it would be wrong to base our plans on this even being a
                            possibility. In spite of the satisfactory nature of the “agreed
                            announcement” and our ability to use it to put public pressure on them,
                            we must recognize that “improvement of relations” is still being
                            maintained by them as a factor in the release of all Americans. If we
                            too obviously stall on coming to grips with item two, they may well get
                            their backs up on the release of further Americans, and we will again
                            face another impasse. We can, of course, publicly beat them over the
                            head with the “agreed announcement” and will do so, but the entire
                            operation is not going to be easy or simple.</p>
                        <p>I will greatly appreciate all the thoughts and suggestions that you can
                            give me on how you visualize my handling of “what should constitute item
                            two of the agenda”. That is, do you visualize a program which would have
                            for its ostensible purpose the establishing of an agreement upon the
                            sub-points to be discussed under agenda item two? If so, how do you
                            visualize my formulation of our points, particularly the “no force”
                            point?</p>
                        <p>As soon as you have a chance to do so, I would greatly appreciate an
                            outline of the whole trend of our thinking on our tactics under agenda
                            item two. There are, of course, many difficulties in attempting just to
                            keep talking without asking for or giving concessions. <pb n="79"
                                xml:id="pg_79" facs="0107"/>We have a great paucity of subjects
                            which can be raised without involving the interests of the <gloss

                            and I will be continually on the defensive. It seems to me that it will
                            also be difficult in such circumstances for me to avoid being too
                            obviously in the position of simply stalling. I wish I could think of
                            some positive and offensive approach we could make, but thus far have
                            not been able to do so.<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2"><persName

                                to ask if <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> would be

                                inevitable publicity. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>
                                then sent tickets for the following night with the promise that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>’s presence would
                                not be publicized, and <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                    >Johnson</persName> reciprocated by sending him tickets for a
                                concert in Geneva by the New York Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra.
                                He commented that he was doing this “with the thought this sort of

                                ahead” and felt that “by maintaining a reasonably easy personal
                                relationship to which he has been responsive, I can do much to avoid
                                or postpone a break when the going gets tough.” (<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>On the whole question of renunciation of force, I believe it important
                            that we have a carefully thought out program. We have clearly renounced
                            force in Article I of our Treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss>, as well as under our United Nations obligations, but
                            it does not seem to me at all clear that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> has done so since it considers action against the
                            mainland as an internal matter. It seems to me that the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> is playing the present situation very
                            cleverly by talking softly, apparently engaging in no overt offensive
                            operations, while the Nationalists still continue their small-scale
                            raids, their reconnaissance flights and their belligerent statements.
                            How do I answer <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> allegations that our
                            Treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and the accompanying
                            exchange of notes, together with our supply and equipment to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, simply proves that we are approving
                            and supporting the military activities of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> against the mainland? Also what do I say when the
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> quotes <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> official statements in questioning whether the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has in fact accepted the principle of
                            nonrecourse to force with respect to the mainland? Perhaps there are
                            easy answers to these questions, but I must confess that I do not know
                            what they are.</p>
                        <p>When this entire question comes up, I believe we should anticipate the
                            possibility of <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> proposing to us a
                            joint declaration perhaps something along the lines of <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s “five principles”<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d50fn3">The “five principles of peaceful coexistence”, as
                                set forth in a Sino-Indian communiqué of June 28, 1954, were mutual
                                respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,
                                nonaggression, noninterference in each other’s internal affairs,
                                equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. For text of

                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> which would not in the slightest
                            affect their “right” to use force to “liberate” Taiwan as long as they
                            treat it as an internal matter. If, as I assume, we reject any joint
                            declaration, what are we proposing in its stead? Do we want a general
                            unilateral declaration on renunciation of force so worded as also to
                            specifically apply to the Formosa situation, and, if so, are we not
                            asking for something which the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would
                            refuse to do? Or rather than a renunciation of force, are we looking for
                            a de facto cease fire between the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>? If so, this seems to be outside
                            the scope of these talks as clearly something that directly involves the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>All the foregoing I realize is very confused as it simply reflects my
                            very confused thinking which I am sharing out loud with you and know
                            that you will treat it as such. I will appreciate all the thoughts you

                            to have this thought through clearly in my own mind before I come up
                            against it. I am sorry that there was not sufficient time while I was in
                            Washington really to talk these things through. I hope that you will
                            have an opportunity thoroughly to do so with the Secretary and <persName

                                <p>“The Secretary read the latter half of your letter No. 7, when we
                                    briefed him and received new guidance from him at his home on
                                    September 18 right after his return from Duck Island. So the
                                    Secretary is aware of the general nature of your forebodings
                                    about the ‘no force’ issue. In general we attach more weight
                                    than you apparently have so far to the commitment we have from
                                    the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the Exchange of Notes
                                    of Dec. 10 pursuant to the Mutual Defense Treaty. Admittedly
                                    this commitment has not prevented and will not prevent minor
                                    sea, air and artillery incidents. But these are mere pin pricks
                                    which are going to have to be considered as something which must
                                    be lived with in the present situation. We must look to the
                                    central issue which is major invocation of force for a general
                                    offensive purpose. On this we have a commitment from the
                                    Nationalists which ties in with our own renunciation. We believe
                                    this should give you a somewhat stronger position than you have
                                    recognized. But admittedly you would have to develop a tactic
                                    for brushing aside the small incidents as trivial and
                                    inevitable, as not essentially bearing on the central issue.”

                        <p>The Acting Secretary told the Ambassador that we were deeply concerned
                            over the prospect of Belgian recognition of Communist China and that in
                            the absence of the U.S. Ambassador in Brussels we had wired our Chargé
                            d’Affaires to express this concern to the Belgian government. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> then read to the
                            Ambassador the substance of the telegram (Department’s 276 of September
                            3, 1955).<note n="2" xml:id="d51fn2">The telegram under reference was
                                prompted by telegram 223 from Brussels, September 1, which reported
                                that Foreign Minister <persName>Spaak</persName> called in Chargé
                                Philip D. Sprouse that morning to tell him that after careful
                                consideration and discussion with the Prime Minister and his
                                colleagues, he had concluded that the “time had come” for
                                recognition. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 793.02/9–255 and
                                793.02/9–155, respectively)</note> He went on to say that he wished
                            to express as earnestly as he could the U.S. concern over this
                            situation. He particularly emphasized that, over the last year, the
                            people of the U.S. have come to have increasingly strong feelings
                            regarding Communist China. The U.S. Congress has gone on record
                            virtually unanimously against this admission to the <gloss

                                text, see Section 12 of the Mutual Security Act of 1955 (approved
                                July 8; 69 Stat. 283).</note> He is very concerned that, were
                            Belgium to recognize the Peiping regime, there would be a strong public
                            reaction in this country which might jeopardize the traditionally
                            cordial relations between our two nations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> remarked that such
                            an action could not come at a worse time. He referred more particularly
                            to negotiations which are proceeding at the present time for the release
                            of American civilians who are still being held by the Chinese
                            Communists. If the latter should now receive further recognition, these
                            negotiations would be imperiled. There is no evidence that Communist
                            China has given up her long-term objectives or would change her tactics
                            except through force and pressure of public opinion. The Chinese
                            Communists continue to violate their international agreements. They now
                            have at <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0110"/>least seven hundred
                            thousand troops in North Korea and the buildup continues. An analogous
                            situation is found in Indochina.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> remarked that we do
                            not, of course, expect an answer from Baron Silvercruys at this moment
                            regarding his Government’s final position. The Ambassador replied that
                            this conversation would be faithfully reported. Naturally, any reply on
                            this matter must come from the Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister and he
                            could not presume to speak for Mr. <persName>Spaak</persName>. Speaking
                            personally, however, he would like to note the following points.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>What he thinks is in Mr. <persName>Spaak</persName>’s mind is
                                that, as the years go by, one is impressed by the fact that in
                                Peiping there is a group which firmly controls the Chinese mainland.
                                The probabilities are that this regime will continue to assert
                                effective control over that area.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>To be sure, the administration of the area is a cruel one, and
                                some doubt may be expressed about the allegiance of some of the
                                people, but all indications are that sovereignty is exercised to the
                                fullest extent to which a government is able and that we must admit
                                it.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The people of China, it is true, are not well informed but the
                                fact is that the group in Peiping represents that mass of people and
                                at Geneva has participated in the settlement of matters at the
                                highest level, even of matters outside Communist China.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Communist China is dealing at Geneva on the ambassadorial level
                                with the U.S. not only on matters dealing with prisoners but with
                                other subjects.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Therefore, Communist China today is dealing with many other nations as a
                            full-fledged power. Not only is considerable Belgian capital invested in
                            China but the Communist regime is holding a number of Belgian
                            businessmen as hostages. Belgium must cope with this situation. This
                            must have been a fundamental preoccupation of the Foreign Minister when
                            he broached the matter with the U.S. Chargé d’Affaires in Brussels. Mr.
                                <persName>Spaak</persName> might have broached the matter in quite
                            another way, such as in a public speech, but the Ambassador was glad he
                            took the direct approach when he went to Mr.
                                <persName>Sprouse</persName> because, between friends, you can
                            always adjust differences. Mr. <persName>Spaak</persName> had not rushed
                            into the matter. It might be compared to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ action in giving <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> the benefit of his thoughts before
                            public declarations. Of course, Mr. <persName>Spaak</persName> may not
                            have had all information that is available regarding the aggressive
                            intentions of Peiping, but there is a certain amount of tranquility
                            which now prevails along the Formosa Strait, in Korea and along the
                            borders of China. Today the Chinese regime is not relying on force. Thus
                            it was that Mr. <persName>Spaak</persName> wanted the Department to
                            realize how his trend of thought was running. Mr.
                                <persName>Spaak</persName> will be in New York on the 21st of
                            September and Baron Silvercruys doubts that anything will happen <pb
                                n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0111"/>before that date. He also
                            promised that he would send on to Brussels a careful account of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>’s and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s remarks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> said that he deeply
                            appreciated Mr. <persName>Spaak</persName>’s approaching us and added
                            that the U.S. looks at this matter differently from Belgium, due to our
                            geographic situation. We are contiguous with the Orient and, therefore,
                            in dealing with China, we are dealing with a neighbor. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stated that we feel that the
                            admission of Communist China into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            hangs upon its fulfillment of its international obligations. If there
                            seems to be a tranquil situation today, this is due largely to Communist
                            China’s realization of the attitude which the civilized world takes. We
                            feel that any acceptance of Communist China’s past actions would lead to
                            further aggression on its part.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> also expressed
                            concern over any effort to lift the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            finding of aggression against Communist China. In forming the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> the members agreed to renounce force as a
                            means of seeking their ends. Communist China has not budged an iota on
                            the use of force. After the aggression in Korea and Indochina, what has
                            suddenly happened to qualify it for membership in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>? It isn’t a question of who is in
                            territorial possession as regards the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            seat. The U.S. is united politically against letting Communist China
                            into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Ambassador replied that
                            Mr. <persName>Spaak</persName> is keenly alive to the 1951 resolution
                            labeling Communist China as an aggressor four years ago,<note n="4"

                            of tranquility.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> noted that we had to
                            negotiate with the Chinese Communists at Geneva as they were the ones
                            who committed the aggression. This implied no recognition; if a gangster
                            takes my child, I have to negotiate with the gangster. Recognition by
                            Britain of Communist China did not help the British get their properties
                            in China back again.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> emphasized his concern
                            over U.S. public opinion and his wish to avoid misunderstanding in the
                            public mind. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> again
                            commented that the timing now is especially bad. The Ambassador asked
                            what would be the conditions under which recognition could be
                            contemplated. Would Communist China have to give up all recourse to
                            force? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said we
                            think they wish to control all of the Far East. We think if the Chinese
                            Communists are suddenly accepted, all the Southeast Asian countries
                            would be sucked into the Chinese orbit and this would be a threat to the
                            whole free world. The Peiping regime Communists are Communists first and
                            Chinese second, the most fanatical Communists in the world.</p>

                        <p>It was agreed that since Mr. <persName>Spaak</persName> would arrive in

                                be released at 5 p.m. Geneva time. He reported in telegram 705 of

                                    >Wang</persName> had given him the names of three imprisoned

                            <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> struggled hard to retain

                            suggesting both “now” and “in any such case” be retained US section
                            while both deleted from <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                            section.</p>
                        <p>Also tried hard to insert “the problem of” or “the question of” before

                            would read “with respect to the problem of Chinese in US Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> etc” Finally
                            compromised by leaving agreed English text as is Chinese text to contain
                            phrase this effect. <persName>Ekvall</persName> and <persName

                        <p>At very end meeting said names of additional Americans released in future
                            would be notified to US through <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. I
                            then replied I hoped in accordance with announcement other cases would
                            be expeditiously handled and settled that during course of talks here he
                            would inform me as well as <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> of names
                            those released and said I would be prepared report to him on our
                            implementation statement. He carefully ignored all reference to making

                            US “present official text agreed announcement to <gloss target="#t_UK1"

                            investigations by Chargé would be “in accordance with terms of

                            still imprisoned. He then returned to his proposal formal text
                            announcement be given <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> by US and India
                            by <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> will then give full information to <gloss

                        <p>4) He then asked my assent to his speaking, on which I indicated I had
                            nothing further to say this morning and indicated no objection. He then
                            pulled out and read a long prepared statement to effect <pb n="90"
                                xml:id="pg_90" facs="0118"/>now that “agreement” reached on Item 1
                            should turn to Item 2 under which desired raise two points: US economic
                            blockade and embargo and preparation for “negotiations at a higher level
                            on easing and elimination of tensions in the Taiwan area”. Also asked
                            what I thought should be discussed under Item 2.</p>
                        <p>5) At close his statement I said I had “noted it” and stated that I also
                            had matters which I wished to discuss under Item 2 “at the proper time”
                            but felt it was premature. “I cannot consider Item 1 finally disposed of
                            until all Americans in <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> who desire
                            return are able to do so.” “Agreed announcement represented advance but
                            way in which carried out cannot but help influence atmosphere in which
                            discussion Item 2 carried on.” Hoped we could quickly get to Item 2.</p>
                        <p>6) <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> apparently surprised and
                            not prepared for my position which he characterized as very strange and
                            regrettable. In much inconclusive give and take along these lines, I
                            pointed out Item I could have been quickly and completely resolved if
                            they had permitted all Americans return but 19 Americans still detained,
                            etc In reply specific question as to when I would consider it “proper
                            time” proceed Item 2, I stated “when it is clear the terms agreed
                            announcement being faithfully implemented.”</p>
                        <p>7) At end of meeting when usual question arose as to what to say to
                            press, he said “I will inform press of the two items I have raised and
                            you are free to tell them what you wish”. I misunderstood and
                            interpreted his statement as meaning only that he was going to tell the
                            press we had discussed agenda Items 1 and 2, and replied that I was
                            going to inform press simply that we had exchanged information on
                            implementation agreed announcement. On comparing notes my advisors after
                            meeting I am now clear that what he meant was that he was going to
                            inform press two subjects raised his prepared statement this morning
                            which he has done.<note n="4" xml:id="d56fn4">A memorandum of

                            program. There is another aspect of unit assignment to the offshore

                        <p>745. 1. At today’s meeting two hours ten minutes, apparently on theory
                            best defense is offensive, <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>
                            opened with statement accusing me of violating understanding on private
                            nature talks reaffirming desire to keep talks private.</p>
                        <p>2. I replied with statement explaining my misunderstanding his intention
                            at last meeting, pointing out his statement disclosed substance his
                            remarks therefore required me make public substance our position.
                            Regretted his statement yesterday,<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2"><persName

                                    >Ibid</hi>., 611.93/9–1955)</note> noted I had made no response
                            and hoped “I will not have to do so”. Glad he agreed meetings should
                            continue to be private. This followed by some give and take on whose
                            fault but reaffirmation of agreement on private nature talks.</p>
                        <p>3. I then made reply his letter along lines paragraph 5 my 740<note n="3"

                        <p>4. There was then long give and take with <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName> on one hand trying twist my remarks into statement
                            we had “invited” <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and “agreed” to

                            pointed out clear language agreed announcement, and emphasized substance
                            of situation, that is, US had immediately taken all action implement
                            agreed announcement with respect to third countries, India now able
                            function in US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> apparently still not
                            able function in <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. Said it was
                            imperative they take with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> action

                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> had extended “invitation” to <gloss

                                >Nehru</persName> had announced in Parliament its acceptance.
                            Towards end I pressed hard for statement <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> would contact <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Chargé

                            immediately start functioning. After unsuccessfully pressing me hard to
                            say we had “invited” <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in accordance
                            with announcement he apparently chose to accept my statement that we had
                            informed <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and requested it undertake
                            functions and while avoiding direct reply my insistence that <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> contact <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> Chargé, appeared to indicate they would do necessary

                        <p>5. I then made statement on publicity agreed announcement Chinese press
                            in US and referred to unanswered questions I had asked him in last
                            meeting specifically pointing up health and welfare each American not
                            released and information on agreed announcement to Americans still in
                            jail.</p>
                        <p>6. On health and welfare he countered by renewing demand for names and
                            addresses all Chinese in US but avoided direct reply to my question as
                            to whether he now refusing give me information on health and welfare
                            Americans in jail. With respect informing Americans in jail he said “I
                            told you last meeting what is done and that still holds”.</p>
                        <p>7. After some additional give and take along these lines during which I
                            expressed disappointment he had no information for me today on
                            implementation, I made statement accordance paragragh 7, <gloss

                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> made impromptu reply to
                            effect that understanding at outset of talks was that either side could
                            bring up anything it considered be practical matter at issue, not

                            launched into strong attack on my mention of 19, no Americans detained,
                            only criminals in jail, have admitted crimes of espionage and

                            activities, etc., etc., and then at some length flatly accused US of
                            raising these issues deliberately in order to stall on discussion item
                            two, difficult understand since US had made original July 25 proposal,

                                that “on the contrary, it was the function of these talks to make

                            concentrated entirely on our dissatisfaction with implementation

                            there, this not “expeditious” release, no replies our request for

                            meeting, to which I expressed my strong dissatisfaction his lack of

                            on discussion item two. At close of meeting he stated that if at next

                            unqualified approval of the course we were following. Both stated that
                            in their opinion we should not proceed to a discussion of “practical
                            matters” under item 2 until we were satisfied that our jailed citizens
                            in China had been notified of their rights under the agreement of
                            September 10th and further that the British Chargé in Peiping had been
                            allowed personal communication with them.</p>
                        <p>They both agreed that we should insist that the Communists carry out
                            their agreement for the discussion of “practical matters” at issue at
                            the Ambassadorial level. Both agreed that the renunciation of force was
                            a proper subject for discussion under item 2.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GSWF1">Senator George</persName> emphasized that we

                                    the talks solely on that note. He further commented:</p>

                                    argument. It would, under these circumstances seem to me to be
                                    our best tactic to attempt to focus on a substantive exchange on

                            goals.</p>
                        <p>“It is an essential foundation and preliminary to the success of the
                            discussions under Item 2 that it first be made clear that the parties to
                            these discussions renounce the use of force to make the policies of
                            either prevail over those of the other. That particularly applies to the
                            Taiwan area.</p>
                        <p>“The acceptance of this principle does not involve third parties, or the
                            justice or injustice of conflicting claims. It only involves recognizing
                            and agreeing to abide by accepted standards of international
                            conduct.</p>

                        <p>“We ask, therefore, as a first matter for discussion under Agenda Item 2,
                            assurance that your side will not resort to the use of force in the
                            Taiwan area except defensively. The U.S. would be prepared to give a
                            corresponding assurance. These reciprocal assurances will make it
                            appropriate for us to pass on to the discussion of other matters with a
                            better hope of coming to constructive conclusions.”</p>

                            meeting with long prepared statement to effect agreed announcement
                            completed agenda item one, we were entangling agenda items one and two,

                            Americans released “this sure to fail”, will not submit to threats,

                            consideration and that discussion thereof be referred to assistants.

                            returned who left since beginning of talks, knows of no one who has left

                            fearful to apply for departure, etc. Our attitude will “impair the

                            on our lenient way of solving the problem remaining Americans”.</p>
                        <p>2. I replied with long statement stating no need spend much time on these
                            subjects if he would give me straightforward answers to my
                            straightforward and simple questions on implementation, unless were
                            willing to keep each other fully informed on implementation will be
                            difficult to make progress discussion other matters, implementation too
                            important to leave to assistants, then refuted his statements on Chinese
                            students in US, welcomed statement they willing give consideration
                            suggestions on implementation, pointed out my repeated questions this
                            regard, repeated them and also re-framed as suggestions asking for
                            specific replies, in referring statement on threats said I could not
                            understand how my questions on <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0134"

                            would not respond to threats, <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> should
                            be absolutely clear we not willing trade fate remaining persons for
                            political concessions. Three weeks since agreed announcement and not one
                            of 19 yet released, our concern increases with passage of time no
                            information on this vital point, only prompt full and faithful
                            implementation announcement can dispose agenda item one, only
                            implementation words of announcement can dispose of problem return of
                            Americans, until this accomplished first item of agenda remains first
                            order of business, have returned to it today and will continue to return
                            to it as long as questions remain.</p>
                        <p>3. I then took note of fact 10 imprisoned Americans arrived in Hong Kong
                            and some of 12 had also arrived and in expectation <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> will act expeditiously with remaining
                            19 and further effort demonstrate our desire talks should progress,
                            desired discuss with him today topics which we should discuss under
                            agenda item two. Referred my rejection of higher level meeting and put
                            forward two subjects “renunciation of use of force for achievement
                            national objectives” and “accounting for US personnel”. Consider
                            renunciation of force of fundamental importance to discussion agenda
                            item two, should therefore be discussed before economic embargo.
                            Therefore suggested subjects in order of (a) accounting US

                                as a subject for discussion under agenda item two. A correction was
                                sent on September 28 instructing him to change this to “Accounting
                                for U.S. Military Personnel” but <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"

                        <p>4. In reply <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> reiterated
                            previous points on implementation and then referring my suggestion
                            renunciation of force as topic read short prepared statement which was
                            largely non sequitur in terms of what I had said but repeated usual
                            Communist line “not wanting war with US, <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> had renounced force in international relations, tension
                            in Formosa Straits caused by presence US forces” etc All this could be
                            resolved only by higher level meeting. Expressed puzzlement by what I
                            meant under subject “accounting for US personnel”, said thought this
                            taken care of under agenda item one.</p>
                        <p>5. In reply I returned to implementation repeating my questions and again
                            also reframing as suggestions asking for reply next meeting. Then
                            briefly discussed higher level meeting repeating previous position and
                            adding his proposal indicated pessimism which I did not share on what
                            two of us should be able to accomplish. Pointed out I had presented our
                            two items in as neutral terms as possible and would be prepared
                            subsequently discuss them.</p>
                        <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0135"/>
                        <p>6. He then stated prepared to continue discussion next meeting but wanted
                            to make clear had not committed himself on subjects or their order. I
                            agreed and he accepted my proposal for Wednesday, October 5 for next
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>7. He tried hard obtain press communiqué omitting reference to discussion
                            implementation agreed announcement but we finally agreed upon communiqué
                            identical with that of last meeting. He said would not regard this as
                            precedent for communiqué next meeting.</p>

                        <p>After the initial pleasantries, the Chinese Foreign Minister, Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">George Yeh</persName>, said he had
                            wanted to exchange ideas with the Secretary before the Foreign Ministers
                            Meeting scheduled for late October. He said that the talk about the
                            possibility of a meeting between the Secretary and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> had had very bad
                            repercussions in Taiwan and elsewhere. It was the view of the Chinese
                            Government that it would be highly undesirable for the Secretary to
                            enter any conference with <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName> or to discuss any substantive matters with the
                            Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed, and said that the possibility of a meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> was very remote.
                            He had no such idea in mind. The matter had been brought up by persons
                            outside the State Department. <persName corresp="#p_GSWF1">Senator
                                George</persName> had become involved in the talk. The Secretary had
                            been asked at a Press Conference about the prospects. He had minimized
                            the possibility but had avoided a categorical “no” because he did not
                            like to talk in terms of “never”. Peiping had picked up this press
                            conference item. The President had then been asked <pb n="108"
                                xml:id="pg_108" facs="0136"/>about the matter. He had side-stepped
                            the question but had likewise refrained from using a categorical
                                “no”.<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">Reference is apparently to the

                            possibility altogether, and the speculation had snowballed. The
                            Secretary said that such a conference was the last thing in the world he
                            would plan. But he could not say flatly that no conference at that level
                            would ever take place. It was just conceivable that the proposition
                            might get out of control. However, it was his purpose to avoid a
                            conference at that level if at all possible.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> mentioned
                            the Chinese Communist desire to obtain a relaxation of the trade
                            embargo. He asked if the pressures on the U.S. to agree to a lowering of
                            trade controls were very great.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said yes, there was great pressure, from European countries
                            primarily and from Japan secondarily. There was a strong drive to make
                            the strategic list for Communist China correspond more closely to that
                            for the Soviet Union.<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">Reference is to the
                                lists of items subject to export controls by the countries
                                participating in the Coordinating Committee (<gloss
                                    target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>) and the China Committee
                                    (<gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>) of the Paris
                                Consultative Group of nations working to control the export of
                                strategic goods to Communist countries.</note> It was just possible
                            that the U.S. might have to make some slight concessions in order to
                            hold the major position. We much prefer to hold the line where it is.
                            But if we insist too rigidly on holding the higher level of China
                            controls precisely where it is, then the whole structure of multilateral
                            controls might collapse. It is better to make some minor concessions
                            than to jeopardize the multilateral system of controls. We would rather
                            write off 10% of the structure and save 90% than risk losing it all. Any
                            concession the U.S. might agree to would be a minimum in any case.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he understood that
                            in any event there would be no discussion of the trade embargo at Geneva
                            until Agenda Item One was completed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the U.S. would not carry on the talks if we were
                            convinced that the Chinese Communists were acting in bad faith on the
                            implementation of the Agreement under Item One. However the U.S. is not
                            insisting that all Americans must be released before we touch Item Two.
                            Already Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang Ping-nan</persName> are talking
                            about agenda items under Point Two.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was inclined to think that the Communists are
                            guilty of bad faith. They are not carrying out their obligations under
                            the Agreed Announcement. They are trying to show that the U.S. is guilty
                            of bad faith on Item Two. They apparently figure that <pb n="109"
                                xml:id="pg_109" facs="0137"/>if the U.S. does not proceed with
                            substantive discussions under Item Two they are entitled to renege on
                            the release of the Americans.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> asked if the U.S. was
                            willing to let the matter slide. Would the discussions be allowed to
                            drag on?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said, “Maybe so”. He saw no harm in continuing to talk,
                            although he supposed that it might make the Generalissimo and his
                            advisors nervous.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said, “That is putting
                            it mildly”. He said he was less nervous than many of his colleagues in
                            the Government since he felt he had a better perspective on the talks.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> had told him to
                            express the alarm of the Chinese Government at the continuation of the
                            talks. Any U.S. concessions would amount to giving the enemy moral
                            comfort and material assistance which would add to his capability for
                            seeking to destroy the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said, “You need to have some confidence that we are trying
                            to play the game along with you”. We can not and do not try to dictate
                            arbitrarily to our ally, the Chinese Government, although many people
                            apparently assume that we can do so. We want our Chinese friends to
                            accord us latitude to play the game as we think best. We are playing as
                            tough and astute a game as we possibly can. We do not believe the
                            Chinese could ask for more. The representatives of some Governments are
                            slipping on the basic China issues. The U.S. Government is using all the
                            pressure and influence possible to keep other Governments in line. When
                            we try so hard to hold the line against a rising tide in favor of
                            Communist China, we feel that we are entitled to your confidence. It is
                            discouraging if confidence is lacking, when we are working our fingers
                            to the bone in support of the Chinese Government. Some other Governments
                            have been working on the U.S. for two years, doing everything possible
                            to get us to weaken our position. We have used all sorts of devices and
                            stratagems to retain the support of other countries in maintaining the
                            international position of Nationalist China. It is not always
                            appropriate to tell the Chinese officials all the means that we use. We
                            have been surprisingly successful so far and we intend to keep trying.
                            The Secretary asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> to
                            tell his President that he should have faith in us. Great efforts are
                            being made to keep the pressures on the Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that he would like
                            to think aloud a little about the principle of not resorting to force.
                            He was not taking any position but exploring the subject. He thought the
                            Communists were following two lines simultaneously. <persName>Peng
                                Te-huai</persName><note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4">Vice Premier and
                                Defense Minister of the People’s Republic of China.</note> said at
                            Peiping in July that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> must
                            redouble its efforts to liberate Taiwan. This was after the Bandung
                            Conference, where <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> had
                            said he proposed <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0138"/>to solve the
                            Taiwan question by meeting the local authorities in Taiwan and treating
                            the matter as an internal problem to be solved by political methods. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said, “Suppose
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> agrees not to use force
                            in solving the Taiwan question and asks Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> for U.S. assistance in solving
                            the question by political means?” This was imaginary but it could
                            happen. How would the Secretary handle that matter?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we would maintain that the principles we advocate
                            for other partitioned countries should be applied uniformly. We might
                            propose free internationally supervised elections for China, including
                            the Mainland, such as have been proposed for other divided
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that the contest
                            might be unequal after the Chinese people have been subjected to six
                            years of Communist regimentation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> if
                            he thought for one moment the Communists would allow an outside
                            international body to come in and supervise free elections on the
                            Mainland? They would certainly throw the suggestion right out the
                            window.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he thought the
                            Communists would come up with some sort of proposal for agreement that
                            the Taiwan question should be solved by political means.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            expressed serious skepticism. They thought it was entirely contrary to
                            the Communist line as voiced in Moscow and Peiping. The Communists have
                            been consistent in opposition to any sort of two-China proposition.</p>

                            only two things were needed to restore peace in the Far East: (1)

                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> as head of a
                            Government of Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>At a later point in the conversation, the Secretary recalled that the two
                            Governments had various difficult problems in common At the moment the
                            most critical common problem was Quemoy and Matsu. There was little
                            doubt that the Chinese Communists could take these off-shore islands
                            against the strongest Chinese Nationalist resistance, if the resistance
                            were unaided. It was not at all certain that the United States could
                            come to the help of the Chinese Government in that situation. In fact at
                            the moment it seemed evident that the U.S. could not do so, because of
                            the temporary disability of the President. The President was not in a
                            position to exercise the judgment that would be required under the Joint
                            Resolution of last January, and no one else in the world was authorized
                            by Congress to exercise that judgment in his stead.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the Geneva talks were designed to help the
                            Chinese Government to keep Quemoy and Matsu. The U.S. Government does
                            not have any independent interest of its own in these islands. “It does
                            not give a hoot about them”. But we<note n="4" xml:id="d68fn4">“We” as
                                used in the Secretary’s remarks throughout this memorandum refers to
                                the Department or the U.S. Government. [Footnote in the source
                                text.]</note> know how you feel about them. So we are trying
                            desperately through diplomacy to enable you to hold these islands. We
                            are aware of your objections to the Geneva talks. If you told us that
                            you considered it more important to break off the talks than to retain
                            Quemoy and Matsu, we would arrange to terminate the talks as soon as you
                            were prepared to evacuate the islands. But you have 60,000 troops on
                            those islands. Your prestige is committed there. You are convinced that
                            the loss of these islands would be very bad.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he agreed that the loss of the islands would be bad.
                            It was better to keep the islands without having to engage in <pb
                                n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0140"/>a fight which would probably be
                            a losing one. We can not determine the course independently, nor can
                            you. It is a partnership with a common problem. The Generalissimo agreed
                            when the Mutual Defense Treaty was negotiated last November to exclude
                            the off-shore islands from the Treaty area. We have no Treaty obligation
                            to help in the defense of the islands. But we know that you consider
                            that the loss of these islands would have a very grave effect. So we are
                            trying by diplomacy to create a situation where you can keep the
                            islands. We can tell you in confidence that this aspect of the situation
                            is very much in our minds in connection with the Geneva talks. We are
                            trying to urge upon the Communists as to the Taiwan area a principle we
                            firmly believe in: the renunciation of force. The same principle, we
                            believe, should apply in other places, including the countries partly
                            occupied by Communist regimes and in places such as Goa and Northern
                            Ireland. We have said it to <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                            and to <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>. Chancellor Adenauer
                            of Germany has pledged not to use force to reunify his country. It is a
                            sound principle. Fortunately, the principle now operates to the
                            advantage of the Chinese Government in the Taiwan area.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> remarked that “If we
                            are to adhere to this principle, we must prepare for a long period of
                            ’political consultations’, to use the Communist term.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed. He said he had reminded <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Johnson</persName> that Panmunjom<note n="5" xml:id="d68fn5"
                                >Reference is to the negotiations to bring about a truce in the
                                Korean war, held at Kaesong and Panmunjom July 1951–July
                                1953.</note> took two years. It is slow business, and we will have
                            to get hardened to it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> recalled that it
                            took six weeks to get the Agreed Announcement. Any conference with the
                            Chinese Communists might well take at least six months.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that his
                            Government wanted to play the game astutely, too. The tactics should be
                            to cause the Communists to reconsider their position from time to
                            time—to push them back. The Secretary’s doctrine was difficult, because
                            it was well-known that the Americans were not noted for patience. The
                            general impression abroad was that the Americans would lose their
                            patience in time.</p>

                                authorized him to discuss subjects which might constitute agenda

                            referred to questions and/or suggestions on implementation I had raised
                            last meeting and hoped <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> had
                            replies this morning. He launched into long prepared statement terming
                            discussion of item two “thus far unsatisfactory”, were spending time on
                            “details” concerning agreed announcement and I was raising questions in
                            this regard to “prevent discussion substance item two”. Renewed
                            suggestions be discussed by assistants or through <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> Chargé Peking.</p>
                        <p>2. Then referring to my suggestion on subjects we discuss under item two
                            stated “each side may raise subjects it considers should be discussed
                            and not necessary to limit subjects or to fix their order”. There is no
                            necessity carry on any prolonged argument on subjects to be discussed,
                            “will not agree removal any subjects”, then went on with long
                            justification for discussion higher level meeting largely repeating
                            previous line. He then referred my two subjects stating he had already
                            given me list all Americans in China including military personnel, if by
                            raising subject I intended imply more Americans in China “this was sheer
                            fabrication”, we have not given them list of Chinese in US, if there is
                            to be any accounting of personnel up to US to do accounting.</p>
                        <p>3. Then turned to renunciation of force, should distinguish between civil
                            conflicts which outside scope of these talks and international disputes.
                            “Even in civil conflicts China had striven for peaceful solutions when
                            circumstances permit.” “<persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>

                            carries on harassing activities;” China has consistently upheld peaceful
                            settlement international disputes, consistently supported principles

                            international disputes, references to Bandung, Five Principles, etc.
                            “Chinese do not want to fight with US” and <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> said no fighting in Taiwan area between Americans
                            and Chinese. Therefore no question ceasefire between China and US. US is

                            national objectives, Taiwan is Chinese territory, was restored to China
                            World War II and yet US encroaches on and occupies and has said it will

                            discuss withdrawal all US forces from Taiwan and coastal islands. If I
                            fully empowered discuss and settle this question he ready to do
                            likewise. In closing referred my statement previous meeting I had faith
                            and hope and said he shared but “we would have to strive harder and
                            prove our desires by deeds”.</p>
                        <p>4. I said I first wanted to deal with implementation. I did not want to
                            spend time on details, did not see why it was necessary. All that was
                            required were simple answers to my simple questions, could be disposed
                            of in few minutes. In reply his suggestion on <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> taking up questions Peiping, pointed out agreed
                            announcement had two aspects: one, actions to be taken by our
                            governments which were intergovernmental matters between us, and two,
                            functions third powers. Words of agreed announcement resolved nothing,
                            only implementation resolved questions. Some of questions I had raised
                            also taken up by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in Peiping but no
                            satisfactory replies. Repeated in full three questions on whether
                            Americans in jail informed of text announcement, their access to <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Chargé, and authority <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Chargé interview them. Said simple
                            affirmative answers would immediately dispose of these questions here.
                            Difficult understand why he couldn’t give me simple answers, pointing
                            out his failure to do so was what was delaying talks. Then made detailed
                            statement pointing out none of remaining 19 yet released, could not
                            consider this faithful implementation of announcement, <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> failure give benefit agreed
                            announcement to imprisoned Americans makes it meaningless as far as
                            Americans in <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> desiring return are
                            concerned. In view of continued delay becoming more concerned over his
                            statement September 23 meeting implying persons in jail not covered by
                            provisions agreed announcement, could not accept any such construction
                            and asked for confirmation all American civilians whether or not in jail
                            covered by announcement. Could not agree to his implied interpretation
                            our not insisting on definite time limit for release constituted
                            agreement to indefinite delay in release. Must insist implementation
                            agreed announcement provisions for expeditious departure all Americans
                            who desire to return including those still imprisoned. His continued
                            reference to improved relations as factor in release could not but be
                            interpreted as intent disregard explicit terms of announcement and “to
                            hold these human beings as hostages for political advantage”. My
                            government had promptly implemented announcement and had not and would
                            not attach political conditions to carrying it out. Chinese have been
                            and still were free to leave. Failure his government match our
                            promptness in implementation was what was slowing progress talks.
                            Referring his previous statements on pressure, did not see why <pb

                            for <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> “to do what it publicly declared
                            in our agreed announcement it was going to do”.</p>
                        <p>5. He objected all my remarks as falling into item one and again raising
                            matters which already discussed and settled. <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> would “faithfully carry out agreement but would not
                            allow any distorted interpretation” of announcement. Will continue
                            review cases but action must be accordance Chinese law. Cases will be
                            reviewed “in light of” the agreement, degree of the offense, conduct and
                            improvement of relations. There was then much give and take until he
                            clarified and corrected interpretation of previous statement by saying
                            cases Americans being reviewed “accordance” agreed announcement and, in
                            light of discussion, I interpret as being satisfactory statement that
                            all Americans including those in prison included within announcement. I
                            also pressed him hard on other three questions and although his answer
                            vague and unsatisfactory with respect to specific assurance each
                            American in prison had been informed of announcement, reiterated
                            previous assurances wide publicity included measures to assure every
                            American informed. In spite continual pressure he flatly refused answer
                            other two questions saying this not the place for discussion. After long
                            and unsuccessful prodding I expressed hope he would assure me <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Chargé would promptly be given replies.
                            He kept repeating he had nothing more to say.</p>
                        <p>6. I then referred to remainder his statement and said I wished to study
                            and give detailed reply later. However I pointed out my suggestion on
                            order of discussion of subjects was designed to contribute to orderly
                            progress. I defined what I meant by US personnel by stating this
                            concerned American military personnel still missing from Korean
                            hostilities concerning whom there was reason to believe his authorities
                            had information. Then said considered renunciation of force most
                            important, therefore probably should be discussed first, and I would be
                            prepared say more on subject next meeting. Then repeated arguments
                            against higher level meeting stating nothing he had said this morning
                            had changed my mind.</p>
                        <p>7. He replied stating question US military personnel had been fully
                            covered at Panmunjom, no reason for raising it here, and if we did so he
                            reserved right raise question of US accounting for personnel detained in
                            Korean War. Repeated his arguments on higher level meeting as well as
                            statement that if I had full authority deal with “important and
                            outstanding questions arising in the Taiwan area” he was ready to
                            discuss.</p>
                        <p>8. I agreed his proposal next meeting Saturday, October 8. There was then
                            considerable argument on press communiqué, he insisting communiqué be
                            confined to statement we had continued discuss <pb n="116"
                                xml:id="pg_116" facs="0144"/>agenda item two, and I insisting on
                            previous communiqué we finally agreed on simply stating we had met and
                            give time next meeting.</p>

                                stated that although he thought the Chinese would find it extremely
                                difficult to make an open avowal of any change in their attitude
                                toward Taiwan, there were indications, such as the removal of signs
                                calling for the liberation of Taiwan from public places in Peking,
                                suggesting that they had abandoned the use of force to achieve their
                                objectives. He stated that, although U.S. agreement to higher level
                                talks might be termed capitulation or appeasement in some quarters,
                                such an agreement by the United States could only mean an act of

                                <p>“Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                                <p>I wish to thank you for your thoughtful letter of September 20
                                    expressing your gratification over the progress that has been
                                    made in the talks at Geneva.</p>
                                <p>The American people share the peaceful aspirations of the people
                                    of Burma. Our feeling regarding the prospects for the talks at
                                    Geneva is that further progress may be anticipated in proportion
                                    as our actions and those of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                        >PRC</gloss> create an atmosphere favorable to the
                                    development of confidence. We believe that one of the important
                                    actions which might promote a favorable atmosphere would be a
                                    fully reciprocal renunciation of the use of force in the Taiwan
                                    area in the pursuit of policy objectives. I know you appreciate
                                    the impossibility of progress in negotiations under the threat
                                    that one of the parties may resort to force. We believe that the
                                    removal of this threat should be the first order of business in
                                    our discussion at Geneva of ‘other practical matters’.</p>
                                <p>A second requirement for the development of an atmosphere of
                                    confidence is that whatever undertakings are reached in the
                                    talks <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0145"/>should be
                                    faithfully and promptly implemented. This applies specifically
                                    to the Agreed Announcement of September 10. For our own part,
                                    not only have we long since made it possible for any Chinese who
                                    wishes to return to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> to
                                    do so, but we have given the Indian Government full information
                                    relating to the performance of the functions undertaken by the
                                    Government of India in connection with the Agreed Announcement,
                                    and have offered the Government of India all facilities for the
                                    performance of its functions. Information about these and other
                                    measures taken by my Government in fulfillment of our
                                    obligations under the Agreed Announcement has been promptly and
                                    fully conveyed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                        >Wang</persName> at Geneva, in the hope that he would
                                    provide our Ambassador with similar information. So far, he has
                                    refused to do so, and the conclusion is inescapable that the
                                        <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> is, for the present, at
                                    least, failing to carry out its obligations under the Agreed
                                    Announcement. The Chargé d’Affaires of the <gloss
                                        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has been unable to secure any
                                    information about the status of the still-detained Americans,
                                    and not a single one of the imprisoned Americans has been
                                    allowed to communicate with him. The <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                        >PRC</gloss> announced on September 10, and subsequently
                                    carried out, the release of ten of twenty-nine detained American
                                    civilians. Since that time the <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                        >PRC</gloss> has taken no action looking toward the release
                                    of the remaining nineteen of whom eighteen are imprisoned.</p>
                                <p>I am deeply disturbed, and the American people are gravely
                                    distressed, by the continued imprisonment of these eighteen
                                    Americans in the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and by the
                                    continued denial of exit permits to others. This lack of
                                    fulfillment by the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> of the
                                    obligations assumed by it in the Agreed Announcement of
                                    September 10 is a most serious impediment to progress in the
                                    talks at Geneva. Indeed, if some measures are not soon
                                    forthcoming enabling the still-detained Americans expeditiously
                                    to return to the United States, it would become most difficult
                                    to credit any undertaking of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                        >PRC</gloss> on any subject. However, my Government has not
                                    reached the final conclusion that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                        >PRC</gloss> is acting in bad faith, and would reach such a
                                    conclusion only with the greatest reluctance. In answer to a
                                    question on this at my last press conference<note n="4"

                                    said ’… we are still holding to the belief that the Chinese
                                    Communists will carry out their agreement that all the Americans
                                    that are there are entitled to return and will be allowed
                                    expeditiously to exercise that right.’ In an atmosphere of
                                    confidence engendered by such evidence of good faith fruitful
                                    discussion of other practical matters at issue will be
                                    possible.</p>
                                <p>I believe you will agree that the two Ambassadors engaged in the
                                    talks at Geneva should be entirely competent to discuss the

                                    If either of the Ambassadors, on their level, should prove
                                    unable to furnish relevant information or discuss genuine
                                    practical issues, this would reflect the unwillingness of his
                                    Government to furnish this information or to have these
                                    questions discussed, rather than a need for a change in the
                                    level of the talks. Such unwillingness on the part of either
                                    Government would render conversations at any level pointless. I

                                proposed in telegram 817 from Geneva, October 5, shifting tactics at

                                concentrating on renunciation of force. Telegram 838 to Geneva
                                rejected this suggestion but authorized him to confine his remarks
                                on implementation to a “short but emphatic recall of total Chinese
                                Communist non-performance since September 10” and then to present
                                the U.S. statement on renunciation of force. It instructed him to
                                try to arrange future meetings at least a week apart, stating that
                                other demands on the Secretary and other senior officers of the
                                Department were so heavy that the developments at Geneva could not
                                be appraised and new instructions approved if meetings were held at
                                intervals of only 3 or 4 days. (Both <hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.,

                            two. Alleged I had violated secrecy of talks by informing press I had
                            raised subject missing military personnel.</p>
                        <p>3. In reply my brief rebuttal pointing out best my knowledge <gloss

                        <p>4. He made brief ad lib reply our renunciation of force statement using

                        <p>5. I replied briefly emphasizing importance and carefully considered

                            problems he and I called upon deal with here. Asked for careful study
                            and considered reply by his government.</p>
                        <p>6. He asked I be prepared next meeting discuss embargo. I pointed out my
                            statement today dealt with timing discussion this subject. In reply he
                            again rejected any concept of fixed order of discussion. I pointed out
                            today’s statement dealt with matter from important substantive aspect
                            rather than procedural.</p>
                        <p>7. With respect allegation on leaks to press replied both he and I knew
                            reports were not accurate, therefore clearly did not originate with me
                            but were probably assumptions based on earlier public statements made in
                            US even before beginning these talks. He did not pursue subject.</p>
                        <p>8. Next meeting Friday, October 14.</p>

                                    or more of small outlying islands close to Matsu in same pattern
                                    as employed in Tachens whenever they feel necessity for a
                                    victory, or in order to punctuate a development in foreign
                                    policy or put pressure on US. He points out that within last few
                                    days they have shelled such an island lying close to Matsu, and
                                    could probably take it without much expenditure of
                                    effort.</item>

                                >Chiang</persName>, he asked what subjects we wanted to discuss. I
                            first informed him of state of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>’s health and then took up subject of Geneva
                            Ambassadorial talks and our policy in regard thereto, assuring him in
                            strongest possible terms we would not engage in any discussions
                            affecting other countries without their full and equal participation.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> stated that he
                            himself understood policy perfectly, but expressed concern because the
                            average Chinese on Taiwan, overseas and behind Iron Curtain interpret
                            these talks as leading to recognition of the Communist regime; tending
                            to increase the prestige of the <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0150"
                            />Communists and lessening prestige Chinese Govt on Taiwan. He urged
                            especially that no higher level conferences be held. I pointed out our
                            primary concern for American prisoners still held by Communists and fact
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s procrastinating in their
                            agreement for expeditious release, which we are publicizing in
                            comparison to our own actions toward full compliance. I further noted
                            our strong position against higher level talks and any reduction of
                            trade embargo. He remarked that what we hoped to gain by such talks was
                            minor as compared with what we were sure to lose in world prestige. His
                            conclusion: The sooner talks with Communists stopped the better for U.S.
                            and China. He requested that his opposition to Ambassadorial talks and
                            those proposed at higher level be brought to Secretary’s attention. This
                            of course I promised to do.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> did not think that
                            the Secretary’s recent press statements to the effect that situation in
                            Formosa Straits had improved was warranted. I said I was not familiar
                            with particular statements he referred to, but we were doing everything
                            possible to eliminate activities of neutrals and intermediaries, which
                            was also one of primary reasons for Geneva talks.</p>
                        <p>In this connection President brought up question large air base being
                            built in Fukien obviously for bombing Taiwan. I stated that I would
                            personally recommend completion Kung Quan base on Taiwan as counter
                            measure upon my return to Washington.</p>
                        <p>On economic side President stated he was confused by fact that neutralist
                            and pro-Communist countries were still receiving U.S. aid, in many cases
                            in greater amounts than allies. He thought aid should be apportioned
                            with anti-Communist countries receiving highest priority. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> pointed out necessity of
                            advance planning and limitations on discretion imposed by Congress. He
                            expressed appreciation U.S. economic and defense aid and was happy that
                            defense aid now at highest point and hoped economic aid soon similarly
                            increased.</p>
                        <p>After dinner I had opportunity ask President if he had plans for return
                            of <hi rend="italic">Tuapse</hi>, stating we believed it was now perhaps
                            more of a liability than an asset. He replied that nothing was planned
                            until at least after Geneva Conference of Foreign Ministers, where
                            matter would be reviewed in light of world situation then existing. I
                            then requested his appraisal of political and military situation of
                            offshore islands. He replied briefly that (a) no change had taken place
                            since <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> visit, (b) his forces were
                            continuing to improve defenses and (c) an attack could be expected at
                            any time, although he refused to speculate on further details. Frank and
                            cordial atmosphere prevailed at conference and large dinner in our honor
                                <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0151"/>which followed. No new

                                agreed that the Taiwan situation had improved since Bandung and
                                stated that the Chinese hoped to solve the problem by peaceful means
                                but added that the situation might deteriorate at any time because
                                of harassing attacks on the mainland from Taiwan. He complained of
                                the U.S. refusal to proceed to agenda item two at Geneva, stating
                                that all Americans in China had been given the English text of the

                                pursued but stated that for the 19 “criminals”, the normal judicial
                                processes must be followed and that <persName corresp="#p_ONC1"

                                discussion under item two: the need for renunciation of force as an
                                instrument of policy, which the Chinese were prepared to discuss
                                along with their own two points, and missing <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                                >O’Neill</persName> said he thought it meant that Americans in

                            though it might not be worth much that he would not get entirely
                            negative reply. <persName>Chang</persName> repeated <persName
                                corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName>’s reference to visits to
                            prisoners without brushing it aside and as though it might be feasible.
                            He asked whether <persName corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName> had any
                            further questions to put and seemed almost surprised that <persName
                                corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName> did not have any. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName> adds in view of this it might
                            be desirable that at next interview he should put some further questions
                            if Americans so desire depending of course on manner in which interview
                            develops. <persName corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName> suggests that
                            he might ask for example on instructions how many of 19 have been tried
                            already and what their sentences are. He adds that he realizes State
                            Department may perhaps feel this would also be open to objection of
                            accepting principle of trial before release. <persName corresp="#p_ONC1"
                                >O’Neill</persName> remarks Americans may have been given this
                            information at Geneva already in which case he would be grateful to have
                            it.</p>

                        <p>85. 1. One hour forty minute meeting this morning. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> opened with long prepared statement
                            dealing exclusively with my last week’s statement on renunciation of
                            force. While relatively mild in tone consisted almost entirely rehash
                            previous positions. Said key to situation was withdrawal US forces from
                            Taiwan. Our proposal was “abuse of principle non-recourse to force”.
                            “Are you willing to discuss question withdrawal US forces from Taiwan?”
                            Liberation Taiwan “cannot be made subject present talks”.</p>
                        <p>2. I replied with statement on implementation along lines <gloss
                                target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 870<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2"
                                    ><ref target="#d75">Document 75</ref>.</note> and then expressed
                            disappointment lack of responsiveness his statement our proposal. I then
                            made statement using material latter portion para 2 <gloss
                                target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 870 and pertinent material
                            previous statement on renunciation force. There was then some give and
                            take during which both of us largely reiterated previous statements.
                            However he did not challenge my statement that I hoped I could interpret
                            his remarks as meaning he did not entirely reject our proposal. Towards
                            end he gave me opening which I used to close on theme of
                            implementation.</p>
                        <p>3. At close I proposed normal schedule weekly meetings and he agreed
                            subject next meeting being Thursday. Understanding is subsequent
                            meetings will be on Thursdays.</p>
                        <p>4. Am departing for Prague tomorrow morning returning Tuesday.<note n="3"

                                    negatively, our renunciation of force proposal. He made no

                                    reaction to my renewed discussion of implementation was very
                                    mild. In fact as will be seen from full meeting record, during
                                    give and take he perhaps somewhat inadvertently gave U.S. credit
                                    for full implementation agreed announcement. He also readily
                                    agreed to my proposal for normally weekly meetings. His manner
                                    and tone of delivery of his opening statement was also mild and

                                    conversation touched on a variety of subjects. The only
                                    reference to China in the memorandum of conversation, apart from
                                    the portion here printed, occurred during discussion of the
                                    problem of disarmament. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                        >Dulles</persName> said that while it was true that the

                                    Soviet Union undoubtedly had bases in the countries of Eastern
                                    Europe, and, moreover, “it could put forces in Communist China.
                                    Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said that he
                                    was not certain that it could do this. The Secretary said that

                                    correct, but that he thought that the Russians could put forces
                                    in Communist China.”</note></item>

                        <p>The Secretary said that the Geneva talks were not going particularly
                            well. We had reached an agreement with the Chinese Communists in Geneva
                            that the 19 Americans still held as prisoners in China would be
                            expeditiously permitted to exercise their right to return. They had not
                            yet been released and were, in fact, being held as political hostages.
                            The Chinese Communists’ action in this matter raised the question of
                            their good faith.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> commented that the
                            Indians had kept in touch with the Chinese Communists. He felt that
                            there had been a deterioration in the situation recently. The Secretary
                            replied that there had certainly been a deterioration from the point of
                            view of our side, as we were reaching the conclusion that the promises
                            made by the Chinese Communists were not reliable. We had agreed to
                            discuss “other matters” with the Chinese Communists in the Geneva talks.
                            Under this item of the agenda, however, the Chinese Communists had not
                            brought up any substantive matter, only that of a meeting between the
                            Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> interjected that he
                            thought that direct talks between the Secretary and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> would be useful. It was the only
                            way to settle outstanding issues affecting both countries. The Secretary
                            said that it had not been easy for the United States to hold the talks
                            at the present level. It had had a bad effect on our relations with the
                            Republic of China. We had agreed to discuss differences. The Chinese
                            Communists wanted to discuss holding <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130"
                                facs="0158"/>a conference at a higher level to discuss differences.
                            This did not seem to be an effective means of making progress in
                            talks.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Communists had raised the question of the embargo on imports
                            into Communist China. We had raised the question of United Nations
                            soldiers missing in the Korean war. Although our raising of this issue
                            seems to have been considered provocative by the Chinese Communists, we
                            did not so intend it. We merely want whatever information the Chinese
                            Communists could furnish with respect to the missing people, mainly in
                            order to clear our records and inform the families of the missing
                            persons. Such a procedure is normal and in accordance with the Geneva
                            Convention.</p>
                        <p>The second question which we had raised was the renunciation of force in
                            the Formosa area. This was directly related with the question of the
                            economic embargo of Communist China. It would obviously affect our
                            position with respect to the blockade if we knew whether the Chinese
                            Communists wanted to use commodities imported for a war or for peaceful
                            means. As he had stated to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> in a previous conversation, the Chinese Communists
                            say that Formosa is a part of China. However, the Korean Government
                            maintains that North Korea is a part of Korea; the Indians maintain that
                            Goa is a part of India. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> interjected to say that Goa was a part of India.)
                            The Secretary continued that in what he considered to be “a lofty move”
                            the Indians had renounced the use of force in connection with Goa. He
                            thought that the Chinese Communists might in the same way renounce the
                            use of force in the Formosa area.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> referred to recent
                            reports that the Chinese Communists were willing to let forty-seven
                            Americans leave China. The Secretary said that many of these were
                            “turncoats”. They did not want to come back and we did not want them to
                            come back. Some of them, he thought, were Americans in name only; many
                            were in reality expatriates. He wished to make a clear distinction
                            between these and the 19 imprisoned Americans who wanted to come back,
                            but who were being prevented from doing so by the Chinese
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed the hope that the Chinese situation would work
                            out. While his recent speeches had not yet been “cheered” by the Chinese
                            Communists, he had thrown out the suggestion in several of these
                            speeches that the Chinese Communists seemed to be changing. It was a
                            slow process, but there was at least ground for hope that the Chinese
                            Communists might gradually become convinced of the desirability of using
                            peaceful means to settle their international disputes. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said that the only objective of
                            India in connection with this problem was to try to be helpful. The
                            Secretary replied that India has been and can be in the future very
                            useful. He suggested that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> see if he could get <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131"
                                facs="0159"/>the 19 imprisoned Americans out of Communist China.
                            Their continued imprisonment raised the question of the good faith of
                            the Chinese Communists. He understood <persName corresp="#p_ONC1"
                                >O’Neill</persName>, the British Chargé in Peking, had held some
                            talks with the Chinese Communists regarding the prisoners.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said that the Chinese
                            Communists had to put the prisoners through the necessary legal

                            realized that the Chinese had to save face. He had no objection to their
                            carrying out their own legal processes in the release of the prisoners.
                            However, he thought that they should honestly go through these processes
                            and not hold these prisoners as political hostages. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> expressed the opinion that the
                            crux of the matter was that the Chinese situation should not be
                            permitted to blow up in violence. The Formosa question should be settled
                            by negotiation and not by force. He himself had not ruled out the
                            possibility of talks between <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> and the Chinese Communists. He emphasized that
                            he did not wish to pursue this question too forcefully; he did not wish
                            to distract the Secretary’s mind from the all important task of
                            preparing for the Geneva Conference.</p>

                        <p>He stated he had understood that we would not enter into any substantive
                            discussions of subjects under Item 2 of the Agenda until we were
                            satisfied that the implementation of the September 10th announcement had
                            been initiated in good faith. He was concerned that we had apparently
                            abandoned our firm position. I explained to him that we had not
                            abandoned Item 1 and would not do so until the last civilian had been
                            released. Furthermore that while both sides had listed subjects to be
                            discussed under Item 2, the only substantive discussion which had taken
                            place concerned the renunciation of force, to which the Communists
                            incidentally take violent exception. In other words, discussing the
                            renunciation of force in no way represented a weakening of our position
                            or a concession to the Communists viewpoint.</p>

                            the position that we should not have any discussions under Item 2 of the
                            Agenda until “the 19 Americans rotting in Communist jails have been
                            released”. He asked that I inform the Secretary of our conversation on

                                            is in effect a demand that US change its policy and
                                            abandon those whom it has pledged to defend from attack,
                                            under threat that armed force will be used if US does
                                            not accede to that demand. US does not intend yield to
                                            threat of force. Force is not an admissible means
                                            settling differences between us. US is not demanding
                                            that <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> alter its views

                            inadmissible in scope these talks and mere statement principle cannot
                            resolve tension in Taiwan area. Deeds, that is US withdrawal from
                            Taiwan, required. Repeated theme “circumstances permitting Chinese
                            government willing to strive for liberation Taiwan by peaceful means”.
                            In give and take he regularly spoke of “American invasion and armed
                            occupation of Taiwan”. Rejected any parallel between Taiwan situation
                            and other divided countries. <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> “will
                            never recognize status quo”.</p>
                        <p>5. I ignored challenge our policy and kept coming back to theme first and
                            fundamental step was non-recourse to force declaration to which his
                            reiterated reply was withdrawal US forces in implementation US
                            acceptance of principle non-recourse to force or threat of force.</p>

                            you but I hope that it may be of some value in contributing to your more
                            long range thinking back there. It is very much in the nature of
                            “thinking aloud” and represents distillation of many “bull sessions” we
                            have had here on the subject.</p>
                        <p>We have now for several meetings discussed primarily renunciation of
                            force. One of the things about which we have been puzzling is why
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> has been so willing to
                            drop his subjects and at least talk around our subject. One theory,
                            which I set forth in my telegram 924<note n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">Not
                                printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files,
                                611.93/10–2155)</note> of today, is that they are willing to see the
                            talks kept going either more or less indefinitely or at least through
                            the Foreign Ministers’ Conference and do not desire to take any steps
                            that would tend to bring matters to a head.</p>
                        <p>Another theory we have been discussing since I sent my telegram is that
                            they see in this subject possibility of pressing their undoubted desire
                            for the withdrawal of our forces from the Taiwan area within such a
                            framework, whereas they full well realize that its introduction as a
                            subject by them would have been rejected by us as outside the scope of
                            these talks.</p>
                        <p>This leads me to an attempt to analyze what their thinking may be with
                            respect to our renunciation of force proposal. Despite its surface
                            appearances, I believe the Chinese Communists may well view the proposal
                            as very unequal from their standpoint. They may well feel that it would
                            require them to make substantial political concessions while we are
                            making virtually none.</p>
                        <p>It would not increase the assurances which they now have from us against
                            military attack contained in our treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss>, our general obligations under the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter and our public statements. At the
                            same time we would continue to maintain in close proximity to them our
                            present heavy preponderance of air and sea power.</p>
                        <p>Also, the Chinese Communists may estimate that such a declaration would
                            carry with it for them the following other disadvantages: <list>

                                <item>It would carry with it a tacit acknowledgment of the existence

                        <p>None of the foregoing points seems very persuasive to me from their
                            standpoint, and I doubt if they outweigh what they consider to be the
                            disadvantages. My estimate of the situation at present is that I see
                            little or no possibility of their entering into such a declaration
                            unless it were accompanied by the withdrawal of our forces from Taiwan
                            or, much less likely, a firm commitment to a Foreign Ministers’ meeting.
                            I would not even be sure that they would enter into it even if both
                            things were done. I am also not sure where Quemoy and Matsu might fit
                            in. I certainly thus far have not perceived any support for the oft
                            repeated thesis that a ceasefire could be obtained in the Formosa Strait
                            if Matsu and Quemoy were turned over to them. However, by stretching
                            things a bit, one might be able to read into <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName>’s remarks thus far that they would be willing to

                            has never defined or been specific about this. I am not sure whether he
                            is talking just about the air unit which we have stationed there, which
                            is, I understand, our only tactical unit on the island, or whether he is
                            talking about the whole complex of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> and the Seventh Fleet.</p>
                        <p>It might be, as indicated in my today’s telegram, that they are willing
                            to keep these talks going indefinitely as an alternative to making
                            decisions on these problems which are even more difficult for them than
                            for us. However, it is too early to come to any firm conclusion on
                            this.</p>
                        <p>I am not sure where all of this leads us but simply wanted fully to share
                            with you some of our talk on the subject. If the opportunity arises, I
                            hope to talk some of these things through with the Secretary while he is
                            here, but before doing so would appreciate having <gloss target="#t_FE1"

                            opportune to attempt to assess the status of our relations with the
                            Government of the Republic of China. It is the impression of the
                            Reporting Officer that a deterioration of those relations occurred
                            during the summer. If so, the fault can scarcely lie entirely with the
                            Chinese, and it seems appropriate to review these events to ascertain
                            precisely what did occur, what might have been done differently, and
                            prospects for the future.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Overall Situation</hi></p>
                        <p>As for the overall situation, some observers of the local scene believe
                            that the cordiality of Chinese-American relations began to lose its
                            fresh bloom approximately a year ago. While most senior officials, and
                            most thinking Chinese, had at least subconsciously realized that the
                            United States was not going to assist the Chinese Government in its
                            objective of return to the mainland under present conditions, this
                            feeling had been unmentioned, inchoate, and intangible. The signing of
                            the Mutual Defense Treaty, however, brought the facts into focus, and
                            made it clear that we were not willing to accept this objective, nor to
                            commit ourselves to support it in writing. Our failure—indeed our
                            refusal—to include such a commitment in the Treaty itself made our
                            reluctance only too evident. It thus began to become more widely
                            apparent that Chinese and American policies were beginning to
                            diverge.</p>
                        <p>It is not startling that such a divergence of interests should occur;
                            such a development was in fact inevitable. As was mentioned in the final
                            paragraph of the Embassy’s secret despatch number 399 of February 3,
                                1953,<note n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">Portions of despatch 399, including

                            decision was whether Formosa should be considered simply a strategically
                            important island which should be denied to the Communists, or an
                            important factor which <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0168"/>could be
                            helped to play a significant part in the eventual liberation of mainland
                            China from Communist rule. Emphasis on the latter possibility would
                            bring Chinese and American policies more closely into line. The trend of
                            today, however, at least on the surface—with references to a
                            renunciation of the use of force in the Formosa Strait, to the new
                            “Geneva atmosphere”, etc, seems more toward the former alternative,
                            which is not and cannot be acceptable to the present Government of the
                            Republic of China.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the tides of history seem to be ebbing slowly away from, and
                            even turning against, the Nationalist Government. More and more
                            countries are moving towards recognition of the Peking regime, not only
                            Arab countries like Syria, but also—apparently—Canada, Belgium, France
                            and Italy.</p>
                        <p>If the United States is not to be left in isolation, it will have to make
                            some concessions to these developments, in the next few years, however
                            unwelcome the changes may be to our own people and principles. And any
                            such steps toward accommodation with the Chinese Communists are bound to
                            widen the small gap which is already visible between us and the
                            Nationalist Government on Taiwan.</p>

                        <p>This incipient tendency toward a split took on both practical form and
                            urgency, in mid-summer 1955, primarily because of developments in the
                            military field. First, the three senior officers of <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> were replaced simultaneously, with a
                            loss of continuity and of the personal relationships so important in
                            China. Second, the atmosphere in the Pentagon underwent a change and
                            hardened, judged by communications received in Taipei. Third, the
                            nine-reserve-division plan was approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            only with certain changes which turned out to be highly unpalatable to
                            the Chinese. This chain of events built up into the primary source of
                            friction with the Chinese Government; but there were other contributing
                            factors in both the military and economic fields, as will be
                            mentioned.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a detailed discussion of the three developments.]</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Geneva Conference, and
                            Talks</hi></p>
                        <p>Another evidence of diverging national policies came with the
                            announcement of the top level Geneva conference. The Chinese complaints
                            usually centered around fears that China was being subjected, or was
                            about to be subjected, to another Yalta “sell-out” (as the Chinese
                            consider it). However, after some initial grumbling this development was
                            accepted with fairly good grace.</p>
                        <p>When, however, at the end of the Summit meeting, it was announced that
                            the United States was to conduct conversations with the Red Chinese at
                            the Ambassadorial level, Chinese indignation <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141"
                                facs="0169"/>became acute. Here was further evidence of a basic
                            divergency in policy. Any conversations with the Red Chinese gave them
                            prestige and indicated their acceptance as a member of the international
                            family. These could only be gained by Communist China at the expense of
                            Nationalist China. The press editorials became more and more bitterly
                            resentful, despite the assurances in advance which had been given to the
                            Chinese Foreign Minister, and later announced publicly, that we would
                            not at Geneva discuss anything contrary to the rights, claims or
                            interests of the Nationalist Government, but would limit ourselves to
                            matters of bilateral interest. The newspaper campaign became shriller
                            and shriller till at last the Foreign Minister himself asked the
                            American Chargé d’Affaires to hold a press conference and try to calm
                            public indignation. This was done and while it occasioned one critical
                            editorial in Hong Kong, it seemed to have the desired effect locally.
                            Criticism continued, but became less emotional. Suspicion also
                            persisted, although there were also professions of confidence in
                            America’s fulfillment of its oral promises. Nevertheless, many Chinese
                            continued to feel that the United States had again sold China down the
                            river; or was about to do so. (This attitude of uncertainty still
                            exists.)</p>
                        <p>This was the main stream of developments which tended to sour
                            Chinese-American relations during the summer of 1955. However, there
                            were a number of contributory streams, both military and civilian, which
                            fed the main river of events. The military influences included the
                            occurrences at the Peitou military conference, the effort to have the
                            70,000 ineffectives removed from the Chinese armed forces and placed on
                            the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> (later <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                                >ICA</gloss>) payroll; and possibly the <persName>Sun
                                Li-jen</persName> case. These are treated in detail below.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a detailed discussion of military and economic contributing
                            factors.]</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Symptoms</hi></p>
                        <p>These were the factors and developments which contributed to the
                            deterioration of relations. The symptoms which appear to establish that
                            such a deterioration has taken place, are almost too numerous to
                            mention. They fall, of course, in both the civilian and military fields.
                            In the military field, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advice has
                            been increasingly ignored. The military budget was approved with
                            insufficient regard to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s
                            recommendations. When it was reviewed in an attempt to make reductions,
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> found places where
                            approximately NT$127 million could be cut. These matters came before the
                            59th meeting of the Economic Stabilization Board and apparently too much
                            frankness crept into the preparation and translation of the papers, for
                            one of them bore the notation that three items of expenditure, totaling
                                <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0170"/>NT$14 million, had been
                            approved by the Executive Yuan and would be made “with or without <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> agreement.”</p>
                        <p>Naturally, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advice is not always
                            going to be accepted; it is only advice. At the same time, if all or the
                            great majority of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s advice is
                            either rejected, ignored, or sabotaged in fact, then it can scarcely be
                            denied that our relations with the Chinese Government have deteriorated
                            from the level of loyal and free cooperation which previously existed. A
                            number of responsible <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officers
                            have expressed themselves in private as believing this to be the case.
                            The Chinese <gloss target="#t_G1">G</gloss>–3 who worked in close
                            collaboration with the Americans of the Army Section <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> suddenly disappeared. <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> inquiries elicited the fact that he
                            had been transferred, but there was no indication as to where he had
                            gone or why he had been moved. His replacement either speaks no English
                            or has been instructed not to carry on his business in that
                            language.</p>
                        <p>Officials of the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> Mission are equally
                            convinced that there has been a deterioration of their relations. The
                            principal area where this has been demonstrated has been in connection
                            with the budget. <persName>P. Y. Hsu</persName>, the Minister of
                            Finance, produced a budget which was far out of balance. As a result of
                            the third recalculation, he has now apparently brought the deficit down
                            to a manageable figure. Nevertheless, <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                                >ICA</gloss> points out that this is done through the juggling of
                            figures, and by milking government-owned enterprises to such a degree
                            that they will have to increase their bank loans, thereby adding to
                            inflation. With one breath the Finance Minister has announced that there
                            will be no increase of taxation; with the next breath he has prided
                            himself that the level of taxation on Taiwan is only 14% of national
                            income, or among the lowest in the world. While this 14% is undoubtedly
                            a considerable burden to the individual Chinese taxpayer, it is not much
                            consolation to Americans who are paying considerably more in income tax
                            alone. The Chinese military budget ceiling, which was conceived of as an
                            upper limit, and accepted as such by the military, has now become a
                            floor and there are repeated demands for increases in authorized
                            military expenditures, regardless of whether revenue therefor is
                            available or not.</p>

                        <p>The situation is neither desperate, nor irremediable. <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"
                                >CINCPAC</gloss> have given a tentative indication of willingness to
                            relax the stringent requirements imposed on the nine-division-reserve
                            program—and doubtless a compromise solution can be found, especially as
                            the Chinese are now also showing some resiliency (the Minister of
                            Defense states that he has ordered the recapture of certain diverted
                                <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment). Similar changes of
                            attitude, coupled with patience and understanding on our part, can
                            reduce the other national <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0171"
                            />differences to manageable proportions. Yet because of the Chinese
                            aversion to the Geneva atmosphere, their opposition to any renunciation
                            of the use of force in the Formosa Strait, their dislike and fear of the
                            “two Chinas” theory, and their sensing of a world-historical trend
                            contrary to their interests, differences of objectives will remain and
                            probably grow wider. The Chinese will probably be less amenable to
                            suggestions and persuasion in the future, than in the past when they
                            felt we walked really together, and in the same direction. It will
                            require our best skill to ameliorate the effects of these
                            divergencies.</p>

                                        regarding Taiwan, his accusation that US has occupied Taiwan
                                        by force of arms cannot be permitted rest unchallenged. You
                                        should briefly and factually state our position: that Taiwan
                                        is seat of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> which we
                                        recognize; that US has signed Mutual Defense Treaty with
                                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> under which we
                                        assumed obligations to assist in defense of Taiwan against
                                        outside attack; and that such units of US armed forces as
                                        are stationed on Taiwan are there in accordance with treaty
                                        provisions and with full consent of <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                            >GRC</gloss>. To describe this situation as “US armed
                                        occupation of Taiwan” is distortion of truth.</p>
                                    <p>You should then reiterate, along lines followed last meeting,
                                        that in best interests both countries and world at large
                                        urgent requirement is not to sit in Geneva arguing whose
                                        position right and whose wrong, but for both parties
                                        renounce use of force to settle differences, with particular
                                        reference to Taiwan area.</p></item>

                            and stated I would study and reply later concerning his draft
                            statement.</p>
                        <p>3. He replied with long ad lib statement “rejecting” my statement on
                            Taiwan. After some sparring and give and take I tried to probe further
                            for meaning para 4 his draft statement to determine whether it was any
                            move toward meeting our position on renunciation of force in Taiwan

                                En-lai</persName> formula they were somewhat more ambiguous than
                            previously. Replying to my specific question he stated para 4 “included
                            disputes between US and China in Taiwan area”. My specific probing on
                            significance his continued use “conditions permitting” with respect
                            “liberation” Taiwan led to no definite conclusion.</p>

                        <p>4. I then reverted to implementation in brief but strong terms to which
                            he replied my information was not current with respect ability <gloss

                            statement “rejecting assertion 450 Americans still allegedly being held”
                            and flatly refused accept lists.</p>
                        <p>6. I replied by pointing out I had not alleged 450 “still being held” but
                            was asking for information with regard to their fate. I then cited as
                            example case of Army Pfc. <persName>Paul E. Craig</persName>, pointing
                            out his specific mention in Peiping broadcast and that they could not
                            deny they had info with regard to him. If he were dead, all we were
                            asking was when and where. There was then long and increasingly
                            acrimonious discussion which I centered around facts in Craig case and
                            humanitarian aspects. He rehashed position on fourteen thousand and
                            reiterated entire matter should be taken up in <gloss target="#t_MAC1"
                                >MAC</gloss>. He claimed he had answered our query by giving us list
                            all Americans in China, including list last year all those who had died
                            in China. He made direct request for information on fourteen thousand. I
                            pointed out no relation between 14,000 and list 450, the case 14,000
                            analogous to Americans who remained their side and went to <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. I said his refusal accept list was not
                            in keeping with spirit our talks and made repeated efforts get him
                            accept. After I had pushed him into tight corner by continually coming
                            back to Craig case, he simply clammed up and refused to say anything
                            more. It was clear he was under categorical instructions not to accept
                            list and nothing I said was going to change this fact. Meeting closed on
                            this very hard note with my reserving right revert to matter.</p>

                                    in China. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> declared
                                    that the provisions of the agreed announcement should be carried
                                    out without further discussion at Geneva, that the Chinese had
                                    already given the United States a list of all U.S. nationals in
                                    China, and that the question of missing Americans from the
                                    Korean war did not fall within the scope of the Geneva talks.
                                    The U.S. proposal for a statement on renunciation of force would
                                    not settle the questions at issue, he maintained; the question
                                    of removal of tensions in connection with Taiwan should be
                                    discussed by the two Foreign Ministers. Since the Americans
                                    desired a joint statement, however, he said, the Chinese had put
                                    forward a draft. He gave <persName corresp="#p_ONC1"
                                        >O’Neill</persName> a copy to send to <persName
                                        corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, saying that he had
                                    given copies to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>
                                    and <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> and suggesting
                                    that it might be one of the bases for discussion by the Foreign
                                    Ministers at Geneva, if they should touch on Far Eastern
                                    problems. He declared that it should be possible to reach
                                    agreement on this and that if the Ambassadorial talks should
                                    drag on much longer, it would appear that the United States was
                                    not willing to agree. <persName corresp="#p_ONC1"
                                        >O’Neill</persName> referred to the two Americans who were
                                    being allowed to leave and expressed disappointment that there
                                    were only two, commenting that at that rate it might take over a
                                    year to solve the problem. He expressed the hope that the
                                    process could be speeded up. <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                        >Chou</persName>, apparently very irritated, interrupted to
                                    say that <persName corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName> was
                                    being unfair; it was not a matter of arithmetic but of politics.
                                    He pointed out that 37 Americans had been allowed to leave since
                                    July and contrasted the small number of Americans in China with
                                    the number of Chinese in America. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.,

                            coming to any conclusions. The Secretary has apparently not made up his
                            mind on how he wants to handle it, and clearly wanted to have time to
                            think about it, which was difficult with the extreme pressure on him of

                                    he described as follows:</p>
                                <p>“I gathered that he had talked with <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                        >Macmillan</persName> on the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                                        >CHINCOM</gloss> question and that he had come to the
                                    conclusion that some drop in the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                                        >CHINCOM</gloss> level, toward but not all the way to a

                                    inevitable.… We had some general discussion on how this could be
                                    tied in with my talks here but came to no conclusion, except
                                    that I gathered that it is the Secretary’s desire that if this
                                    development is in any event going to take place, I should
                                    attempt to capitalize on it here. I told him that, without
                                    expressing any opinion on whether or not the level should or
                                    should not be dropped, my strong feeling was that if we had come
                                    to the conclusion that it was going to be dropped, I thought it
                                    important solely from my standpoint here that it would appear we
                                    had agreed, or at least acquiesced, rather than that it had
                                    happened in spite of our opposition.” (<hi rend="italic"

                            feel it right that my temporary proximity to him here should operate so
                            as to cause him to give any undue weight to my opinions and without
                            having <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> opinions in front of him. This
                            gets to be a little difficult, but I want you to know that I have it
                            very much in mind, as I know he does. I am sorry that my 999 crossed
                            with your 1053.<note n="8" xml:id="d87fn8"><ref target="#d86"><hi

                            right as the Secretary had both messages in front of him yesterday and
                            he and <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Herman</persName> did up a <gloss

                                Geneva, October 31, commented on the instructions to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and expressed the view that
                                he should not present a counterproposal on renunciation of force at
                                the next meeting but should probe the meaning and application of the
                                Chinese proposal. It further stated that because of heavy pressure
                                for the reduction of trade controls, which was likely to become
                                “irresistible” in the near future, it was important to use this
                                bargaining point in the ambassadorial talks and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> should therefore use the

                        <p>The one specific question which I particularly desired to, and did,
                            discuss with the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_PH1"
                                >Herman</persName> Friday evening was this: As I told him, it seemed
                            to me that in the context of our talks my continued reference to “other
                            matters” which could be more hopefully discussed following a
                            satisfactory renunciation of force statement included, in <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s mind, the presence of our forces
                            in the Taiwan area. As I told the Secretary, I have very carefully
                            avoided any specific statements and have carefully kept to simply the
                            “other matters” formula. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> has
                            also not pressed me to be specific in this regard but he might well do
                            so. In any event I want it to be clear in my own mind as to whether we
                            would admit to discussion of the presence of our forces in the Taiwan
                            area as an “other matter” if there were the satisfactory renunciation of
                            force statement. Admitting to discussion, of course, would not carry
                            with it any implication that we might be willing to agree with their
                            demand for withdrawal or otherwise accept their point of view. However,
                            I said it seemed to <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0179"/>me that it
                            would, as <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Herman</persName> phrases it, carry
                            with it an implication of willingness to “bargain in good faith” and not
                            simply sit and say “No”. I particularly raised the question as to
                            whether any such discussion would be within the agreed scope of our
                            talks or whether it would be something involving the rights and
                            interests of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and, therefore,
                            outside the scope of our talks.</p>
                        <p>I believe the Secretary’s view can be summarized as follows: We cannot,
                            of course, give any consideration, under present conditions, to
                            withdrawal of all of our forces from the Taiwan area. Apart from any
                            other considerations, the presence of at least symbolic forces is
                            essential for the maintenance of morale on Taiwan. However, the United
                            States has no desire to maintain forces in forward positions except as
                            we consider essential in the light of our estimate of security situation
                            in the particular area. This policy has been demonstrated by a reduction
                            of strength in Korea and Japan. Similarly, the forces we maintain in the
                            Taiwan area will be dependent upon our estimate of the security
                            situation in that area. If the Chinese Communists unequivocally renounce
                            force in the Taiwan area and otherwise demonstrate their peaceful
                            intent, it could be expected we would give consideration to unilateral
                            reduction in whatever strength is being maintained by us in the area.
                            This would be a purely unilateral act on our part and not subject in any
                            sense to agreement with the Chinese Communists. Such decisions on our
                            part do not involve the rights or interests of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> nor our agreements with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Therefore, “discussion” of the subject
                            with <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> in the light of the foregoing
                            could be admitted to.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing is merely my reconstruction of dinner conversation in which
                            the Secretary was simply thinking out loud, and I am passing it on to
                            you simply in that context.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> draft that I am not clear on how
                            I am going to handle in debate is that the 4th paragraph is very
                            cleverly and carefully confined to disputes between <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and the US. Thus, it is strictly within
                            the agreed scope of our talks. What we want, of course, is for their
                            renunciation to include the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>,
                            including Quemoy and Matsu. How do I justify this within the agreed
                            scope of our talks? Is this not something which involves the rights and
                            interests of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            relations? Another factor that occurs to me is if the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> has renounced force as between itself
                            and the US, how could it attack Taiwan as long as US forces are there
                            without clearly breaching its renunciation of force with the US? <pb
                                n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0180"/>Of course this leaves Quemoy
                            and Matsu out. The Foreign Ministers’ Conference is, of course, easy to
                            handle as they are in an insupportable position in attempting to make
                            any renunciation of force conditional upon the Foreign Ministers’
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>I am sure of only one thing: there is room for much and long discussion
                            during which I will need all the ideas that you can give me.</p>

                                almost certainly will not agree to the creation of “two Chinas” and
                                will resist moves to stabilize the Taiwan Strait situation as a

                            <item>Over the longer run, Nationalist China’s international position
                                and prospects will probably continue to deteriorate. With the
                                passage of time and in a period of reduced tensions, the “return”
                                theme would be increasingly recognized as unrealistic. Nevertheless,
                                the National Government would find it extremely difficult to accept
                                the idea that the Chinese on Taiwan must resign themselves to an
                                insular existence. However, unless they can make this psychological
                                adjustment and give higher priorities to domestic problems,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> or his eventual
                                successor may not be able to sustain unity and morale or to maintain
                                the economy. In any event, the survival and future fortunes of the
                                National Government will continue to be determined in large measure
                                by US policy, and will depend increasingly upon the scale and
                                character of US aid and support. (<hi rend="italic">Para.

                            <item>Despite the gradual increases that have taken place in the combat
                                capabilities of Nationalist ground, naval, and air forces over the
                                past several years, these capabilities are still far outweighed by
                                those of Communist China. Even if Nationalist military capabilities
                                are substantially improved, outside logistic, air, and naval support
                                will continue to be required to defend Taiwan or the Penghus against
                                Communist invasion. Nationalist strength will continue inadequate to
                                defend the offshore islands against determined Communist attacks.

                            minutes with statement on implementation in which I made points

                            are faithfully implementing and details should not be discussed
                            here.</p>
                        <p>2. I then made long extemporaneous statement on renunciation of force
                            during which I picked up points from our original presentation this
                            subject and asked whether and how their draft met. I strongly pointed
                            out importance full meeting of minds this vital subject rather than
                            vague formula of words which had one meaning to one side and another
                            meaning to other side. I particularly focused on practical situation in
                            Taiwan area and question was whether <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                            would resort to use of force in Taiwan area, except defensively, and
                            whether <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> accepted principle that use
                            of force to achieve national objectives does not accord with accepted
                            standards of conduct under international law. I pointed out that if
                            principle non-recourse to force a sound one it was sound for its own
                            sake and it was not proper to link it with any particular form for
                            negotiation. Foreign Ministers were not normal and usual channel for
                            discussions between governments. Was <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                            position peaceful discussion disputes could be had only between Foreign
                            Ministers? I then turned back to and reviewed our original proposal.</p>

                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> replied with prepared
                            statement, upon which he subsequently expanded, reiterating previous
                            position on Taiwan but drawing somewhat harder line between domestic and
                            international affairs and “rejecting my metaphors” comparing other
                            divided countries with China. During extemporaneous remarks he said
                            their draft “met the spirit” of my proposal. He said US has said it
                            could not speak for <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> and
                            they could not accept that we should do so. He reiterated “conditions
                            permitting” formula on “liberation”. He said “cannot agree to touching
                            on any Chinese internal affair in any public announcement”. Foreign
                            Ministers meeting not necessary if I “am fully authorized and could
                            assume responsibility settle question withdrawal US forces from Taiwan
                            area”. I closed long discussion this subject on note that whatever
                            differing views on Taiwan situation, did <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> recognize fact that initiation use of force in Taiwan
                            area would endanger international peace? He dodged question.</p>
                        <p>4. I then made statement on missing military personnel giving details

                            asking him accept lists. When he again rejected list as well as
                            discussion of subject, I said immaterial whether information given us
                            here or in <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss>. Asked whether <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> would instruct <gloss target="#t_MAC1"
                                >MAC</gloss> rep to discuss subject and accept list, whose refusal
                            thus far to do so had necessitated my raising question here. He refused
                            commit himself.</p>
                        <p>5. I then made statement on trade<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3"><p><persName
                                        corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> transmitted the text of
                                    the statement in his detailed report of the meeting in telegram
                                    1056 from Geneva, November 3. He stated that “my response to the
                                    questions which you may raise under your item of trade embargo
                                    must greatly depend upon the degree of agreement which we are
                                    able to reach with respect to renunciation of force” but that,
                                    while the question of renunciation of force was being
                                    considered, he would, in the interest of expediting their
                                    discussions, be glad to hear <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                        >Wang</persName>’s views with respect to trade. He
                                    contrasted this with <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                    >Wang</persName>’s unwillingness to discuss the question of
                                    missing military personnel. He continued as follows:</p>
                                <p>“In discussing the matter of trade at our meeting of September 14
                                    you referred to what you termed ’economic blockade and embargo
                                    imposed by U.S.’. I am not clear as to what you have in mind in
                                    this regard. I know of no blockade and I know of nothing imposed
                                    by the U.S. on anyone else.</p>
                                <p>“I do know of various sovereign measures taken by my government
                                    with respect to economic intercourse between my country and your
                                    country. I also know of common measures taken by several other
                                    countries in consultation with each other as well as with the
                                    United States concerning the export to your country of strategic
                                    materials. I also know of the resolution of May 18, 1951, by the
                                    General Assembly of the United Nations recommending an embargo
                                    on the shipment to your country of arms, ammunition, implements
                                    of war and other strategic materials.</p>
                                <p>“Therefore, when you present the views of your government, I hope
                                    that you will clarify exactly what aspects of this matter you
                                    have in mind.” (Department of State, Central Files,
                                    611.93/11–355)</p></note> for which he obviously entirely
                            unprepared and at end of meeting asked me for copy of statement as they
                            had at beginning failed to take full notes. We observed this was in fact
                            case and are sending him copy of statement this afternoon.</p>

                        <p>6. At end of meeting he asked reasons personal convenience next meeting
                            be Tuesday November 8. I explained I had already made other plans which
                            difficult to change but would meet Friday November 11 if he preferred.
                            He quickly and courteously agreed to meeting Thursday November 10.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Bowden</hi>: With reference to our
                            conversations of October 18 and 31, and to your letters of October 24
                            and 26,<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">Neither found.</note> I have made a
                            preliminary study of the economic problems mentioned as illustrating our
                            current differences with the Chinese Government. I appreciate the
                            trouble that you have taken to assemble this material.</p>
                        <p>As of possible use to others in your mission, I shall cover in this
                            letter more or less the same ground as in our recent conversations, with
                            some elaboration on a few points. First, I would refer to a statement in
                            your briefing for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>
                            at the Embassy on October 9 that there has been a “steady decline in
                            Chinese Government cooperation since the signing of the Mutual Defense
                            Pact.” Again, in your report of October 31, “<gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss>1957 Illustrative Program Narrative,”<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d91fn3">Not found.</note> the discussion of Conflict of
                            Objectives includes a reference to a “growing lack of cooperation by the
                            Chinese Government and an increasing disregard of <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> recommendations.” After the briefing on October 9 I
                            remarked to <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> and Moyer
                            that while as far <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0186"/>as I knew
                            your presentation was factual, I myself would have dealt with the matter
                            in a more optimistic tone.</p>
                        <p>After reexamining the material in question I want to call attention to
                            certain implications as to cause and effect. For example, so far from
                            having contributed to a deterioration of our working relations with the
                            Chinese, I believe that the Mutual Defense Pact in all probability
                            prevented a considerably more serious worsening in the field of
                            cooperation. Developments of the past year, aggravating the longer term
                            trend of events, might well have produced an all but disastrous
                            situation here had it not been for the formal United States commitments
                            in the Defense Pact.</p>
                        <p>As to the longer term trend, it is only prudent to expect a gradual
                            deterioration of Chinese Nationalist morale and of the quality of their
                            cooperation with us. This trend became evident some time after the
                            Korean Armistice in July 1953. Prior to that time, the war in Korea was
                            pinning down and draining a major part of Chinese Communist military
                            strength, relieving the pressure on Taiwan accordingly, and while the
                            fighting in the north continued there was at least a possibility of the
                            internal collapse of the Peking regime and/or an extension of
                            hostilities to South China under circumstances favorable to a successful
                            Nationalist participation. The Korean Armistice changed all of that. It
                            substantially reduced the drain on Red resources in Korea and permitted
                            the redeployment of large Communist land and air forces to areas from
                            which Taiwan (and other regions) could be threatened.</p>
                        <p>As it became apparent that the Korean Armistice marked the end of active
                            hostilities in that area for the foreseeable future, it was borne in on
                            the Free Chinese that the long term trend was once more against them.
                            The enthusiasm generated by the renewal of large scale American aid in
                            1951 started to wear off when it became apparent that, despite the
                            continuation of this aid, the disparity in military and other
                            capabilities as between Red and Free China again began to widen rapidly
                            after mid–1953. This meant not only that the possibility of liberating
                            their homeland seemed to recede into the dim future, but also that the
                            prospects of holding on to Taiwan itself for any considerable period
                            became distinctly less bright. No matter what the Chinese Communists
                            might conceivably promise by way of renouncing force, they would never
                            give up their aim of possessing Taiwan and liquidating the Nationalist
                            Government by whatever means they might choose. Under the circumstances
                            obtaining since the Korean Armistice, only a continuation of the firmest
                            and fullest United States support for Free China could postpone the evil
                            day.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese on Taiwan are very much aware that the United States wrote
                            them off once before; they do not exclude the possibility of our doing
                            so again. They believe, with some justification, that <pb n="159"
                                xml:id="pg_159" facs="0187"/>important and influential elements
                            inside and outside our Government would like nothing better than a
                            plausible excuse to sell Free China down the river. These elements
                            include isolationists, Europe-firsters, fellow-travelers and others who
                            for one reason or another continue to hate the guts of <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>. The Chinese believe
                            that such elements are more numerous and influential among Democrats
                            than among Republicans; hence their fear of a possible Democratic
                            victory at some future election.</p>
                        <p>No intelligent Chinese personages of my acquaintance expect the United
                            States to undertake a commitment to put the Nationalist Government back
                            on the Mainland. They simply hope that future events will produce a
                            situation in which we will want to do so in our own interest. (I believe
                            that we also should not exclude this possibility entirely, however
                            remote it may seem at present.) To reassure the Free Chinese as to
                            United States intentions subsequent to the Korean Armistice, however,
                            particularly after we had offered the Republic of Korea a Mutual Defense
                            Pact to make the armistice less unpalatable, it appeared essential to
                            conclude a similar agreement with the Republic of China. The first steps
                            were taken late in 1953 and the pact materialized something more than a
                            year later. Despite its limitations, this treaty commits the United
                            States, both expressly and by implication, to a more definite and longer
                            term policy toward Free China than we had ever acknowledged previously.
                            Bi-partisan support in the Senate provided an earnest of overwhelming
                            Democratic as well as Republican approval. Without this pact I believe
                            that the present situation in and around Taiwan would be precarious
                            indeed.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the foregoing, I consider it important that we should not
                            exaggerate the conflict of objectives between the Chinese and ourselves.
                            They and we have a common goal which lies on the road, but only part
                            way, toward their ultimate ambition. We shall not reach this nearer,
                            common goal for several years, during which time events may well require
                            both countries to modify their policies and programs to an important
                            degree. I see no evidence of deliberate intent on the part of the
                            Chinese to neglect the development of Taiwan in order to speed a “return
                            to the mainland”. Rather, they are much inclined to spend more money and
                            other resources on both projects than they and we have available. I
                            believe, therefore, that despite a probable further decline in
                            Nationalist morale over the next two or three years, and a concurrent
                            deterioration of their cooperative inclinations, our interests and
                            theirs during this period will be similar enough to permit the
                            successful prosecution of our aid programs.</p>
                        <p>With due allowance for the longer term factors which seem now to be
                            working against us here, and for the unfortunate psychological effects
                            on Free China of events at Geneva and elsewhere, I am inclined <pb
                                n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0188"/>to believe that our recent
                            difficulties are explained in large part by incidental and transitory
                            developments. There have been a number of shifts in key American
                            personnel in recent months, as well as changes on the Chinese side.
                            There has been a very rapid increase in the total number of official
                            Americans in Free China, to a point where our administrative, morale and
                            indoctrination problems seem to have become really serious for the first
                            time on Taiwan. There have been great delays in approving our <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>1956 aid programs; the fiscal year may be
                            half gone before we know how much we have to spend. United States funds
                            made available by Congress well over a year ago to finance the
                            separation of ineffectives, and to support a reserve training system,
                            remain unspent because our study of the question, both military and
                            economic, has involved long delays. Finally, the transfer of Direct
                            Forces Support responsibility from <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                            continues to tie up all counterpart funds needed for this essential
                            purpose. Meanwhile, accelerated arrivals of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1"
                                >MDAP</gloss> equipment, emergency needs of <gloss target="#t_USAF1"
                                >USAF</gloss> units and other factors have resulted in largely
                            increased requirements for local currency. It is perhaps scarcely
                            surprising that the Chinese are experiencing some frustration in recent
                            months, and that they have been rather less than prompt in putting
                            various parts of their own house in order.</p>
                        <p>I believe, therefore, that it will be necessary to tie up quite a number
                            of loose ends before giving consideration to a “high level” approach to
                            the Chinese on the general subject of cooperation with Americans. Such
                            approaches are likely to be useful only when some broad question of
                            policy can be solved thereby, which does not seem to fit the present
                            case, or when officials dealing with some important and specific problem
                            seem to require a push from above. In the near future, of course,
                            something in this latter category may need to be done.</p>
                        <p>First, however, I suggest that we concentrate our efforts with the
                            appropriate Chinese officials on certain specific matters of major
                            importance mentioned in your letters, notably the financial problems of
                            the Food Bureau and of the Power and Sugar Corporations; also the
                            dispersal program. I propose to see the Finance Minister shortly in this
                            connection and to follow up with calls on the Governor, the Prime
                            Minister and the President if necessary. Meanwhile, I suggest that your
                            mission select perhaps two or three of the most promising sources of tax
                            revenue, from those mentioned in Arndt’s April 22 letter to the Finance
                                Minister,<note n="4" xml:id="d91fn4">Not found in Department of

                            which we can all press the Chinese to adopt.</p>
                        <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0189"/>
                        <p>On the subject of budget balancing, I fear the subject has become so
                            complex that a fresh approach may be called for. Certainly, many of the
                            loose ends mentioned in an earlier paragraph will have to be tied up
                            before we know where we or the Chinese stand. I believe, however, that
                            we should give consideration to the possibility of reverting to an
                            earlier conception of financial aid. This would involve the elimination
                            of any general budgetary support as such by the United States, and the
                            placing of all counterpart expenditures on a strict project basis. I
                            would go even further in an effort to get our fingers out of as many
                            minor pies as possible, so that we might concentrate on the most
                            important parts of our program. This should have the effect of fixing
                            full responsibility, financial and other, on the Chinese themselves in
                            most fields. As a partial offset we might have to assume a somewhat
                            larger share of the burden in economic development, while continuing
                            such technical assistance as seems to promise really worthwhile
                            results.</p>
                        <p>On the military side, it may not be feasible for the near future, but I
                            would favor working toward a situation where the Chinese would assume
                            full responsibility for pay, food, clothing, general administration and
                            maintenance in their military establishment. The United States
                            contribution would be limited to equipment and supplies not available
                            locally, plus the services of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and
                            the financing of any special projects which we considered essential. The
                            latter would include all counterpart expenditures for military
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>In addition to simplifying our own operations, any steps which place
                            responsibility squarely on the Chinese should be beneficial both to them
                            and to the United States. At present, responsibility is so diffused in
                            so many fields that unless the trend toward even greater complexity can
                            be reversed, we cannot hope to deal effectively with the financial
                            problems confronting us. As a part of any program to fix responsibility,
                            it would seem essential that, once a budget had been fixed, no
                            additional outlays at either American or Chinese instance would be
                            undertaken without full prior consultation and the provision of new
                            funds for the purpose. If additional sources of money from current
                            revenues or additional American aid were not immediately available,
                            joint consideration would be given to postponing projects already
                            included in the budget so that the necessary funds could be transferred.
                            As a corollary to the foregoing, Americans and Chinese would have to
                            agree not to resort to additional bank loans except by mutual consent.
                            If this sounds like too much American interference, it may be recalled
                            that we are now covering about two-thirds of all public expenditures in
                            and for Free China; also, that even after our present program of
                            reequipping their Armed Forces (say, in 1958) is completed, the
                            prospects are that we shall still <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162"
                                facs="0190"/>be called upon to contribute at least half of the total
                            during an indefinite future.</p>
                        <p>At the same time I am convinced that still larger numbers of American
                            officials looking over Chinese shoulders and putting fingers into still
                            more pies do not provide an answer to our problems. In fact, I believe
                            that we have already too many official Americans in most agencies here,
                            with the result that the law of diminishing returns has begun to operate
                            and is responsible for a part of our increased difficulties during the
                            past year. What we need is a simplification of our effort, with greater
                            concentration on what is most important, and a concurrent plan to give
                            the Chinese greater and more definite responsibility.</p>

                                        <item>“1. The Ambassadors of the United States of America
                                            and the People’s Republic of China in the discussion of
                                            the practical matters at issue between the two sides
                                            have recognized that the two countries confront each
                                            other with policies which are in certain respects
                                            incompatible. Their governments are determined, however,
                                            that their first objective will be to see that these
                                            differences do not lead to armed conflict.</item>
                                        <item>“2. Their determination not to resort to war does not
                                            mean that either government must renounce any policy
                                            objectives which it considers it is legitimately
                                            entitled to achieve or renounce the right of individual
                                            or collective self-defense. It does mean that neither
                                            will initiate the use of force to implement its
                                            policies.</item>
                                        <item>“3. Their determination not to resort to the use of
                                            force to make the policies of either party prevail over
                                            those of the other does not involve the interests of
                                            third parties nor does it involve the justice or
                                            injustice of conflicting claims.</item>
                                        <item>“4. They recognize the basic principle that the use of
                                            force to achieve national objectives does not accord
                                            with accepted standards of conduct under international
                                            law if it constitutes a threat to international peace
                                            and security and justice.</item>
                                        <item>“5. Furthermore, they recognize that the determination
                                            not to resort to the threat or use of force is essential
                                            to the just settlement of disputes by peaceful means,
                                            for negotiations cannot achieve fair and equitable
                                            solutions if conducted under the overhanging threat that

                            Communist China saying that while Yugoslavia had not known too much
                            about the country they were in a position to study it first-hand since
                            the establishment of diplomatic relations.<note n="3" xml:id="d95fn3">In
                                January 1955.</note></p>
                        <p><persName>Tito</persName> insisted Communist China was not a Soviet
                            satellite. Although the Soviets had exercised great influence over
                            Chinese Communists, Stalin had complained <persName corresp="#p_MT1"
                                >Mao</persName> was difficult to deal with during the partisan
                            period. Soviets adopted a rather cautious attitude towards the Chinese.
                            While they were helping China economically and technically, it was wrong
                            to think the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was pushing China as
                            its spearhead for Asian penetration.</p>
                        <p><persName>Tito</persName> was sure Soviets exercised at times a
                            restraining influence on Chinese, commenting that regime was young and
                            in full flush of revolutionary fever which sometimes caused it to run a
                            bit wild. He believed the Chinese have learned some lessons and were now
                            wiser. <persName>Tito</persName> advocated Communist China’s admission
                            to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on grounds it was important for it
                            to have wider political and economic contacts and not to be forced into
                            position whereby having relations [only] with <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. China also could provide a wide market for many
                            countries including the US. <persName>Tito</persName> commented that
                            just as China had showed some elasticity in its international affairs so
                            it might show similar elasticity in foreign policy which would not
                            exclude difficulties with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>According to <persName>Tito</persName> the Chinese Communist Party while
                            having relations with Soviet Communist Party was quite independent and
                            certain pro-Russian elements had been largely eliminated. Party
                            relationships were equivalent to government relationships between the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and China.
                                <persName>Tito</persName> added his conclusions corresponded with
                            views he had received from Burmese and Indians during his trip East. At
                            this point Kardelj<note n="4" xml:id="d95fn4">Yugoslav Vice President
                                Edvard Kardelj.</note> said he knew from Stalin that latter was
                            opposed to <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> taking over China
                            by open revolution. It was paradox <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167"
                                facs="0195"/>that Yugoslav and Chinese Communist revolutions which
                            were completely successful were carried out against Stalin’s wishes,
                            because Stalin wanted all countries engaged in revolution to be
                            dependent on Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Secretary explained US feeling against Chinese Communists deriving from
                            their Korean intervention and efforts take over Indochina. Present
                            situation in South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia was such that these areas
                            had good prospect of remaining free. Threats against Taiwan were another
                            cause of American sentiment. Secretary briefly outlined <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>’s Geneva talks with Chinese
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>. If satisfactory
                            progress could be made by two Ambassadors regarding a reasonably
                            dependable renunciation of force, we would all be much better off. A
                            change of American sentiment, however, would depend on actions and words
                            of Chinese Communists. Secretary felt Geneva talks between Ambassadors
                            were useful but they would take time to arrive at result we hoped for
                            and he was therefore, not disturbed at their leisurely pace.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion Secretary emphasized our loyalty to Chinese Nationalists
                            who stood with us against Japanese. We have obtained <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> agreement not act against
                            Mainland except in agreement with us, thus giving us power of control
                            over Chinese Nationalist action. Last January risk of war had been grave
                            because of Chinese Communist attitude. Secretary referred to
                            congressional resolution empowering President to use US armed forces to
                            assist in Taiwan defense; said situation had improved since then but
                            Chinese Communists must realize American people still harbored strong
                            feelings not because they were Communist regime, since we had good
                            relations with Yugoslavia which was a Communist regime, but because of
                            Chinese actions and threats in Far East.</p>

                                Department of State files.</note> in which you detailed various

                        <p>The difficulties in question obviously are not easy to solve. In fact,
                            many of them simply illustrate continuing problems which we must follow
                            and deal with as best we can for an indefinite future period of time. In
                            view of this and of the complexities of the situation, as noted in
                            numbered paragraph 4 of your letter, it seems to me particularly
                            important that we should give special attention to factors of major
                            importance which involve large sums of money and affect the economy
                            accordingly. I cite the following as examples: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item><hi rend="italic">Increased Tax Revenues</hi>. There appears
                                    to be general agreement that tax revenues have increased less
                                    rapidly than national income in recent years. Obviously, steps
                                    should be taken to tap this source, both to provide your
                                    Government with much needed additional revenue and also to
                                    combat inflation.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item><hi rend="italic">Financial Position of Power and Sugar
                                        Corporations</hi>. These two companies are among your
                                    Government’s most important economic assets. Both have monopoly
                                    positions and both appear to be well managed as far as their
                                    general operations are concerned. At the very least, they should
                                    provide from current earnings enough to cover normal
                                    depreciation charges and to contribute to the Government no less
                                    than similar private enterprises would pay in taxes. Yet both
                                    companies have been operating at a loss of running ever further
                                    into debt. Thus very important and legitimate sources of revenue
                                    have been wasted. I am glad to learn from you that steps
                                    recently have been taken to put the Sugar Corporation on a sound
                                    financial basis; I hope that this will provide for a substantial
                                    and legitimate return to the Government. It is essential that
                                    the Power Company be placed on a similar foundation; otherwise I
                                    do not feel that the United States is warranted in making
                                    further capital investments in this Company, which already has
                                    absorbed some US$70 million in aid funds.</item>

                                    be expected to make a large profit, it could be permitted to
                                    make a modest return, which would eliminate the need for
                                    incurring further debt and would permit it to begin the
                                    liquidation of its large obligations.</item>

                                    dispersal plans, particularly for the Provincial Government,
                                    suggests the expenditure of extravagant sums for which no
                                    compensating revenue is in sight. I believe that this subject
                                    should be restudied with a view to reducing it to very modest
                                    proportions. Only a minimum of persons and facilities should be
                                    dispersed, and existing buildings, etc, at dispersal points
                                    should be used in most cases. There should be no serious thought
                                    of moving schools, etc.</item>

                                    that the national budget is within 3 percent of balance. I fear,
                                    however, that this figure has been reached after assuming a
                                    substantial United States contribution <pb n="169"
                                        xml:id="pg_169" facs="0197"/>in counterpart funds to budget
                                    balancing, and that it also is dependent on contributions by
                                    such agencies as those mentioned above (numbered paragraphs 2
                                    and 3) out of non-existent earnings. And, of course, the 3
                                    percent deficit takes no account of direct United States
                                    military and economic aid, which at present represents at least
                                    two-thirds of the total cost of maintaining the various branches
                                    of the Government of the Republic of China. All of this is well
                                    known to you, but I mention it because I fear that the use of a
                                    figure such as 3 percent to measure your budgetary deficit is
                                    misleading to most people. Even after our current program of
                                    reequipping your Armed Forces has been completed (say, in 1958),
                                    your current resources promise to cover scarcely half of your
                                    prospective requirements in local currency revenues and foreign
                                    exchange. This situation emphasizes the importance of early and
                                    effective attention to increasing revenues, putting Government
                                    enterprises on a sound basis and restricting expenditures and
                                    imports to genuine, practical needs.</item>

                                <item><hi rend="italic">Unforeseen Government Expenditure and
                                        Borrowing</hi>. In a situation such as exists at present it
                                    is inevitable that expenditures to meet emergency needs cannot
                                    always be foreseen when an annual budget is prepared. However, a
                                    budget becomes almost meaningless unless such unforeseen
                                    expenditures are covered immediately by (1) increased current
                                    revenues, (2) United States aid, or (3) postponing equivalent
                                    outlays already provided for but which events have shown should
                                    be given a lower priority. Government borrowing to meet
                                    emergency needs, under existing conditions, is in most cases
                                    equivalent to direct monetary inflation. I am hopeful,
                                    therefore, that in the future we can avoid all unforeseen
                                    outlays and new borrowing until each case has been fully
                                    discussed and agreement reached between the appropriate Chinese
                                    and American officials. Unless this can be done, not only your
                                    budgetary controls but also our counterpart program might almost
                                    as well be forgotten entirely. The assurance given in numbered
                                    paragraph 3 of your letter is therefore particularly encouraging
                                    to me.</item>

                                that in view of this, “the Chinese Government is therefore

                            asking for reaffirmation our agreement on privacy talks, requested
                            clarification statement his letter they considering issuing public
                            statement, and notified him that if they did so I reserved my right

                            on this subject with charges and counter-charges during which I referred
                            to leaks by NCNA correspondent as source many press stories. Believe net

                            he is going to issue any statement, but some indication decision is not

                            particularly as to their unwillingness ever to recognize “US
                            encroachment in Taiwan”, status quo, or that Taiwan was not domestic
                            matter. Somewhat more emphasis upon withdrawal of US forces from Taiwan
                            area.</p>
                        <p>3. I then made short statement on implementation to effect by no stretch
                            of imagination or interpretation can their performance be considered
                            expeditious, and that this situation closely related to other <pb

                        <p>4. I then made statement introducing our draft agreed announcement on
                            renunciation of force, giving him copy. Meeting adjourned after few
                            “preliminary comments” by him along expected lines.</p>
                        <p>5. He made no statement on trade embargo except for passing reference in
                            his opening general statement to effect unacceptable that discussion of
                            trade be conditioned upon issuance renunciation of force statement.</p>

                                China.</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said he would like to
                            discuss the embargo on trade with the Chinese People’s Republic. It was
                            not at all clear what grounds remained for retaining this embargo, and
                            he wondered if it were not time to settle this matter.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> knew we were having talks at ambassadorial level
                            here in Geneva with representatives of the Chinese People’s Republic.
                            This item had been suggested for the agenda and the U.S. had agreed, but
                            up to the present the Chinese representative had not pressed the
                            matter—perhaps, he thought, because <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172"
                                facs="0200"/>on the one hand we were awaiting the prompt fulfillment
                            by the Chinese Communists of their assurances that U.S. citizens in
                            China would have the expeditious right to return home; and possibly on
                            the other hand because they were discussing at present the mutual
                            renunciation of force in the Taiwan area. We had pointed out that our
                            attitude on trade would inevitably be affected by the Chinese
                            Communists’ attitude on the mutual renunciation of force. In any event,
                            it was an item on the agenda and would be discussed if the Chinese
                            representative so desired.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said he wished to
                            express his hope that the removal of the embargo would not be held up.
                            The removal of the embargo would have a very favorable effect on the
                            relaxation of tension in the Far East and would promote the development
                            of economic relations between countries in that area. The Secretary said
                            he was glad to take note of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName>’s observations.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. The Tanker Tuapse.</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said he would like to
                            raise the question of the Soviet tanker <hi rend="italic">Tuapse</hi>
                            and its crew which had been forcibly detained on Taiwan. He said twenty
                            of the crew had not been released, and since the U.S. had certain
                            responsibilities in that part of the world and maintained naval patrols
                            in that area, he felt that the U.S. was in a position to do something
                            about this.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> knew, the U.S. had used its good offices, as a
                            result of which all members of the crew who wished to return to the
                            Soviet Union had now done so. He said we could not, of course, by force
                            compel anyone to return, nor could we use our good offices to that end,
                            since it would be contrary to our principles. Insofar as the tanker was
                            concerned, he could not remember exactly, but he believed we had also
                            used our good offices, but up to the present without result.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said he would like to
                            state the following: For over a year, all forty-nine members of the crew
                            had been held in Taiwan, allegedly on the grounds that none of them
                            wished to return. But, by the great efforts they themselves had made,
                            twenty-nine had finally been permitted to return home. He said they had
                            grounds to believe that the other twenty would like to return also but
                            were being forcibly detained. He also wished to draw the attention of
                            the U.S. Government to the illegal detention of the Soviet tanker, in an
                            area which was under the protection of the U.S. Fleet.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that on his last visit he had urged President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> to release all
                            members of the crew who wished to return home. He felt that as a result
                            of this plea the men who desired to return had done so, and he did not
                            believe the remaining twenty were being held in any way against their
                            will. He said, however, that <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0201"/>on
                            his return to Washington he would be glad to look into the matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said he wished to
                            thank the Secretary for his statement.</p>

                                        only if Indians given same right in US. (b) Question of

                        <p>1192. 1. Two hour meeting this morning devoted entirely to draft Agreed
                            Announcement on renunciation of force except for statement by me on
                            implementation to which he did not reply. Discussion centered almost
                            entirely around our draft.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> opened meeting with long
                            and uncompromising prepared statement rejecting our draft as “totally
                            unjustifiable and absolutely unacceptable” and demanding acceptance his

                                        corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> elaborated on this
                                    point and commented in telegram 1203 from Geneva, November 18,
                                    as follows:</p>
                                <p>“While they have dropped immediate demand for withdrawal US
                                    forces from Taiwan they are of course trying to maneuver US into
                                    position of issuing statement which would provide strong basis
                                    for demanding our withdrawal. At same time they have interpreted
                                    reference to ’individual and collective self-defense’ in
                                    juxtaposition to Taiwan area in operative para our draft as
                                    requiring recognition by them, on one hand, of US right
                                    unilaterally to defend Taiwan, and, on other hand, validity of
                                    US defense treaty with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. From
                                    this it would follow that they are precluded from even raising
                                    question ‘withdrawal US forces from Taiwan’ as well as
                                    abandoning their over-all position of <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                        >GRC</gloss> and Taiwan. Therefore, it is empty to speak of
                                    not prejudicing their policies. Stripped of polemics believe
                                    this is genuine position they were setting forth in paras 8 and
                                    11 <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s statement (mytel
                                    1200) and that from their standpoint it has considerable point.”

                        <p>3. I replied with long extemporaneous statement rejecting his implication
                            US not seeking peaceful settlement by referring US proposal these talks,
                            statement on renunciation of force, and willingness discuss other
                            matters. I restated our position with respect <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss>, defense treaty, etc. Principal point was not now
                            attempt reconcile these differences but assure will not lead to war. I
                            then went through our draft paragraph by paragraph, asking him
                            specifically tell me with what they did not agree.</p>
                        <p>4. His reply and subsequent give and take was very noticeably milder than
                            prepared statement but did not add anything substantive.</p>
                        <p>5. I persisted in attempt obtain more concrete expression specific
                            objections our draft which he avoided by referring his opening statement
                            which I characterized as generalized and not helpful in arriving at
                            agreement on text. I pointed out our draft seemed to meet his three
                            principal requirements: a) no violation sovereignty, territorial
                            integrity, b) based on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> principles, and
                            c) concrete arrangements for peaceful settlement already provided for by
                            these talks. In reply he continued refer back to his prepared
                            statement.</p>
                        <p>6. Meeting closed on this inconclusive note. Next meeting Wednesday,

                                <p>“Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                                <p>My government views with concern the recent development in the
                                    Geneva talks on repatriation, especially the reported readiness
                                    of <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0204"/>the United States to
                                    issue an <hi rend="italic">agreed</hi> declaration to renounce
                                    the use of force generally and specifically in the Taiwan area
                                    as a parallel action to that to be taken by the Chinese
                                    Communists.</p>
                                <p>We have every reason to believe such a declaration, even though
                                    made unilaterally by the two parties, will inevitably be
                                    construed by the Communists and looked upon by the people on the
                                    mainland of China as well as the free world in general as a
                                    further step toward the United States recognition of the Chinese
                                    Communist regime. It would serve to enhance the Peiping regime’s
                                    prestige both internally and externally to the detriment of the
                                    international position of the Republic of China. It might
                                    further impair the morale of the people of free China both in
                                    Taiwan and abroad and particularly of her fighting forces, which
                                    has already been unfavorably affected since the outset of the
                                    Geneva talks.</p>
                                <p>The explicit renunciation of the use of force by the United
                                    States in the Taiwan area would seem to imply that the United
                                    States has been using force aggressively in that area and would
                                    also tend to confirm the often repeated Communist charges that
                                    the United States had committed aggression in Taiwan. It would
                                    in effect be tantamount to an admission on the part of the
                                    United States to equal responsibility for the existing situation
                                    in the Taiwan Strait, for which the Chinese Communists should
                                    and must be held solely responsible.</p>
                                <p>It may be recalled that <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                        En-lai</persName>, in his speech before the so called
                                    Peoples Congress in Peiping on July 30, 1955, dwelt at length on
                                    the “liberation” of Taiwan by “peaceful means” [as] an
                                    alternative to “war” or use of force. It is apparent that the
                                    Chinese Communists have for months been anticipating the
                                    occasion to propose a political settlement on Taiwan with the
                                    United States. It is our estimate that the Chinese Communist
                                    representative in Geneva will, by agreeing to the United States
                                    proposal for renouncing the use of force, seek to open
                                    negotiations for a political settlement on Taiwan.</p>
                                <p>In view of the above circumstances, the Chinese Government
                                    earnestly hopes that the United States Government can see its
                                    way to refrain from entering into the arrangement of an agreed
                                    declaration mentioned above and to reject any proposal to
                                    negotiate for a political settlement on Taiwan which may be
                                    brought up by the Chinese Communists. Any discussion on such a
                                    proposal will seriously involve the rights, claims and essential
                                    interests of the Republic of China.”</p></quote></p>

                                        to make charges and countercharges concerning policies of
                                        our governments. We both recognized grave and serious
                                        differences in our policies. However, I believed we agree on
                                        several things. We both determined differences shall not
                                        lead to war. Also agreed public statement should be made in
                                        this regard. I thought we agreed also that area in which
                                        policies are in particularly serious conflict is Taiwan
                                        area. Each of our drafts mentions Taiwan area. Also agreed
                                        whatever we say should not prejudice peaceful pursuit our
                                        policies.</p>
                                    <p>“40. I said that with such an area of agreement, there seemed
                                        to be sufficient room to discuss exactly how we were going
                                        to phrase our statement. I had taken his draft and

                                    <p>“We have a feeling that we may be getting into a fairly tight
                                        corner on the renunciation of force item although basically
                                        our position is unquestionably sound. It seems to us in
                                            <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> that we are suffering
                                        from our inability to state our precise position fully and
                                        frankly to key friendly governments; from the need to pull
                                        our verbal punches to some extent at Geneva in order to
                                        insure the continuation of the talks; from the increasingly
                                        serious misgivings of the Chinese Government (see Taipei’s
                                        463 of Nov. 17 transmitting the note of Foreign Minister

                                        Secretary); from the clever way in which the Chinese
                                        Communists are attempting to seize the initiative on the
                                        renunciation of force item and masquerade as the real
                                        sponsors of the renunciation of force concept. We are
                                        getting an increasing number of queries as to where we
                                        expect to go if the Chinese Communists should unexpectedly
                                        agree to sign some form of textually acceptable renunciation
                                        of force declaration? Taipei clearly believes that the
                                        Communists might be willing to sign some such form of
                                        declaration with no intention of observing it longer than it
                                        served their purposes. Taipei knows that no such declaration
                                        can be self-enforcing and they believe the Chinese
                                        Communists would not hesitate to try to rationalize a
                                        violation of any wording which might be proposed. Taipei is
                                        asking with increasing insistence, ’Where would you go after
                                        you got an agreed announcement on renunciation of force?’”

                            and increasing. The foreign exchange position was much better than a
                            year ago. However, we were experiencing inflation, due chiefly to the
                            Chinese Government’s excess of expenditures over revenues. There were
                            other factors contributing to the recent rise in commodities, but these
                            were largely seasonal or accidental, and correspondingly less
                            significant. Some of the price inflation was a direct result of
                            prosperity, particularly in the field of building construction where
                            shortages of cement, brick, steel and skilled labor had contributed to a
                            substantial increase in costs even when measured in United States
                            dollars.</p>
                        <p>One remedy, it seemed to me, might be found in a more definite fixing of
                            financial responsibility as between various Chinese agencies, and also
                            between Chinese and Americans connected with our joint efforts. Although
                            the military program was much larger than <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180"
                                facs="0208"/>the economic, it was also simpler in many ways and
                            easier to understand. On the economic side we had to deal with many
                            factors, including intangibles, and responsibility had become too
                            diffused. Under such circumstances, if something went wrong it was only
                            natural for the Chinese to blame the Americans, while the Americans
                            blamed the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>I ventured to cite two examples of diffused responsibility involving both
                            military and economic factors and to propose, very tentatively, a
                            remedy. The Chinese Government was now purchasing large quantities of
                            crude oil abroad and the substantially increased requirements in
                            prospect for the coming year were causing great anxiety on financial
                            grounds. Much of this increase would be for military needs and the
                            Chinese Petroleum Company would expect reimbursement from <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> counterpart funds (local currency), but
                            the drain on foreign exchange would be serious. At the same time, the
                            Chinese Government was paying for most of the food requirements of its
                            armed forces. To a large extent this was accomplished by obtaining rice
                            below cost from the Food Bureau, which was then forced to borrow from
                            the bank and was running ever further into debt. Meanwhile the United
                            States was also supplying petroleum products and certain items of food,
                            such as soya beans, for the armed forces. This diffusion of
                            responsibility produced confusion, uncertainty, financial
                            irresponsibility and waste.</p>
                        <p>Whether it would be practicable I was not sure, but it seemed to me
                            logical economically and preferable psychologically that China should
                            assume full responsibility for the feeding of its armed forces (along
                            with such items as their pay, clothing and administration), while
                            procurement of petroleum from abroad, involving as it did large amounts
                            of foreign exchange, seemed more properly an American responsibility
                            under present conditions. I repeated that this was only a tentative
                            proposal, put forward for purposes of illustration, but that I was
                            persuaded of the importance of more definite fixing of responsibility. I
                            felt that the United States should concentrate on a smaller number of
                            major projects in Free China; this did not imply any reduction in total
                            aid.</p>
                        <p>The President again expressed the desire that the Americans here should
                            help his government to straighten out its current economic difficulties
                            and put the economy on a better basis.</p>
                        <p>Reference was made to <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral
                                Stump</persName>’s present visit and I expressed the hope that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> would find
                            occasion to discuss the defense of the offshore islands and the question
                            of command relationships with the <persName>Admiral</persName>. I said
                            that I usually tried to keep out of purely military matters, but that I
                            was disturbed by apparent serious differences of opinion between some
                            Chinese and American officers, and between certain Americans for that
                            matter, as <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0209"/>to the best methods
                            of defending Kinmen and Matsu. I was not aware of any significant
                            differences of opinion between <persName corresp="#p_PVAAM1">Admiral

                            all of the Americans on the islands were under <persName
                                corresp="#p_SMGGW1">Smythe</persName> and …, who in turn were not
                            under <persName corresp="#p_PVAAM1">Pride</persName> although the latter
                            was our responsible operations head in this area. Only <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> had general authority, I
                            said, and his visit provided an opportunity to iron out any important
                            differences that might exist. I referred specifically to the central
                            fortress now being constructed on Kinmen, which some thought a good idea
                            and others regarded as a serious mistake.<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2"

                        <p>1212. 1. Two hour and fifty minute meeting this morning. No progress
                            whatever.</p>
                        <p>2. Towards end of meeting <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>
                            pressed me very hard with some obvious but unknown purpose in mind to
                            commit myself to discussion his draft at next meeting while flatly and
                            categorically rejecting our draft as any basis for further discussion.
                            Although purpose unknown I was quite clear that he had some specific
                            move in mind if I had given flat negative reply. I of course avoided any
                            commitment, repeatedly replying in response to his demands for flat yes
                            or no that I had been and would continue striving for agreement on a
                            text while expressing disappointment lack his concrete responses to
                            specific questions concerning wording to which they objected in our

                            point I made was that these talks were normal and natural way discussing
                            and settling differences. I said that if his government is as desirous
                            of peaceful settlement disputes as my government, it will enable him
                            make full and honest efforts negotiate and discuss differences here
                            before raising question terminating these talks and substituting another
                            method of negotiation. “When we have succeeded in resolving questions we
                            are called upon to deal with here, then our governments will naturally
                            be in better position consider what further steps might be taken[”].</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> replied with long prepared
                            statement repeating former arguments rejecting our draft, adding nothing
                            new. However he included statement with respect to trade embargo
                            rejecting “US proposal for lifting trade embargo in exchange for <gloss

                                            ><hi rend="italic">infra</hi></ref>, he described his
                                    reply to this point as follows:</p>
                                <p>“I replied <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> had
                                    misunderstood our position on question of embargo. In inviting
                                    his views, I had pointed out fact that measures he termed
                                    embargo taken by US in light of security interests. Measures US
                                    takes in regard to trade must take into consideration what we
                                    consider to be security interests. If US considers that danger
                                    of hostilities is lessened or removed, this naturally influences
                                    US point of view on trade. However, I certainly did not mean to
                                    imply that US willing trade lifting embargo for statement on
                                    renunciation of force.”</p></note></p>
                        <p>6. In my reply and during much give and take I attempted keep discussion
                            focussed upon concrete discussion our draft but he avoided all
                            discussion our draft beyond that contained his original prepared
                            statement and insisted on coming back his draft.</p>

                            implementation as follows:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows the text of the statement.]</p>
                        <p>2. I continued with prepared statement on renunciation of force as
                            follows: <list>
                                <label>a.</label>
                                <item>I have since our last meeting carefully reviewed our
                                    discussion thus far with respect renunciation of force. I have
                                    particularly reviewed statements which you have made in this
                                    regard including your statement at our last meeting.</item>
                                <label>b.</label>
                                <item>In doing this I have been seeking to find basis upon which it
                                    would be possible make progress in our search for agreement on
                                    text for public statement. I am encouraged by progress we have
                                    thus far made with respect to principles, but our difficulties
                                    now seem revolve in large part around words with which express
                                    those principles. I have tried, and will continue try, make my
                                    best constructive efforts toward this end and I hope you will
                                    also do so. I am satisfied that, if we both do this, our
                                    agreement in principle is wide enough permit us reach agreement
                                    on words.</item>
                                <label>c.</label>
                                <item>Mr. Ambassador, I am sorry have to say that I do not feel that
                                    your statement at our last meeting constituted such constructive
                                    effort. As I said at time, it was confined to generalizations,
                                    most of which were of very controversial character and of little
                                    pertinence our immediate task. I have tried at previous meetings
                                    explain why I felt your draft of October 27 did not best meet
                                    situation. I also made effort in my draft of November 10 meet
                                    both points of view. In spite of these efforts you simply
                                    rejected my draft and demanded that I accept your draft. It is
                                    hard for me to reconcile this with genuine desire make
                                    progress.</item>
                                <label>d.</label>
                                <item>In your statement at our last meeting you entirely ignored
                                    statement made in my November 10 draft clearly setting forth
                                    that announcement was without prejudice to pursuit by each side
                                    of its policies by peaceful means. You entirely ignored clear
                                    wording of draft and alleged that it constituted requirement on
                                    your government renounce its views and policies. I want make it
                                    absolutely clear that draft constitutes no such requirement with
                                    respect to views and peaceful policies of your government. Draft
                                    provides that your government will simply state it will not
                                    initiate use of armed force to implement those policies. US
                                    Government at same time will renew its often repeated statements
                                    in this regard. I cannot see how any reasonable person can
                                    possibly misinterpret this proposal on part of my government and
                                    say that it calls into question desire of my government seek
                                    just and peaceful settlements of disputes between US, including
                                    those in Taiwan area and therefore I do not believe arguments
                                        <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0212"/>which you gave as
                                    alleged basis for rejecting my November 10 draft have a basis in
                                    fact.</item>
                                <label>e.</label>
                                <item>At our last meeting you also again spoke of meeting of our
                                    foreign ministers, as if that was only means of peacefully
                                    settling disputes. You appear continue confuse basic difference
                                    between fundamental principle of unconditionally agreeing
                                    peacefully settle disputes and procedural question of what form
                                    of negotiation shall be used implement that principle. My
                                    government proposed these talks as normal and natural way of
                                    discussing and settling our differences. We are both ambassadors
                                    fully authorized speak for our respective governments to extent
                                    that our governments are willing enable us do so. That is why my
                                    government proposed that these talks be at Ambassadorial level.
                                    If your government is as desirous of peaceful settlement of
                                    disputes between us as is my government, it will enable you to
                                    make full and honest efforts negotiate and discuss our
                                    differences here before raising question of terminating these
                                    talks and substituting another method of negotiation. When we
                                    have succeeded in resolving questions which we are called upon
                                    deal with here, then our governments will naturally be in better
                                    position consider what further steps might be taken.</item>
                                <label>[f.]</label>
                                <item>At our last meeting you also particularly spoke of inclusion
                                    in my draft of phrase concerning right of individual and
                                    collective self-defense. I am very surprised at your apparent
                                    rejection of inclusion of such phrase as I would have thought
                                    that you would have considered it very important. Your
                                    interpretation of phrase was very distorted and, read in context
                                    of my draft declaration as whole, I do not consider that your
                                    interpretation is correct. What phrase simply says is, while we
                                    will not initiate hostilities, each of us wish to make clear
                                    that, if there is an attack in Taiwan area or elsewhere, we will
                                    defend ourselves individually or in concert with others. You
                                    have spoken much of principles of United Nations Charter. This
                                    principle of right of self-defense is certainly age old, natural
                                    principle which is again restated in United Nations Charter, and
                                    it is difficult for me see on what basis there can be objection
                                    thereto.</item>
                                <label>g.</label>
                                <item>We have both agreed that our differences of view and disputes
                                    between us should not lend [<hi rend="italic">lead</hi>?] to
                                    war, and that it is intent of both of us that we will not permit
                                    this happen. Thus draft I have proposed simply says this in as
                                    straightforward and simple language as I am able
                                    contrive.</item>
                                <label>h.</label>
                                <item>We both agree that region in which our differing policies and
                                    views confront each other most seriously is in area of Taiwan.
                                    This is also obvious to world. Therefore, in making such general
                                    statement it is important to make clear to world that neither of
                                    us has any hidden reservations or qualifications concerning
                                    applicability of that general principle to area of Taiwan. My
                                    draft thus proposes that we specifically and clearly state this
                                    as fact.</item>
                                <label>i.</label>
                                <item>We also are agreed that in whatever we say neither of us wants
                                    sacrifice or prejudice our position with respect to matters at
                                    issue between ourselves or others, that is, we do not desire to
                                    say something that would prevent us from maintaining our views
                                    and pursuing our policies by means other than use of military
                                    force. We want to be free pursue our policies by peaceful means.
                                    My draft also says this in just as clear and simple terms as I
                                    can.</item>

                                <item>We are also agreed on principle that peaceful means should be
                                    used for just settlement of disputes between us. It was in
                                    accordance with this principle United States proposed these
                                    talks and it was hoped that reason your government accepted this
                                    proposal was that it also agrees with this principle. United
                                    States has done everything possible and will continue do all it
                                    can make these talks succeed. My government’s purpose in
                                    suggesting declaration renouncing use of force as a fundamental
                                    first principle was intended contribute this objective, and it
                                    will continue be our policy, based on principles of United
                                    Nations Charter, strive for just settlement of disputes by
                                    peaceful means.</item>

                                    reaction” in Taiwan; it read in part as follows:</p>

                                    acquiescence in status quo of satellites including Red China
                                    touches most sensitive spot.</p>

                                    aggression. However its commitment to use force only after joint
                                    agreement with US was undertaking on assumption of continuing
                                    American policy looking toward eventual liberation of Red
                                    satellites. Joint US-Peiping agreement to renounce force, no
                                    matter how worded, almost inevitable would be regarded here as
                                    reversal of American policy and as implying assumption by US of

                        <p>Chinese Communists are undoubtedly capable of following military course
                            of action outlined and US must be prepared cope with them if they do so.
                            One essential step this direction is construction Kung Kuan airfield,
                            and Department is pressing for early allocation funds for this purpose.
                            However, in present world situation, any step-up in Red military
                            activities in Taiwan area has disadvantages for them as well as
                            advantages and our policy should be aimed at maximizing both political

                                <item>In this situation, Geneva talks are serving several useful
                                    purposes, (a) They have made it more difficult for Chinese
                                    Communists to take military action against off-shore islands and
                                    Taiwan. More we are able to rally world support for renunciation
                                    of force in Taiwan area, more it will cost Chinese Communists in
                                    terms of setbacks in achieving their other objectives if they
                                    should take up the sword, (b) They have denied Communists
                                    opportunity to plausibly represent US as stubbornly refusing
                                    settle disputes through negotiation. Had we not taken initiative
                                    to begin these talks under conditions of our own choosing, we
                                    could have been confronted with unhappy choice of either
                                    accepting Chinese Communist proposal to negotiate under far less
                                    favorable conditions (e.g., Far Eastern conference) or turning
                                    down such a proposal and risking increasing isolation from our
                                    allies and influential neutrals. In latter event, it would
                                    become even more difficult for us to rally necessary support for

                        <p>In demanding renunciation of recourse to force in Taiwan area, we are
                            endeavoring to place Chinese Communists in position where either
                            acceptance or rejection by them of no force principle would help to
                            solidify world opinion against any subsequent warlike move on their

                        <p>Department is concerned at your assessment that any US-Peiping
                            renunciation of force “no matter how worded” would be regarded by <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> as sell-out, leading to precipitous
                            morale drop “with likelihood of Red take-over in year or so through
                            demoralization and defection.” <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has
                            been aware for some time that US is unwilling to support return to
                            mainland by force of arms. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> must also
                            realize that disparity in population territory and resources weights
                            scales heavily against <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in any
                            military contest with Chinese Communists. Consequently, it is in their
                            interest as well as ours to use all political means at our disposal to
                            block, if possible, further development of such a military contest.</p>
                        <p>Chinese Communists have so far shown no inclination to accept a
                            renunciation of force applicable to the Taiwan area. Should they do so,
                            this would of course have no effect upon the continuing US determination
                            to fulfill its treaty commitments to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss>. The US does not intend to trade performance for a
                            Chinese Communist promise and it will consequently be necessary to
                            maintain adequate strength in the area to counter the Communist threat,
                            whether or not they publicly renounce force.</p>

                            It is therefore gratifying to receive further confirmation of

                                            affairs—that is, question of China’s exercise of
                                            sovereign rights in liberty of Taiwan. This falls within

                            which concerns only the Communists and the Nationalists and in which he
                            retains complete freedom to use force in that area. The second part he
                            defines as an international question involving issues between the
                            Communists and United States. As to this the Communists are willing to
                            renounce the use of force. By this formulation, the Communists seek <pb
                                n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0219"/>to deprive the United States of
                            its right to use force in collective self defense, an inherent right
                            recognized by the Charter, while preserving to the Communists entire
                            freedom to use force to take Taiwan any time they wish. This Communist
                            tactic appears designed to handcuff the United States by pious
                            expressions of the renunciation of force to settle disputes while
                            reserving to itself complete freedom to use force to take Taiwan
                            whenever it wishes. This entirely defeats object of seeking declaration
                            on renunciation of force in the Taiwan area which was designed not as a
                            verbal exercise but to remove in fact threat of armed conflict there and
                            thus permit progress in discussion on other practical issues.</p>

                            can be fruitful discussions other issues.</p>

                                Ambassadorial Talks at Geneva</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The following background information on the United States-Chinese
                            Communist Ambassadorial talks at Geneva should be used as appropriate on
                            a confidential basis in conversations with key officials of the
                            government to which you are accredited and diplomatic colleagues. The
                            Department particularly desires to scotch speculation that the talks
                            presage recognition of the Chinese Communist regime by the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The original agreement was that the talks would deal first with the
                            return of civilians to their respective countries, then go on to “other
                            practical matters at issue”. On September 10 the two Ambassadors issued
                            an Agreed Announcement in which the Chinese Communists declared that
                            Americans in the Peoples Republic of China <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192"
                                facs="0220"/>who desired to return to the United States were
                            entitled to do so and pledged itself to adopt “further appropriate
                            measures” so that they could “expeditiously exercise their right to
                            return”. The Agreed Announcement also provided that Americans in the
                            Peoples Republic of China who believed they were encountering
                            obstruction in departure might request representations by the British
                            Chargé d’affaires on their behalf. The United States made a parallel
                            declaration with respect to the right of Chinese in the United States to
                            return to the Peoples Republic of China if they desired which provided
                            for Chinese to appeal to the Indian Embassy if they believed their
                            departure was being obstructed.</p>
                        <p>Of the nineteen Americans still held in prison in Communist China
                            following the issuance of the Agreed Announcement, only five have been
                            released to date. The United States is continuing to press at Geneva and
                            through the British Chargé d’affaires at Peiping for early release of
                            the remainder. The failure of the Chinese Communists to fulfill their
                            commitment to allow Americans to return “expeditiously” is causing the
                            United States Government serious concern.</p>
                        <p>The United States places no restrictions on the departure of Chinese from
                            the United States. The Department knows of no Chinese who claims his
                            departure is being obstructed and the Indian Embassy has so far made no
                            representations concerning any such case.</p>
                        <p>Under the second item of the agenda, the Chinese Communists asked for the
                            removal of the United States economic embargo and agreement to talks at
                            the Foreign Minister level. The United States asked for a Chinese
                            Communist declaration renouncing force, and an accounting for 450
                            military personnel missing from the Korean War, and concerning whose
                            fate we have evidence that the Chinese Communists might have
                            knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Discussion has centered around the renunciation of force item. The United
                            States has proposed that both parties make similar declarations
                            renouncing the use of force generally, and with particular reference to
                            the Taiwan area. The purpose is to remove the threat of war in the
                            Taiwan area. The Chinese Communists have indicated a willingness to make
                            a general renunciation of the use of force, but so far have adamantly
                            resisted our efforts to get them to apply this to the Taiwan area. They
                            insist that the Taiwan question is domestic and refuse to consider any
                            curtailment of their freedom to use military force if necessary to
                            impose their control over Taiwan. They have demanded the withdrawal of
                            United States forces from the Taiwan area. The United States is
                            continuing its effort to bring them to modify this attitude.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the proposal for a conference at a higher level, the
                            United States view is that the ambassadorial level is the appropriate
                            one. No proposal for higher level talks could even be considered <pb
                                n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0221"/>until the Chinese Communists
                            have permitted all United States citizens to leave, have renounced force
                            in the Taiwan area, and all other practical matters at issue have been
                            disposed of.</p>
                        <p>The questions of economic embargo and missing military personnel have
                            received little discussion up to the present.</p>
                        <p>The United States has assured the Government of the Republic of China
                            that it will not discuss at Geneva anything involving the rights, claims
                            and essential interests of the Government of the Republic of China.
                            There has been no discussion of recognition or admission of Communist
                            China to the United Nations, as rumored in the press. Discussion has
                            been strictly limited to subjects mentioned in the preceding

                            his stand in talks following issuance announcement. Draft announcement
                            embraced all points on which both sides agree and contained nothing
                            disagreeable to either side. He believed we should be able reach

                        <p>6. I replied I welcomed <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s
                            statement and felt it represented considerable advance our discussions.
                            I would give draft the detailed and careful consideration I knew it
                            deserved.</p>
                        <p>7. I said I had one question. Major point of difference between us so far
                            has been whether or not there should be specific mention Taiwan area. I
                            wanted make clear our suggestions in regard specific mention Taiwan area
                            not motivated desire embarrass or trick <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName>’s Government into abandoning its well known
                            position in regard Taiwan area. Desire for specific mention Taiwan area
                            motivated by desire make clear whatever is said on renunciation of force
                            applies also to Taiwan area.</p>
                        <p>8. I said on basis original draft and <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName>’s remarks in course of meetings, there has been
                            doubt in my mind in this regard. I originally raised this question when
                            October 27 draft presented. I asked at that time whether fourth
                            paragraph applicable disputes between us in Taiwan area. I recalled
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s answer had been yes.
                            However, in subsequently amplifying his position, it seemed to me his
                            government was reserving right to consider situation Taiwan area as
                            domestic matter beyond scope of international matters between our two
                            countries. I understood his position in this regard and did not desire
                            engage in controversy this point. I simply desired know what effect
                            draft announcement would have our dispute in Taiwan area. As I
                            understood his remarks, effect is that his government reserved right at
                            any time interpret situation as domestic matter in which it entitled
                            take offensive military action.</p>
                        <p>9. I said stated in another way his proposal appeared to me to have been
                            that although we would seem to have agreed renounce force between us,
                            his government would maintain threat at any time of its choosing to
                            initiate hostilities that area. We consider it important that whatever
                            is said on renunciation of force, it be made clear that even though
                            there may be differences in interpretation of situation in Taiwan area,
                            announcement also apply that area.</p>
                        <p>10. I said this was somewhat long introduction my question, but I wanted
                            make clear our line of thinking. Questions whether or not <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> willing consider mention in some
                            specific way of Taiwan area in order make clear we both consider
                            announcement applies Taiwan area. Said I might add I perfectly willing
                            this be done in manner not <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0224"/>to
                            prejudice his government’s position and pursuit by peaceful means of its
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said we had already spent
                            long period of time discussing this question. Purpose discussions was
                            overcome obstacles in way of settlement between us. Proposal for both of
                            us make announcement originated with myself. Now we have before us two
                            drafts for announcement. Each of us has points which he cannot accept in
                            draft of other one.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said however at last
                            meeting I had indicated we agreed on principle making announcement and
                            also agreed on need for peaceful settlement disputes but differed on
                            text of agreement. At last meeting I had also repeatedly indicated that
                            so long as we agreed in principle, there should be no difficulty in
                            agreeing on text. So long as we both serious and sincere in search of
                            agreement, there should be no difficulty.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said his side had now made
                            new effort in that spirit. I would note that new proposal did not
                            contain anything to which we not able agree between us at present time.
                            He considered that issues between <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                            and US must necessarily be solved step by step. His idea was first to
                            agree on points in common between us. So long as we employed peaceful
                            means for settling disputes, he saw no reason for not reaching
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said in regard to mention
                            of Taiwan area, he wished to renew his statements made in past meetings.
                            We must not confuse international with domestic issues. Internal
                            conflict naturally not within scope of present talks. In explaining
                            fourth paragraph October 27 draft and also in presenting present draft,
                            he had made clear disputes between two countries include dispute between
                            us in Taiwan area. It was precisely desire of <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> side that disputes between us in Taiwan area be settled
                            peacefully.</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said he wished point out
                            that proposal made this morning was very important and put forward only
                            after serious and careful consideration. He was glad to hear my
                            preliminary views and comments this draft. He hoped our side would give
                            careful consideration to this latest offer. He hoped we would be able
                            reach agreement on this draft. Adoption this draft would demonstrate
                            that although we spent great deal of time in discussion, we able make
                            progress and find text agreeable both of us.</p>
                        <p>16. I said I was still trying to get at heart of matter. I too hoped we
                            can show progress to world. Important thing is we make sure it is
                            genuine progress. Our problem is not give appearance of progress by
                            agreeing to form of words that means one thing to one side and another
                            to other. Problems we face are too fundamental importance for that. I
                            felt we would be doing disservice to both our people and cause of peace
                            if we attempted agree on basis words which had different <pb n="197"
                                xml:id="pg_197" facs="0225"/>meanings. That is why I may be
                            appearing so persistent. Purpose is not debate but to try to arrive at
                            understanding. I agreed that problems should be discussed step-by-step.
                            We both agreed that area in which policies confront each other most
                            seriously is Taiwan area.</p>
                        <p>17. I said what I was trying to get at was this. In making statement such
                            as he had proposed, US would be renewing what I had termed renunciation
                            of force in international relations; <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName>’s government would give appearance of doing same
                            thing. However, in light of his remarks and fully expressed policy his
                            government, would not his government in fact be saying it considered
                            question of Taiwan area domestic matter and hence reserved right
                            initiate use of force any time it did?</p>
                        <p>18. I said perhaps I had not made myself clear. I would state my point in
                            another way. While his side was willing make declaration of renunciation
                            of force with US, did it still insist on right interpret situation
                            Taiwan area to permit it to apply force at any time its desires not met?
                            That is, would US have renounced force whereas <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s government would not have done so
                            because of its reservations in regard to nature of dispute in Taiwan
                            area? Would any further negotiation between us be subject to continuing
                            threat of initiation of force by his government that area?</p>
                        <p>19. I said I hoped I was not right in this. What I had expressed frankly
                            was my understanding of position <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName>’s government. I wished he would tell me frankly if
                            I was wrong.</p>
                        <p>20. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said he thought it
                            important to note we were dealing with matters between China and US. If
                            he were to raise matters or policies within scope internal affairs US or
                            if he were to cause apprehensions concerning US policy of internal
                            affairs, he would be guilty of going beyond scope present talks. This
                            would complicate problem between us and would amount to creating
                            difficulties in talks.</p>
                        <p>21. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said draft he had
                            presented can in no way be described as an “apparent” form. He agreed
                            anything we declared should have practical bearing. Difference of
                            policies our two countries in Taiwan area has lead to extremely tense
                            situation over which people of world most concerned. Demonstrating our
                            desire settle disputes by peaceful means without resort to use of force
                            meets with desire people of world. This action in interests both
                            sides.</p>
                        <p>22. I said I would put my question very bluntly, if this or similar
                            statement were issued tomorrow, would his government have said anything
                            that would prevent it on next day from saying that it considered
                            situation Taiwan area domestic matter and was therefore initiating
                            hostilities there?</p>
                        <p>23. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said my question went
                            precisely beyond scope of talks. As he had repeatedly stated, question
                            of Taiwan is an internal matter of China, which his side also willing
                            settle by peaceful means. <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0226"/>To
                            follow line I had taken, if we were to issue announcement tomorrow, then
                            our discussions have created same result. That is, two countries
                            henceforth willing settle any dispute by peaceful means. That would
                            certainly be welcomed by all. It would demonstrate to world that China
                            and US have made contribution to relaxing tension Taiwan area.</p>
                        <p>24. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said following issuance of
                            announcement, we would continue discussion to find settlement disputes,
                            such as question embargoes and higher level conference between two
                            countries. Then if I wanted discuss further ways and means relax tension
                            Taiwan area, his side prepared join me and continue discussion in this
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>[25.] I said would this mean discussions would not be held under threat
                            that one side would reserve right initiate hostilities if its desires
                            not fully met?</p>
                        <p>26. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said it has always been
                            stand his side that negotiations should be carried on in peaceful
                            atmosphere. If one were to mention threats, it is his side that felt
                            itself being threatened.</p>
                        <p>27. I said I had nothing further on this subject. I would study draft and
                            reply more fully at next meeting. Before passing to another matter, did
                            he have anything further?</p>
                        <p>28. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said we had talked a great
                            deal on this subject and new effort his side was being made on basis of
                            what I had said at last meeting. He believed draft is within interest of
                            both of us, and hoped we would progress smoothly on this subject.</p>
                        <p>29. I said I agreed, and felt our discussion this morning had been most
                            useful. I hoped he would meanwhile consider question I had raised this
                            morning. Amplification of his answers would be most helpful.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion concerning implementation of the agreed
                            announcement.]</p>

                        <p>1241. 1. Believe yesterday’s developments reflect major tactical shift in
                            Peiping which will require corresponding decisions on our part. Whatever
                            their motives their draft almost completely meets position I have been
                            taking.</p>
                        <p>2. Their acceptance renunciation force concept, and agreement to
                            apparently indefinite extension these talks probably stems in part from
                            Peiping estimate repercussions these developments on Taiwan as well as
                            on our allies. Postponement demand for FonMin conference probably
                            influenced by our firm rejection this proposal at present stage, by
                            failure obtain support of <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>
                            (as well as <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>) and realization their
                            public position of pistol-to-head demand on this issue was not good.
                            Believe Secretary’s communications to <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U
                                Nu</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">Reference is apparently
                                to the message transmitted in <ref target="#d70">Document
                                70</ref>.</note> substance of which undoubtedly passed on, also
                            played important part.</p>
                        <p>3. At any rate <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> has now presented
                            draft which very closely follows line of argument I have been taking in
                            meetings. They therefore have grounds for anticipating its acceptance
                            with little modification. If not accepted they are in very strong
                            negotiating as well as public position and will probably not hesitate
                            quickly to go to public if they consider it desirable bring pressure on
                            us.</p>
                        <p>4. One question is whether in context negotiations thus far there would
                            be commitment by U.S. to discuss in some form “relaxation and
                            elimination of tension in Taiwan area”. Refusal in any way to admit to
                            discussion these talks would be difficult to defend publicly and would
                            support their demand for FonMin meeting. Acceptance will increase
                            strains our relations with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> but
                            possibly to lesser extent than FonMin meeting. Possibly we can find some
                            subject we can introduce or some unilateral action we can take that
                            would give us at least temporary initiative in this general field.</p>
                        <p>5. Another question is what other subjects could be introduced or
                            discussed in effort keep talks going so as postpone coming to grips with
                            thorny Taiwan area questions. Trade is now only remaining question and
                            particularly if I must continue indicate complete firmness on U.S.
                            embargo this offers little scope for meetings. While lowering <gloss
                                target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> levels fairly promptly
                            following issuance any declaration renunciation force would be useful
                            move, it cannot provide much in way of subject for discussion in
                            meetings.</p>
                        <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0228"/>
                        <p>6. In light of above I will need as well as much background guidance as
                            it is now possible to give me on what we desire concerning future course
                            of talks.</p>
                        <p>7. With respect <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s draft
                            believe situation precludes my introduction new counter draft or return
                            my first draft. On other hand I should have clear idea whether we
                            willing accept his draft with or without such amendments we might
                            suggest. I need not necessarily give final approval at next meeting but
                            will desire avoid taking any positions from which I might later be
                            required to retreat.</p>
                        <p>8. With respect his draft it seems to me principal question is whether I
                            should press for specific mention of Taiwan. It seems to me from
                            standpoint our relations with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and
                            degree to which we are committed to discussion Taiwan area questions
                            with <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> there is much to be said for
                            omission any specific reference to Taiwan in declaration. This also
                            related to whether we are to regard any such declaration as primarily
                            legal or political statement. While statement as presently drafted may
                            contain legal loopholes with respect Taiwan area, regarded as political
                            statement it seems to me it would be extremely difficult for Peiping
                            issue this statement and then turn around and attempt justify attack in
                            Taiwan area on grounds unexpressed fine print. In eyes of world both
                            friendly and enemy, major dispute between U.S. and <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> is in Taiwan area.</p>
                        <p>9. With respect second para <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s
                            draft, important note re accurate and literal translation of Chinese
                            original would be <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and U.S. “are
                            determined that they should settle disputes between their two countries
                            through peaceful negotiations and also will not resort to any (and all)
                            threat (intimidation) of military force”. (Chinese text operative
                            portion this para and last para being transmitted by separate tel.)<note

                            course much stronger and preferable from our standpoint to English
                            translation given me by <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>,
                            there not being any conditional relationship between negotiations and
                            renunciation of force.</p>
                        <p>10. Therefore believe that, subject to whatever views Department may have
                            with respect to specific reference to Taiwan, I can and should at next
                            meeting probe on substitution of “and also” for “without” in English
                            text. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> will probably not
                            commit himself but question will inevitably arise as to whether we
                            prepared accept if they agree our English version.</p>

                            had not been feeling at all well. He was going to Columbia University
                            Hospital in New York for further diagnosis. He expected to have
                            treatments after that and would be in the U.S. until about mid-January.

                                <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> a brief résumé of the
                            course of the <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>–<persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> Ambassadorial talks at Geneva,
                            stressing that (1) no “deal” was being engineered; (2) no matters
                            involving the rights and interests of the Government of China would be
                            discussed; (3) no degree of diplomatic recognition of Communist China
                            was intended or implied; (4) U.S. opposition to admission of Communist
                            China to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> remained firm; (5) only
                            U.S. objectives in the talks were to obtain the release of U.S.
                            nationals and to obtain Chinese Communist commitment to the principle of
                            the renunciation of force, a principle to which the U.S. was already
                            committed and which it was always willing to reaffirm. He cited the
                            flagrant refusal of the Chinese Communists to carry out their commitment
                            under the Agreed Announcement on the return of civilians.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> also referred to
                            our concern that the international position of the Chinese Government
                            might be gravely prejudiced if the Chinese Government carried out its
                            apparent intention to block <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0230"/>the
                            18-nation membership proposal about to come before the UN Security
                                Council.<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">Reference is to a
                                widely-supported proposal to admit 18 nations to U.N. membership as
                                a “package”, an arrangement which was threatened by the ROC
                                Government’s declared intention of vetoing the admission of the
                                Mongolian People’s Republic. The concern expressed by <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> was conveyed in messages
                                from President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> to President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> as well in
                                conversations; documentation on this subject is scheduled for
                                publication in the U.N. membership compilation in a forthcoming
                                volume. When the proposal came before the Security Council on
                                December 13, the Republic of China vetoed the admission of Mongolia,
                                and the Soviet Union vetoed the remaining non-Communist countries on
                                the list. A compromise proposal to admit 16 countries, not including
                                Mongolia and Japan, was accepted the following day.</note> He
                            assured General <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> that the U.S.
                            was also opposed to the admission of the Communist satellites, but it
                            was unwilling to invoke the veto power to block the will of the majority
                            of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members on a membership
                            question.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> expressed appreciation
                            for what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> had told
                            him. His field was military rather than diplomatic. He wanted to give
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> the substance of a
                            briefing which he had given the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> on

                                        corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> with a covering
                                    letter of December 9 from Hedding which states that it contained
                                    the highlights of <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName>’s
                                    subsequent briefing of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It reads in
                                    part as follows:</p>
                                <p>“He [<persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName>] stated that he
                                    considered next year, 1956, to be a decisive one, that he needed
                                    this year for the training of the Chinese Armed Forces. Further,
                                    he felt that ’56 may well be a decisive one from the point of
                                    view of the possibility of Communist attack against off-shore
                                    islands, particularly Quemoy. He feels that the ten new fields
                                    which the Chinese Communists are building will be completed
                                    around the middle of next year, and at this time they should
                                    have the capability of launching an invasion of Quemoy.</p>
                                <p>“He felt that only by reducing or deterring the possibility of
                                    this invasion will it be possible to stabilize the situation in
                                    this area. He feels that it is a common objective to stabilize
                                    the situation, and particularly so for the Chinese Nationalists
                                    in order that they may have this time for training of their
                                    armed forces. He further feels that only by building up the
                                    defenses of Quemoy and making them strong will it be possible to
                                    deter an invasion by the Chinese Communists.” (Department of
                                    State, Central Files, 033.9311/12–955)</p></note> concerning the
                            development of Chinese Communist military capabilities in the
                            Foochow-Amoy-Swatow area. He said that as a graduate in logic from
                            Harvard, he consistently avoided, predictions about Chinese Communist
                            intentions, concerning which no one could be certain. However, much was
                            known about the increase in Chinese Communist military capabilities in
                            South China, and certain conclusions could reasonably be drawn from the
                            rapid growth of these capabilities.</p>
                        <p>He produced a series of aerial photographs of the City of Amoy and
                            various new airfields under construction in Fukien Province. He pointed
                            out indications of concentrated military preparations in the area just
                            behind the harbor in Amoy. He said that the new airfields going up are
                            not mere landing strips, but are designed as fully <pb n="203"
                                xml:id="pg_203" facs="0231"/>equipped operational fields capable of
                            handling jet bombers and fighters. He said that tremendous effort and
                            economic sacrifice were demanded for the construction of these new
                            military facilities in South China. The Chinese Communists were
                            foregoing the use of these resources in West China (Kansu) and in North
                            China where the resources were badly needed for the furtherance of the
                            Communist industrial development plans. He felt that this heavy
                            sacrifice would not be made without a good reason. The Chinese
                            Communists obviously had something in mind in devoting so much of their
                            resources to this South China military build-up. It was not for nothing.
                            Both he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> knew
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> well. They could
                            both speculate as to just what the Communists had in mind. It might be
                            just a bluff designed to intimidate, but it could also be more than a
                            bluff. It was necessary to base one’s estimates on the assumption that
                            capabilities developed at such cost were intended for use and would not
                            be wasted.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> said that new Communist
                            airfields within striking distance of the off-shore islands and Taiwan
                            now under construction and within sight of completion totaled 10. He
                            said the Communist schedule calls for completion of new airfields at the
                            rate of one a month.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> then produced a
                            photograph of an unexploded Communist shell which he had picked up on
                            Quemoy. He said the type and markings indicated clearly that it was of
                            Russian manufacture. There was no question about Soviet support and
                            supply of the Chinese Communist military machine.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said we had assumed
                            this right along; there was nothing surprising about this
                            information.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> said that 6-inch Soviet
                            guns are being emplaced within artillery range of the Quemoys. The
                            Communists are building a bridge or causeway from Amoy to Tateng which
                            will enable them to step up their artillery pressure on the Quemoys.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> said he anticipated a
                            major attack on the off-shore islands might come next June. He felt that
                            the logical Communist course would be to subject Quemoy and Matsu to
                            heavy aerial bombing, using the newly built fields which are within easy
                            range. General <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> said that in
                            such event he felt it would be imperative for the Chinese Government to
                            reply by knocking out the airfields from which the attacks were
                            launched. He said, “I cannot allow my boys defending the islands to be
                            killed without taking measures to protect them”. He said that if air
                            raids on the off-shore islands were initiated by the Communists, the
                            U.S. would receive a formal request for its concurrence in retaliatory
                            air attacks on the Chinese Communist bases involved.</p>
                        <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0232"/>
                        <p>He remarked that the Chinese Government did not consider any U.S.
                            concurrence to be required for attacks against Communist positions on
                            Tateng or any other off-shore location since the obligation to seek U.S.
                            concurrence applied only to attacks against the Mainland.</p>
                        <p>He realized it was up to the U.S. alone to determine what it would do
                            when Quemoy and Matsu came under attack. He was well aware that the
                            off-shore islands were not protected by the Mutual Defense Treaty, and
                            there was no U.S. obligation. However it was his own personal view that
                            the wisest course would be for the President, using the authority
                            granted him by the Joint Resolution of January 1955, to find that the
                            off-shore islands were an area “related to the defense of Taiwan” and to
                            announce that the U.S. would assist as necessary in repelling a
                            Communist attack on the islands. He felt that an advance announcement by
                            the U.S. to this effect would prevent a Communist attack, and would
                            “stabilize the situation in the entire Far East”. Actually this would be
                            the most prudent course for the U.S. Otherwise the Communists would be
                            encouraged to attack and the U.S. might be unable to control the
                            situation. He felt that once his Government was compelled to respond to
                            air attacks on Quemoy and Matsu, “the hostilities would probably
                            spread”. The Communists would no doubt feel compelled to reply to the
                            Chinese Government counter attacks by striking at the air bases on
                            Taiwan, and no one could predict where the chain reactions would stop.
                            He hoped that the U.S. would associate itself with the denial of Quemoy
                            and Matsu to the Communists since this would be the soundest preventive
                            against the dangerous contingency he had outlined. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> regretted that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> had only 15 minutes for the
                            briefing and said he would hope to continue and expand it after his
                            return from the hospital.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that the
                            disturbing facts concerning the rapid Chinese Communist military build
                            up were already known to him. He had discussed the matter with <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> just the day before.
                            He agreed as to the threatening implications inherent in the Communist
                            build up, mentioning in this connection the construction now under way
                            of a railroad to Amoy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1"
                                >Robertson</persName> stressed that the off-shore islands had not
                            and could not have been included in the Mutual Defense Treaty because
                            there was no finding that the off-shore islands are essential to the
                            security of the U.S. Only the President could exercise the authority and
                            make the determination set forth in the Joint Resolution of
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> recalled that the
                            positions of the two governments had been more or less reversed as to
                            the off-shore islands. Back in 1952 and 1953, the Chinese Government had
                            not shown much interest in improving the defenses of the off-shore
                            islands, <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0233"/>whereas the U.S.
                            Government had encouraged the Chinese Government to build up these
                            defenses and had assisted it to do so. Now we are doubtful as to the
                            strategic essentiality of the off-shore islands, while the Chinese
                            Government is determined to hold the remaining ones at all costs.
                            Although we had advised the Chinese Government to evacuate the Tachens
                            last January, since we considered them to be of no strategic importance
                            and not defensible because of the great distance from Taiwan, we had
                            respected the desire of the Chinese Government to hold Quemoy and Matsu,
                            and the Ambassadorial conversations at Geneva were intended to restrain
                            the Chinese Communists from starting any military action which might
                            jeopardize the off-shore islands. Hence we felt the talks were in the
                            interest of the Chinese Government as well as our own. Mr. <persName

                            <item>There is danger, as pointed out paragraph 3 your 1241, that
                                Communists may go to public with December 1 draft. If they do, we
                                will counter by pointing out as clearly and simply as possible
                                fundamental defect in Communist draft and their refusal to accept
                                our amendment which proves Communists’ intention to be free to use
                                force against Taiwan. In effect, it would leave Communists free to
                                attack Taiwan and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, while
                                preventing US from fulfilling its treaty commitment to go to aid of
                                that government and to use force in individual and collective self
                                defense. We believe this would be strong position, as failure accept
                                our amendment is tantamount to Communists declaring they will use
                                force if they decide to do so.</item>

                        <p>In the course of the discussion of the previous item on this agenda, the
                            Secretary of State asked permission to raise the problem <pb n="210"
                                xml:id="pg_210" facs="0238"/>of export controls imposed by the free
                            world countries on trade with Communist China. He informed the Council
                            that the British had just served notice on us of their intention within
                            a few weeks of reducing their controls on trade with Communist China to
                            a point where the controls on trade with Communist China were the same
                            as the controls on trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            and the European Soviet bloc. This move presented the possibility, said
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, that as a
                            result of unilateral British action the whole system of multilateral
                            controls established under the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> committees would
                            collapse. In order to salvage whatever could be salvaged of the free
                            world’s control system, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> felt that we must agree to something like the
                            British suggestion. If the levels of free world trade with Communist
                            China were going to have to be changed, they had better be changed by
                            the agreement of the free world nations as a whole rather than as a
                            result of unilateral action by individual free world governments.</p>

                                    requirement of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5429/5, that
                                    our efforts to maintain the current differential export control
                                    towards Communist China have passed the stage of being divisive;
                                    they present us with the prospect of total disintegration of the
                                    multilateral control system.</p>
                                <p>“To salvage this system we must accept a graduated reduction in
                                    the China controls to a level which will gain mutual agreement
                                    among countries participating in the Consultative Group. I
                                    recommend that I be authorized to begin negotiations as soon as
                                    possible with the United Kingdom and other interested countries
                                    as appropriate with the aim of preserving the multilateral
                                    control system and, through its orderly procedures, to maintain
                                    the controls over trade with China at the highest negotiable
                                    level but in no event below the level of the Soviet bloc

                            action, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’
                            proposed response.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thoroughly approved of what the Secretary of State
                            was proposing to do, but he wondered whether we could not do it on an
                            individual basis, agreeing to decontrol specific items rather than
                            proceeding to decontrol the entire China Committee list. Clearly the
                            United States would have to modify its previous position, but the
                            President said he hated to see the whole <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                                >CHINCOM</gloss> list torn to bits. Could we not get the British to
                            accept this other proposal of an individual approach to decontrol?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that it
                            seemed perfectly reasonable to him to put trade with Communist China on
                            the same basis as trade with the Soviet European bloc, if for no other
                            reason than that Communist China could get whatever materials it needed
                            via the Russians. Accordingly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> believed the time had come to go <pb n="211"
                                xml:id="pg_211" facs="0239"/>along with the British in their
                            proposal. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said
                            that in any event we didn’t have a real choice in the matter. The Vice
                            President believed that the President’s suggestion of a method seemed a
                            lot better from the point of view of the domestic political
                            repercussions. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>
                            agreed with the Vice President.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the Secretary of State, the President told him to see what
                            kind of deal he could work out with Foreign Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, even including trying to
                            induce the British to adopt the proposal which he, the President, had
                            suggested.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> observed that the
                            course of action proposed by the Secretary of State was of a very
                            serious nature. In point of fact there were very few remaining controls
                            on the level of free world trade with the Soviet European bloc.
                            Moreover, was our own virtually complete embargo on trade with Communist
                            China also going to be discontinued? On this point the President said he
                            thought we were simply making a bow to <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> then went on to point out that the proposed
                            reduction of the levels of trade with Communist China to those of trade
                            with the Soviet Union would deprive us of about our last means of making
                            a deal with the Chinese Communists with respect to Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> argued with
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>, pointing
                            out that the negotiating value of the controls on trade with Communist
                            China had just about reached the zero point. He simply could not hold
                            the dike any longer; his thumb was not big enough. The last time that he
                            had discussed this matter with <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName>, the British Foreign Secretary was not only
                            firm on this course of action, but was positively angry when Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had argued with him.
                            He had insisted that the United Kingdom was a trading country and simply
                            could not live if it was denied the opportunity to trade throughout the
                            world. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> replied
                            that, nonetheless, to reduce our controls on trade with Communist China
                            would have tremendous repercussions. Before we gave in to the British
                            point of view a study should be made of the effects and implications of
                            this course of action. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> predicted that if we went through with this
                            proposal we would be “finished” in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> pointed out that for
                            any discussion of this subject the Secretary of Commerce should be
                            present. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> suggested it
                            might be desirable to staff this problem and to present it to the
                            National Security Council at a later date, with the Secretary of
                            Commerce on hand. The President then inquired of the Secretary of State
                            whether the British could be induced to postpone carrying out their <pb
                                n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0240"/>proposal until after their
                            forthcoming visit to Washington in the latter part of January.<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d116fn4">Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                    >Eden</persName> was scheduled to arrive in Washington for a
                                visit on January 30.</note></p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that it
                            appeared to him that there were two alternatives which we could embrace.
                            We could let the British go ahead and trade with the Chinese Communists
                            while we refused to. This would create a policy split between the U.K.
                            and the U.S. Or, alternatively, we could go along with the British and
                            ourselves trade with Communist China. Whatever we do, said Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, we can be dead sure
                            that the British are going to make a deal with Communist China.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> again warned that
                            if we accepted the British proposal it would require us to reorient our
                            entire policy towards the Far East.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> predicted that
                            the British would prove willing to yield in some degree from the initial
                            position which they were taking and which the Secretary of State had
                            outlined in his letter to the President. Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> also took issue with <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s earlier statement
                            that most of the items which had formerly been subject to multilateral
                            export controls on shipments to the European Soviet bloc, had now
                            actually been decontrolled.</p>
                        <p>Turning to <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he
                            nevertheless simply could not see how we could hold to a tougher line on
                            trade with Communist China than we adhered to on trade with Russia
                            itself. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> replied
                            by pointing out that the proposed course of action would end by placing
                            Japan right under the control of Communist China, on which Japan would
                            be dependent for coal and coke. An entirely new situation was bound to
                            be created in the Far East. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> replied to <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName>, stating that the pressure on the United States
                            by Japan itself to reduce the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                                >CHINCOM</gloss> list to the same level as the <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> list, was of such a nature that we
                            would not be able to induce the Japanese to maintain the existing level
                            of controls on their trade with Communist China much longer.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> inquired whether
                            the National Security Council did not need an intelligence estimate on
                            the effects and implications of this proposed course of action. The
                            President said that this was a fine idea, but could the intelligence
                            estimate be prepared in time? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> was inclined to think it could not. He pointed
                            out that if negotiations between the U.S. and the U.K. on this issue
                            could begin quickly, the United States might be able to salvage quite a
                            lot from the wreck of the multilateral framework of controls on Western
                            trade with Communist China. On the other hand, if we <pb n="213"
                                xml:id="pg_213" facs="0241"/>delay inaugurating negotiations, our
                            negotiating position would be impaired. Indeed, it diminished every week
                            and every day that we waited. The British were going to begin to
                            decontrol items on the China list in the middle of January, and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he could
                            not agree with Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>’s
                            optimistic view that we could drag out negotiations with the British on
                            this subject for months. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                                >Stassen</persName> clung to his position, and said that it was
                            based on much experience in negotiating with the British on the subject
                            of export controls.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that it seemed to him that the Secretary of State
                            would simply have to make the best deal he could with the British.
                            Smiling, the President said we would create the Secretary of State
                            “Chief Salvage Official”. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> reassured the President and the Council that of
                            course he would not “sell out” to the British, and would indeed make the
                            best deal that he could. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> said that he was still terribly concerned about
                            the proposal. When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> pointed out to him that the Chinese got whatever
                            they really needed of Western materials through the Soviet Union,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> replied by
                            pointing out that there was a difference of opinion as to how much
                            Western goods reached China via the Soviet Union. Besides, whatever the
                            Chinese Communists do get in this way they are obliged to pay for. There
                            was a great deal of talk about how the United States must understand the
                            necessities which governed British policy. Was it not now about time for
                            the British to take account of the situation and requirements of the
                            United States?</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that, according to paragraph 7–c–(3) of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5429/5, the Secretary of State was
                            under obligation to report to the National Security Council if our
                            efforts to maintain current export controls toward Communist China had
                            reached the stage of being divisive vis-à-vis our allies. Did <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> think that we should
                            tell our British ally to go to hell?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> replied that he
                            was simply arguing that we ought to have more time, and that the British
                            should give us a chance to talk with them about this proposed course of
                            action before they began unilaterally to carry it out.</p>
                        <p>The President seemed impressed with the point that <persName

                            to the Secretary of State, said don’t fail to remind the British that if
                            they are going to proceed to make all the important decisions before
                            coming to Washington to talk with us, there wasn’t much point in their
                            coming at all. Such a line by the Secretary of State, the President
                            thought, might help him to salvage something more, and if the British
                            agreed it would at least give us the interval until the end of January
                            before the decontroling process began.</p>

                        <p>1263. 1. One hour fifty minute meeting this morning devoted entirely to
                            implementation except for prepared statement by <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> amplifying his replies my questions
                            last meeting on his renunciation of force draft.</p>
                        <p>2. I opened with long prepared statement fully bringing out all points
                            contained <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>s 1352<note n="2"

                        <p>3. After “regretting” I had nothing to say today on his draft <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> made prepared statement amplifying
                            his answers my questions at last meeting particularly regarding
                            applicability draft Taiwan area. He was more specific than previously in
                            saying Taiwan area is heart US-<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                            dispute and as such is international matter going beyond domestic matter
                            of <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>’s dealings with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> clique. New draft is integral
                            whole. <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> still considers removal and
                            reduction tensions in Taiwan area proper subject foreign ministers’
                            meeting but willing discuss these talks if US desires. However refusal
                            discuss and settle this problem would be tantamount to demanding <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> recognize status quo which it will
                            never do. Somewhat more stress than last few meetings on withdrawal US
                            forces as only way remove present threat to <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> then made already prepared
                            statement on implementation which he tied to my previous statement.
                            Largely reiterated former positions on not discussing matter here but
                            through third parties, vague complaints of US violation agreement during
                            which he mentioned alleged new immigration regulations requiring Chinese
                            students obtain entry permits to Taiwan before given date, with regard
                            which they are asking India make presentation. Would not answer many
                            questions from me with respect to implementation until I answer: <list>

                        <p>There was then long give and take during which I stressed not single

                        <p>1269. 1. I opened 29th meeting today with prepared statement on
                            implementation as follows:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>’s prepared
                            statement.]</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> replied that it was in
                            interests of progress our discussions that his side presented new draft
                            last meeting. Was regrettable I had not been able this meeting put
                            forward concrete views U.S. side on that draft. Certainly hoped, as I
                            had stated, would be able put forward latest views on draft at later
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>3. Turning to prepared statement <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName> continued that in view of fact I had raised number
                            questions regarding his draft at last meeting, he was willing make few
                            amplifications on that draft. As I had specifically raised at last
                            meeting question whether draft covered Taiwan area, he willing again
                            amplify statement in explicit manner. It is specified in new draft that
                            China and U.S. should settle disputes between them peacefully without
                            resort to threat of use of force.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said as heart of
                            Sino-American dispute is precisely centered on Taiwan so it goes without
                            saying that new draft covers this question. That I had said describing
                            Taiwan as area where interests and policies China and U.S. clash
                            seriously shows that tension Taiwan area is international matter and not
                            simply domestic matter how to deal with <persName corresp="#p_CK1"

                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said in 1946 <persName

                            proposed as it did at Bandung Conference that China and U.S. enter into
                            negotiations to ease and eliminate tension Taiwan area.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said party which now using
                            force and threat force is none other than U.S. side. However China is
                            not afraid of American force and threats. China not afraid of proposing
                            enter into negotiations precisely because it determined not to yield to
                            American force and threats. I had indicated that U.S. unwilling enter
                            into negotiations under threat Chinese might use force at any time. Fact
                            is contrary. It is Chinese side being threatened and U.S. side which

                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said nonetheless, China

                            peaceful negotiations. Such negotiations aimed at removing force and
                            threat of force which U.S. already applying against China. <gloss

                            two steps. Expresses determination to settle disputes through peaceful
                            means without threat or use force. U.S. side has also indicated it would
                            subscribe this principle. <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> side has
                            taken account of view of U.S. side and draft adds Ambassadors should

                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said <gloss

                            in Taiwan area is too serious to be lightly disposed of in Ambassadorial
                            talks. Settlement these questions should be left to conference Foreign

                            conference between Foreign Ministers China and U.S. for purpose
                            eliminating tension Taiwan area. However, if <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218"

                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said he must stress that
                            new draft is integral whole. Question tension in Taiwan area must be
                            discussed and settled. Refusal discuss would be tantamount to requiring
                            that <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> recognize status quo in Taiwan
                            area and surrender its sovereign rights, which is what <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> side absolutely cannot do.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said new draft has already
                            incorporated common ground in our views. If U.S. really sincere in
                            expressing desire for settlement Sino-American disputes, U.S. side
                            should adopt new draft and then continue discussions between us in order
                            seek settlements.</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> hoped these remarks we had

                                >ChiCom</gloss>s could use to justify such initiation use force. In
                            short do not perceive how <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s
                            draft in any way ties our hands defensively.</p>
                        <p>3. Seems to me important point is that so long as any declaration carries
                            express or implied commitment seek peaceful settlement <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s might claim us failure seek such

                            carried this implication clearer than at any previous meeting. This is
                            one reason I believe it desirable substitute “and” for “without” in
                            second para draft as again suggested preceding tel.</p>
                        <p>4. Another important point is that so long as any declaration
                            incorporates word “threat” <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s
                            are going attempt establish position that by renouncing “threat” we are
                            obliged remove “threat” presence our forces on Taiwan. Of course they
                            will also continue maintain similar position with respect “force”. That
                            is, by stationing forces on Taiwan U.S. has used “force” against <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> territory. However, seems me this can
                            be much more readily handled than point in para 3 above.</p>
                        <p>5. With respect first sentence para 4 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1"
                                >Deptel</gloss> 1353 I do not see that there is necessarily clear
                            choice between declaration some kind and “continued participation in
                            negotiations along present lines”. Gra[nted] <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss>s appear desire continue present negotiations for at
                            least time being, do not see how we can assume they will indefinitely
                            maintain this desire if they do not feel they are obtaining any
                            substantial return. One practical difficulty is that present trend these
                            talks is to reach point in near future at which there will be nothing
                            left to negotiate about.</p>
                        <p>6. Of course similar question also arises as soon as any declaration
                            might be issued as suggested in paras 4 and 5 mytel 1241.<note n="4"

                                renunciation of force draft so that it will make specific reference

                                defense. (Tab B) This draft appears acceptable to us, but it
                                contains the commitment first introduced by <persName

                                disputes between them by peaceful negotiation. If agreement should
                                be reached on this draft, the Communists would immediately seek to
                                push us into negotiations on the Taiwan issue, particularly the

                                the Taiwan area. Refusal by us to negotiate at all would give them
                                plausible ground to claim they had been tricked.</item>

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi></p>
                        <p>(1) That we avoid final agreement on an announcement on renunciation of
                            force until the Communists have released the fourteen Americans they
                            hold or we are confident they will be released; (2) that if agreement is
                            reached on an announcement and the Communists then propose discussing
                            withdrawal of U.S. forces that we take the position that we cannot make
                            agreements on this, but that the disposition of our forces would
                            naturally depend on the military situation there and when the threat of
                            use of force is removed, we would take this into consideration in our
                            deployment of forces. If the Communists press further for discussion of
                            the status of Taiwan and related matters we must insist on the position
                            that these affect the interests of the Government of the Republic of
                            China and we cannot discuss them without the presence of this
                            Government. (Attached as Tab C is a compilation of statements made

                                based upon following considerations: a) as time passes and
                                Communists evasion of commitments under Agreed Announcement becomes
                                more flagrant, we should increase pressure on this issue in order
                                obtain release US citizens and avoid giving impression weakness; b)
                                we consider Communists probably will not break on this issue for
                                their position on it is weak. They have neither made good on their
                                first commitment nor have they been willing agree specifically
                                renounce force in Taiwan area. Furthermore, <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss> situation developing so they would probably hesitate
                                rock boat by breaking now; c) renunciation force issue has been
                                dramatized sufficiently through these talks so as to make resort to
                                force more difficult for them than it was. End <gloss

                                have been asked to pursue the past two meetings” and was “not at all
                                clear as to where we go from here.” He continued: “Yesterday’s
                                session was a very trying one, and towards the end of the meeting I
                                tried to balance myself on the knife’s edge in testing their
                                reaction to the continuation of these talks. It was quite clear to
                                me that they certainly did not want a break, at least at this time,
                                but, as I have said in a telegram last week, I do not think that we

                                still remain hopeful that that agreement will be carried out.

                                >PRC</gloss> failures from propaganda forum, it was evident
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> was under instructions
                            and had no discretion on whether statement would be issued. As
                            additional effort discourage statement, I tied request for recess until
                            January 12 to this serious and disappointing action on their part which
                            would reduce hope progress our talks. This obviously gave <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> considerable pause but he remained
                            firm on issuance of statement while rejecting any linking request for
                            recess to such grounds. However willing consider recess based on holiday
                            period. I did not press question of linkage and finally made straight
                            proposal for recess until January 12. <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName> agreed consider and inform me later. I urged

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> briefly
                            summarized the last Council discussion on this subject. In accordance
                            with the consensus at that meeting he had promptly sent a message to
                            Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d124fn3">The message, dated December 10, is scheduled
                                for inclusion in the economic defense compilation in a forthcoming
                                volume.</note> This message, which had personally been approved by
                            the President, requested a delay in any unilateral British action to
                            reduce the controls on trade with Communist China until the forthcoming
                            visit of the British Prime Minister to Washington. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had added in his message that he
                            could see very little point in any meeting with the British if they took
                            actions of this sort prior to the meeting. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that he had not been quite
                            as blunt in his language as he now sounded, but very nearly so.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had replied that he
                            would suspend any “effective action” by the British until after the
                            Washington meeting.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that,
                            pending the arrival of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, it was highly
                            desirable that a careful study of the U.S. position in response to
                            British pressure should be prepared. Accordingly, an interdepartmental
                            group within the Council on Foreign Economic Policy had been set up to
                            undertake the preparation of this study. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then read language which he
                            suggested should be adopted as the “mandate” for the interdepartmental
                            group’s study.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> predicted that we
                            would be obliged to give way somewhat to British demands if the problem
                            were to be solved. Accordingly, we must determine what minimum
                            concessions to the British point of view would be acceptable to us. By
                            this course of action we may be able to hold the <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> system together.</p>
                        <p>The President said that as he remembered it, the Council had agreed at
                            its last discussion of this subject that it wasn’t eminently sensible to
                            hold completely to our prior rigid position in view of the obvious
                            ability of the Soviet Union to supply to Communist China items which
                            were subject to Western embargo or controls. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that that was indeed his
                            understanding of the prior meeting, and he went on to indicate briefly
                            the rapidly developing communications between the Soviet Union and
                            Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                            there was in existence an agreed National Intelligence Estimate on the
                            general subject of controls on trade with Communist China.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d124fn4"><gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 100–55,
                                “Controls on Trade With Communist China”, January 11, 1955, is
                                scheduled for inclusion in the economic defense compilation in a
                                forthcoming volume.</note> Accordingly, he believed <pb n="227"
                                xml:id="pg_227" facs="0255"/>that the Central Intelligence Agency
                            should be invited to take part in the discussions of the
                            interdepartmental group which was preparing a study of the U.S.
                            position. The President, turning to the Secretary of State, told him to
                            tell Mr. <persName>Dodge</persName> that at the direction of the
                            President he was to consult with the Central Intelligence Agency on
                            intelligence matters which might arise in the course of this study.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> then pointed
                            out that Secretary <persName>Weeks</persName> had been invited to
                            participate with the Council in the discussion of this matter, and might
                            wish to express his views.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Weeks</persName> said that, like everybody else, he
                            had been completely surprised when the British had served notice on us
                            of their intention to lower the controls on their trade with Communist
                            China. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> broke in
                            to say that he, for one, had not been surprised by the British notice,
                            Secretary <persName>Weeks</persName> went on to say that he could not
                            understand why the British had made this move, in view of the high level
                            of British prosperity at the present time. What worried him in
                            particular was the danger to the entire <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>
                            structures posed by the British move. Secretary
                                <persName>Weeks</persName> doubted whether the whole system of
                            multilateral controls could survive many more such unilateral blows.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                            as yet, at least, the British had taken no unilateral action.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Weeks</persName> went on to state that he assumed
                            that whatever the British did the United States had no intention of
                            changing its own policy of embargoing trade with Communist China. This
                            assumption was supported, and Secretary <persName>Weeks</persName> added
                            that, this being the case, an opportunity would be provided for Japan to
                            get an edge on trade with Communist China—if the British would
                            cooperate. Expressing agreement with Secretary
                                <persName>Weeks</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> advised that we should look at this problem with
                            our eyes primarily on Japan rather than on the British. Secretary
                                <persName>Weeks</persName> said that if the British could be induced
                            to give a break to the Japanese in terms of trade with Communist China,
                            they could do so without hurting themselves very much. The President
                            expressed the opinion that if, in the circumstances, the United States
                            retained its embargo on trade with Communist China, the Japanese could
                            be expected to drive the British out of all competition for trade with
                            Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that he
                            felt obliged to express once again the very deep feelings of the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff with respect to the British proposal. In the Defense
                            Department, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1"
                                >Robertson</persName>, it was sensed that the British Board of Trade
                            was pushing this proposal for decontrol down the throat of the British
                            Ministry of Defense. If this was indeed the case, an opportunity was
                            presented to exert influence on British policy. In recent days the
                            British military people had presented the U.S. Defense Department with
                            such a long list of defense matériel which they desired, that the <pb
                                n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0256"/>list amounted to a book. It
                            might be possible to use their desire for this matériel to induce the
                            British to take a more realistic view of the dangers of decontrolling
                            British trade with Communist China. At least the British military people
                            might be in a position to exert some pressure on the civilians who
                            favored this policy.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he had one comment to make on this subject.
                            Hadn’t the history of the world down to this time proved that if you try
                            to dam up international trade, the dam ultimately bursts and the flood
                            overwhelms you? Our trouble was that our domestic political situation
                            compelled us to adopt an absolutely rigid policy respecting our trade
                            with Communist China and the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> pointed out
                            the view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that there should be no relaxation
                            of the multilateral level of controls on trade with Communist China
                            unless and until we could get some kind of settlement of outstanding
                            issues in return for this relaxation.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that he supposed we should be as tough as we can
                            with the British in the forthcoming negotiations on trade with China.
                            Nevertheless, he could not forbear to point out that our own policy on
                            trade with the Communist bloc was a patchwork puzzle. The President said
                            that he could still not understand why we proceed to trade in items with

                        <p>1308. 1. One and one-half hour meeting this morning.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> insisted on opening making
                            strongest charges to date of US stalling, “insincerity” and renewing
                            line of last meeting on implementation. Made special reference to cruel

                            invitation to me to rehash implementation discussion last few

                            renunciation of force. However, believe this was forestalled by my
                            subsequent statement along lines <gloss target="#t_Deptel1"

                            which, however, I stated in somewhat less categorical fashion.</p>
                        <p>4. In reply he reiterated points his opening statement and in noting my
                            statement re discussion his draft proposed January 12 meeting said: “I
                            should say that that would be the last opportunity for us to reach an
                            agreement on basis our new draft. We can permit no further delay.
                            Otherwise we will be compelled to make public the proceedings of our

                            In reply he did not withdraw statement but denied it was threat. He
                            proposed and during subsequent give and take strongly insisted on next
                            meeting January 6. I indicated I could not give any assurances would be

                        <p>To estimate: (a) the political, economic, and military strengths and
                            weaknesses of Communist China; (b) Sino-Soviet relations; and (c)

                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. The Chinese Communists have firmly established their control
                            throughout mainland China, and are energetically attempting to
                            reorganize economic and social institutions and build military power
                            along the lines of the Soviet model. With Soviet help, the armed forces
                            have been greatly strengthened and to a large extent modernized, and
                            economic output has for the most part reached or surpassed previous
                            peaks. As a result of its achievements and growing power, Communist
                            China’s prestige and influence in Asia have greatly increased. (<hi

                        <p>2. The Chinese Communist regime is determined to convert its primarily
                            agricultural economy into an industrialized Soviet-style state. To this
                            end it has scheduled large investments over the next few years and, to
                            mobilize resources for the program, has taken measures to restrain
                            consumption and to step up its program for socializing agriculture. In
                            pursuit of its goals, the government will encounter serious problems in
                            the lack of trained personnel, in peasant resistance to government
                            control, and in growing apathy or opposition among the people to the
                            regime’s austerity measures. Moreover, as Peiping confronts these
                            problems and attempts to deal with the difficulties of socialization,
                            shifts in the influence of leaders may occur and purges may be expected,
                            especially at lower levels. However, we believe that Peiping’s control
                            apparatus will be adequate to maintain the stability of the regime. (<hi

                        <p>3. We estimate that by 1957 the Chinese Communists will attain many of
                            the goals of their first Five Year Plan, which emphasizes heavy
                            industry, though there will be shortfalls in steel, pig iron, trucks,
                            petroleum products, and food crops. (See table and note on page
                                12.)<note n="3" xml:id="d126fn3">Not printed.</note> They will
                            probably not be able to develop certain of their planned capacities. The
                            gross value of industrial output will probably increase about 75 percent
                            during the Plan period as against the goal <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232"
                                facs="0260"/>of 98 percent. By 1960 the Chinese Communist industrial
                            base, which in 1952 was less than one-third that of Japan and produced
                            only a limited range of manufactured goods, will have greatly expanded,
                            though production in key industries will still be well below that of
                            Japan in 1954. Communist China will still require considerable Bloc
                            assistance to meet its economic needs. We believe that agricultural
                            output will increase by about 10 percent instead of the 23 percent
                            planned by the Chinese Communists but that this will not necessarily
                            affect their industrial goals. However, should agricultural output fail
                            to make this limited increase, industrial goals will almost certainly be
                            adversely affected. (<hi rend="italic">Paras. 42, 59, 92, and Chart II,

                        <p>4. Communist China, with extensive Soviet aid, will have further
                            strengthened and modernized its armed forces by 1960. In the absence of
                            extensive US counteraction, Peiping will retain the capability to
                            overrun South Korea, Taiwan, and mainland Southeast Asia. However,
                            Communist China will still suffer from military weaknesses, particularly
                            air defense deficiencies and lack of an adequate indigenous armaments
                            base. We have no evidence that Communist China possesses any nuclear
                            weapons, and it has only a primitive nuclear research capability.
                            However, if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were to provide
                            the necessary equipment and technicians, the Chinese Communists could in
                            a short time achieve the capability to use nuclear weapons. (<hi

                        <p>5. The relationship between Communist China and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has become one of an alliance bound
                            together not only by ideological ties, but by common hostility to the
                            US, military interdependence, and the mutual advantages of concerted
                            diplomatic and “revolutionary” activities. Peiping’s military and
                            economic dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will
                            cause it to continue to give Moscow’s views great weight on major
                            questions of global policy. However, Peiping’s tactical position in many
                            areas gives it considerable potential for influencing Moscow. Although
                            potential conflicts of interest exist, we believe that common objectives
                            and mutual advantage, and Peiping’s continuing dependence on Moscow,
                            will serve to prevent any significant weakening of Sino-Soviet ties at
                            least through 1960. (<hi rend="italic">Paras. 95, 98–100,
                            102–103</hi>)</p>
                        <p>6. Chinese Communist foreign policy will continue to be focused on
                            gaining control of Taiwan, reducing Western (and especially US)
                            influence in Asia, and extending their own in the area. Peiping will
                            continue to pursue policies emphasizing political rather than military
                            action as long as its objectives are acceptably served by this means.
                            The major factor in this consideration will be their estimate of the
                            risk of US military counteraction; thus Communist China will probably
                                <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0261"/>emphasize political action
                            over the next two or three years. The Communists may again resort to
                            military action at any time they estimate that the benefits to be
                            obtained will outweigh the military consequences of such action. In
                            behalf of the joint Sino-Soviet policy of “competitive coexistence with
                            the capitalist bloc,” Peiping is likely to play up to neutralist and
                            nationalist sentiment in Asia, manipulate the Indochina and Taiwan
                            issues to divide the West, and exploit such vulnerable situations as
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japanese and Indian-Pakistani
                            tensions to win further Asian support for the Bloc. The Chinese
                            Communists will probably endeavor to have their approach to
                            international problems characterized as conciliatory and flexible, but
                            Bloc policy will probably permit no major concessions to the West and
                            its Asian allies. At times, in fact, Peiping will probably assert its
                            power ostentatiously, but within the general limits of Bloc strategy, in
                            order to reaffirm its particular claims and pretensions. (<hi
                                rend="italic">Paras. 105–106, 112– 113</hi>)</p>
                        <p>7. The Chinese Communists will probably continue their buildup in the
                            area opposite Taiwan and the offshore islands in order to increase
                            pressure on the US and Nationalist positions. They probably do not
                            intend to attack Taiwan so long as the US maintains its commitments to
                            the Nationalists, but they may expect to induce a gradual erosion of the
                            Nationalist position. Moreover, unless Peiping comes to believe that it
                            can obtain the offshore islands by negotiation, it will almost certainly
                            conduct probing operations against them. If the Chinese Communists
                            became convinced that the US would not assist in defense of the islands
                            with its own forces, or react in strength elsewhere, they probably would
                            attempt to seize them. Should Peiping’s forces successfully occupy the
                            Nationalist-held offshore islands without incurring US military
                            retaliation, there would be an intensification of the campaign to obtain
                            Taiwan. (<hi rend="italic">Para. 119</hi>)</p>
                        <p>8. Peiping will continue its efforts, in conjunction with the Hanoi
                            regime, to expand Communist influence and control in South Vietnam by
                            attempting to discredit and undermine the authority of the Diem
                            government through propaganda and diplomacy. Even if the Viet Minh are
                            delayed in extending their control over South Vietnam, Peiping will
                            probably not encourage the Viet Minh to renew open hostilities. However,
                            at some point Peiping probably will encourage increased Viet Minh
                            guerrilla activity in South Vietnam. Actions beyond that phase would
                            probably depend upon the effectiveness of Diem’s counteraction and the
                            response of the US and the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                            powers. (<hi rend="italic">Para. 121</hi>)</p>
                        <p>9. The possibility of a Communist-initiated war in the Taiwan Straits,
                            Vietnam, Laos, and even Korea will continue to exist. Moreover, Peiping
                            would almost certainly react with force if Communist <pb n="234"
                                xml:id="pg_234" facs="0262"/>control of North Korea or North Vietnam
                            were seriously threatened. It would almost certainly retaliate to any
                            sharp increase in the level of Nationalist attacks against the mainland.

                        <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                        <p>10. The basic objectives of the Chinese Communists appear to be: (a) to
                            develop a Soviet-style state in China with a strong industrial economy
                            and a modern military establishment; (b) to eliminate Western (and
                            especially US) influence and power and to achieve dominance in East
                            Asia; (c) to establish control over Taiwan and other areas which they
                            regard as traditionally Chinese; (d) to achieve recognition as a major
                            world power; and (e) in general, to promote the goals of international
                            communism.</p>
                        <p>11. Since its formal establishment in Peiping in 1949, the Communist
                            regime has shown flexibility, skill, and ruthless determination and has
                            made significant progress toward the achievement of its goals. Its
                            authority is firmly established and its control effective throughout the
                            mainland area. War-torn and neglected industry and communications were
                            largely rehabilitated by 1952, production in most important sectors has
                            reached or surpassed prewar peaks, and socialization on the Soviet model
                            is well advanced in all fields except agriculture and retail trade. The
                            armed forces have made great progress in the evolution from lightly
                            armed formations to well-organized regular units with modern Soviet
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p>12. The regime has also greatly enhanced the influence and prestige of
                            Communist China in Asia. Its power and ability to influence Asian
                            developments were demonstrated in Korea and Indochina. Its stature among
                            Asian states has been enhanced by its skillful diplomacy at Bandung and
                            by the establishment of contact with the US on the ambassadorial level.
                            Strong pressures have developed in the Free World for a reduction of
                            controls on trade with Communist China and for its entry into the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Meanwhile, the Sino-Soviet alliance has
                            given Peiping considerable strategic security and access to the material
                            resources of the Bloc, both of which have greatly reduced Peiping’s
                            vulnerability to non-Communist pressures.</p>
                        <p>13. However, during the period of this estimate Peiping almost certainly
                            will not sustain the momentum of its first five years. The Chinese
                            Communists have only recently come to grips with the basic problems
                            involved in the creation of a socialized national economy, and these
                            will be difficult to resolve even with the benefit of Soviet
                            experience.</p>

                        <p>14. The Chinese Communists define the present stage of their internal
                            development as “the transition to socialism.” while they are relying on
                            Soviet experience, their tactics continue to be modified by Chinese
                            Communist experience and by flexibility toward groups which they regard
                            as basically hostile. Peiping has sought to utilize the party’s monopoly
                            of power and the state’s direct control of economic key points to coerce
                            the remaining private producers of goods and services into accepting
                            socialist economic forms. Periods of pressure and social change have
                            been followed by brief respites. This tactic of “tension and release”
                            has been applied in recent years both to unnerve the populace and to
                            destroy whatever cohesiveness and independent leadership the
                            intellectuals, private entrepreneurs, and well-to-do peasants may have
                            possessed.</p>

                        <p>15. The government of Communist China has recently been reorganized, with
                            control further centralized in Peiping. Although the constitution of
                            September 1954 vests formal governmental responsibility in the National
                            Peoples’ Congress, this body is primarily a forum for publicizing
                            already decided policy. Between the infrequent sessions of the Congress,
                            most of its functions are exercised by its Standing Committee. The
                            Standing Committee has nominal supervision over the State Council, which
                            in turn directs all the central government ministries, including the
                            Ministry of Defense, and supervises the operation of provincial and
                            local governments and the governments of “autonomous” minority areas.

                        <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName>’s position under the new

                            governmental affairs, and important areas of influence appear to have
                            been delegated to other leaders. <persName>Liu Shao-chi</persName>, who
                            ranks next to <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> in the party
                            hierarchy, seems to control the party organization; <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>, who ranks third in the
                            Politburo, has become the dominant figure in government administration
                            and foreign affairs; and <persName>Chen Yun</persName> seems to have the
                            largest role in economic affairs. Although Chu Teh is a venerated
                            military leader and Vice Chairman of the “Peoples Republic of China,” he
                            is nearly 70, and <persName>Peng Te-huai</persName>, newly appointed as
                            Minister of Defense, has assumed active leadership of the armed
                            forces.</p>

                        <p>18. The first high-level party purge since 1938 took place during 1954
                            when Kao Kang, state planning chief and sixth-ranking member of the
                            Politburo, and Jao Shu-shih, party organizational chief, were removed
                            from the party and imprisoned together with a number of their
                            associates. Kao’s death has since been announced, but Jao’s fate is
                            unknown. Kao and Jao had both been veteran members of the Central
                            Committee and had been the ranking party leaders in Northeast and East
                            China respectively until 1953.</p>
                        <p>19. While the actual details of the Kao-Jao affair still remain shrouded
                            in mystery, the chief reason for the purge was probably an effort by
                            Kao, Jao, and their supporters to broaden their own power. Despite
                            official denials, some differences over issues of domestic policy may
                            have been involved. Kao and Jao may also have attempted to make common
                            cause with some of the military leaders, but apparently with little
                            success, since no ranking military men have yet been involved in their
                            disgrace.</p>
                        <p>20. In any event, there is no evidence that the purges have had any
                            lasting effect on the stability of the inner core of party leadership or
                            its ability to control the party. Simultaneously with the purge
                            announcement in April 1955, the party announced a new control commission
                            to check on party discipline. As the regime confronts the problems of
                            socialization, shifts in the influence of leaders may occur and purges
                            may be expected, especially at lower levels.</p>
                        <p>21. The question of <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName>’s successor
                            will grow in importance since <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName>
                            is now 62 and possibly in poor health. It is doubtful if any individual
                            in the event of <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName>’s death would
                            be in a position for some time to assume the full authority held by him,
                            and an effort would probably be made to establish some sort of
                            collective leadership.</p>
                        <p>22. <persName>Liu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Rockefeller</persName> would probably be in the best positions to
                            bid for pre-eminence. <persName>Liu</persName>, second only to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> in formal party listings, is known
                            as a theorist whose attention has been largely focused on internal party
                            matters. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Rockefeller</persName> has had a
                            broader range of experience and contacts and has a reputation for
                            tactical elasticity. However, their expressed views on major policies
                            have not been in conflict. Barring any major setbacks to the regime, the
                            differing backgrounds of these and other leaders appear more likely to
                            serve as complementary forces in implementing agreed policy than as
                            causes of serious conflict.</p>
                        <p>23. Although the prestige of the army and the role of its leaders remain
                            great, the direct role of the army in planning and policy has been
                            steadily curtailed, particularly since the dissolution of the regional
                            governments in 1952–1954. The newly created National Defense Council
                            appears to be largely an advisory body less powerful than its
                            predecessor, the People’s Revolutionary Military Council. <pb n="237"
                                xml:id="pg_237" facs="0265"/>Control of most of the internal
                            security forces has been taken away from the armed forces and placed
                            under the Minister of Public Security. There appears to be increasing
                            integration of the civil and military elements of the government.</p>
                        <p>24. There is firm evidence of actual conflict between professional
                            military leaders and the primarily political group. It is possible that
                            there may have been some sympathy among military commanders for the
                            alleged belief of Kao Kang that “the party was created by the army” and
                            that those with party experience in the old revolutionary base areas
                            should take precedence over nonmilitary leaders. However, the high party
                            status of many military commanders gives them a vested interest in the
                            regime, and the long established system of political officers within the
                            army provides a constant check on the activities of military leaders. We
                            believe that there is little prospect of differences which would
                            seriously affect the cohesion or stability of the regime during the
                            period of this estimate.</p>
                        <p>25. The Chinese Communist Party, with a membership of over eight million
                            or 1.33 percent of the population, is substantially smaller in
                            proportion to population than Communist parties in other Bloc countries.
                            Although there is no shortage of potential members, there is a serious
                            problem in quality and political reliability. An eight-year program of
                            systematic political indoctrination was initiated in 1955 for some five
                            million party members and nonparty intellectuals. Despite these efforts
                            to improve the quality of the party, governmental efficiency will
                            continue to be hampered by low levels of literacy and by friction
                            between old revolutionaries and new bureaucrats.</p>
                        <p>26. <hi rend="italic">Popular attitudes and support</hi>. Tight control
                            and a series of repressive campaigns since 1951 have dissipated some of
                            the support the regime initially enjoyed, leaving much of the populace
                            disillusioned or disaffected. Discontent mounted during 1954 and civil
                            disobedience at the local level increased. Official announcements allege
                            that there were 364,604 cases of “subversion” and “economic sabotage”
                            from February 1954 to May 1955. These activities occurred in both urban
                            and rural areas throughout Communist China. The principal causes appear
                            to have been local food shortages resulting from the floods and droughts
                            of 1954, the pushing of grain collection and agricultural socialization,
                            and the forced austerity program. Discontent seems to be particularly
                            marked among the peasantry, and at least one open “peasant revolt” is
                            admitted to have taken place in April 1955.</p>
                        <p>27. Communist efforts to remold the traditional Chinese social system
                            have also met with considerable resistance. Their attempts to destroy
                            family proprietorship and family cohesion have generated widespread
                            resentment. The regime has slackened its efforts to enforce <pb n="238"
                                xml:id="pg_238" facs="0266"/>its marriage law, and reform of the
                            family is now being attempted primarily by the indoctrination of
                            youth.</p>
                        <p>28. Chinese intellectuals, many of whom have been educated in the West or
                            exposed to Western thought, also pose a serious problem to the regime,
                            which is still dependent on their skills. The campaign to obtain their
                            conformity was accelerated in May 1955 when Hu Feng, a writer who
                            pressed for greater freedom of expression, was accused of leading a vast
                            conspiracy against the state. Abject confessions by intellectuals were
                            published and mass meetings were organized to denounce and expunge “the
                            remnants of Hu Feng thought” in such widely diverse fields as medicine
                            and plant management.</p>
                        <p>29. At present, popular discontent is too sporadic and disorganized to
                            pose a serious threat to the stability of the Peiping regime. The recent
                            emphasis on security and the heightening of vigilance during the past
                            year may have been partly intended to provide a rationale for continued
                            austerity and stringent economic controls by creating an atmosphere of
                            fear and tension. The regime now has a large and effective control
                            system, including an internal security force of about 500,000 men in
                            addition to the army. At the local level, a system of “security defense
                            committees,” “urban residents’ committees,” and other mass organizations
                            provides additional controls which extend into every street and small
                            community. As the process of socialization progresses over the next five
                            years, popular discontent, particularly in rural areas, is almost sure
                            to increase. However, the regime will almost certainly be able to
                            repress such discontent.</p>

                        <p>68. <hi rend="italic">Foreign trade and Soviet assistance</hi>. Communist
                            China is dependent on imports for essential elements of its industrial
                            and military programs. Fifteen percent, or $2.75 billion, of capital
                            construction expenditures under the Five Year Plan are allocated for
                            imports of machinery and equipment, while expanding industrial output is
                            increasing import needs for raw materials and other production
                            requisites. However, except for grants and credits supplied by the
                            Soviet Bloc, Communist China’s ability to obtain such goods is presently
                            limited by its dependence on agricultural exports. Agricultural
                            commodities accounted for about two-thirds of total Chinese Communist
                            exports in 1954. Chinese Communist ability to trade is also adversely
                            affected by the complete closure of the US market and by lesser
                            restrictions <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0267"/>maintained by
                            other Free World countries on exports to Communist China. Finally, Bloc
                            markets are apparently having difficulties absorbing certain Chinese
                            Communist exports.</p>
                        <p>69. The Chinese Communists announced that their total foreign trade in
                            1954 amounted to the equivalent of roughly $3.4 billion. Although they
                            claim that their foreign trade was “fundamentally in balance,” we
                            believe there was probably an excess of imports covered by Soviet Bloc
                            credits. While the nature of such imports and Soviet property acquired
                            by such credits in 1954 is not known, there are indications that the
                            total value could have been as high as $400 to $500 million.</p>
                        <p>70. Communist China’s trade became increasingly oriented toward the Bloc
                            in 1954. Trade with the Asian and European Satellites increased
                            significantly over 1953 levels and remained at approximately the same
                            level with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, excluding that
                            covered by Soviet credits. Even after taking into account Satellite
                            resales of Chinese Communist goods to non-Bloc countries, the Bloc still
                            accounted for about three-fourths of Communist China’s trade.</p>
                        <p>71. In 1954 the value of Chinese Communist total trade with the Free
                            World was greater than in 1952 and probably approximately the same as in
                            1953. However, there were sharp increases in trade with Japan and
                            Pakistan. The recorded exports of the principal non-Communist countries
                            to Communist China in 1954 were: <table rows="14" cols="2">

                        <p>The tonnage of Free World exports to Communist China has increased
                            steadily from 497,000 tons in 1952 to 692,000 in 1953, and to 858,000
                            tons in 1954.</p>
                        <p>72. The Chinese Communists have stated that their foreign trade in 1954
                            totalled over 9 million tons. We believe that this is an incomplete <pb
                                n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0268"/>figure, and that the total may
                            have amounted to between 10 and 11 million tons. About 5.1 million tons
                            moved by sea compared to 4.8 million tons in 1953. Almost all of
                            Communist China’s trade with the non-Communist countries, and about 25
                            percent of its trade with Bloc countries, was carried by sea. The bulk
                            of Communist China’s trade with the Bloc was carried overland.</p>
                        <p>73. To meet requirements of the Five Year Plan, the Chinese Communists
                            propose to increase total foreign trade by 65 percent during the period,
                            primarily through expanded exports of minerals, handicraft products, and
                            agricultural products. It is estimated that Communist China could
                            readily expand its exports of coking coal and iron ore (e.g., to Japan)
                            without substantial new investment. However, Communist China may have
                            trouble marketing increased quantities of handicraft and higher priced
                            agricultural products to Bloc countries because there is a question of
                            the ability of the latter to absorb such increases or profitably to
                            re-export them. The decline of Chinese Communist exports to the Free
                            World has stimulated Free World production and use of substitutes for
                            some traditional Chinese Communist products.</p>
                        <p>74. Although increased trade with the Free World would almost certainly
                            develop if present trade controls were relaxed to the level maintained
                            with the European Bloc, such increases would probably not constitute a
                            substantial reorientation of Chinese Communist trade. Such a relaxation
                            of trade controls, if it included those of the US, would not greatly
                            increase Communist China’s ability to secure commodities not now
                            available through transshipment, but would permit an increase in exports
                            to markets not now open and would reduce import costs on certain items.
                            We believe that such a relaxation of controls could increase Communist
                            China’s annual import capabilities by about $150 million, of which about
                            two-thirds would be due to the reduction of US controls. The total of
                            $150 million is roughly equal to about a quarter of Communist China’s
                            imports of capital goods, including iron and steel, and about 5 to 10
                            percent of the adjusted value of Communist China’s capital investment
                            program in 1955. To that extent, the buildup of Communist China’s
                            economic and military potential could be accelerated. There would also
                            be a reduction in internal Bloc transport costs, amounting to
                            approximately $100 million equivalent. It is impossible for us to
                            allocate such savings as between Communist China and the other Bloc
                            countries. A relaxation of controls would increase flexibility in
                            planning, procurement, and shipment. However, it probably would not
                            result in any significant changes in Communist China’s basic foreign or
                            domestic policies.</p>
                        <p>75. Peiping has exploited the issue of trade controls to divide the US
                            from its allies and has charged that US insistence on controls is <pb
                                n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0269"/>responsible for economic
                            difficulties in Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, and other Asian
                            countries. If controls were relaxed, Peiping would continue its
                            propaganda campaign against the US, but would seek to expand trade
                            contacts with other Asian states, especially Japan, and would continue
                            to use trade as a means of penetration and trade offers as an instrument
                            for political warfare.<note n="5" xml:id="d126fn5">The political effects
                                of reducing trade controls are considered in SNIE 100–56, “Political

                                17 January 1956. [Footnote in the source text.]</note></p>
                        <p>76. An increase in trade controls on Communist China alone would probably
                            increase the volume of transshipped goods but would not appreciably
                            retard Communist China’s internal development. However, if all Western
                            countries now applying controls were to apply an embargo on Chinese
                            imports similar to that now observed by the US, Communist China would
                            lose markets now taking almost 20 percent of total exports. Since Bloc
                            markets are not believed to be readily expandable, it is probable that
                            Communist China’s import capabilities would be reduced proportionately,
                            unless Soviet Bloc credits were increased. Such a reduction in export
                            earnings would probably significantly retard Communist China’s internal
                            development.</p>
                        <p>77. Soviet credits have been an important factor in helping Communist
                            China obtain imports. The value of announced Soviet economic aid totals
                            $430 million, made up of a $300 million credit extended during 1950–1954
                            for rehabilitation and reconstruction, and a $130 million credit
                            extended in 1954. In addition, Chinese Communist budget announcements
                            since 1950 have indicated that other Soviet credits have been given to
                            Communist China. In 1954, the amount appears to have been $400 million.
                            In 1955, the amount apparently was larger, with the major portion
                            earmarked for military purchases.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Military Situation</hi></p>
                        <p>78. The power of the Chinese Communist regime is based on the strength of
                            its armed forces and its great reservoir of potential military manpower.
                            Since the end of the Korean War, Communist China has strengthened and to
                            a large extent modernized its military establishment. However, it
                            continues to depend on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for
                            heavy armaments, complex equipment, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>,
                            and almost all naval and air equipment.</p>
                        <p>79. <hi rend="italic">Army</hi>. The Chinese Communist army consists of
                            about 2,500,000 men organized in 115 infantry, 22 artillery, 4 cavalry,
                            3 armored, and 1 to 3 airborne divisions, as well as other miscellaneous
                            units. Approximately 40 percent of army strength is located in North and
                            Northeast China and Korea, and another 40 percent in East and <pb
                                n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0270"/>Central South China, with
                            relatively few troops in the interior. (See Map 2.)</p>
                        <p>80. Substantial improvements in organization, equipment, and training
                            have been made since the end of the Korean War. Actual strength of most
                            infantry divisions is estimated at 15,000 men, and division organization
                            includes an artillery regiment of 36 field pieces. Tank regiments are
                            believed to be organic to the army troops of 2 of the 37 armies and to
                            16 of the 115 infantry divisions. Standard armored division equipment
                            includes 80 medium tanks, 8 heavy tanks, and 8 self-propelled guns.
                            Twelve of the artillery divisions are field artillery, standard
                            equipment of which includes 108 pieces of calibers up to 152 mm.
                            However, the amount of equipment actually present in armored and
                            artillery units is believed to be somewhat less than <gloss
                                target="#t_TOE1">TO&amp;E</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>81. General army morale is believed to be high because of increased
                            professionalization and ideological indoctrination as well as the
                            privileged social status accorded the soldier. The adoption of universal
                            conscription in July 1955 will probably increase service morale by
                            fixing the terms of service and rationalizing induction methods.
                            However, a significant increase in general popular disaffection,
                            particularly among the peasants, might adversely affect the morale of
                            many servicemen.</p>
                        <p>82. The numerical strength of the Chinese Communist army will probably
                            not increase through 1960 unless the Chinese Communists feel themselves
                            faced with imminent large-scale war. However, beginning in 1958, the
                            conscription law will increase the body of trained reserves by requiring
                            reserve duty of most of the estimated 450,000–600,000 troops to be
                            discharged annually and an unspecified number of men under 40 with no
                            previous service.</p>
                        <p>83. By 1960 the army is expected to have completed the process of
                            incorporating a tank regiment and increased artillery and heavy weapons
                            into each infantry division. Standardization of light weapons of Chinese
                            Communist manufacture and heavy armaments of Soviet manufacture will be
                            virtually complete.</p>
                        <p>84. Chinese Communist vulnerability to air attack has caused them to
                            place considerable emphasis on antiaircraft defense. Most combat
                            divisions now include antiaircraft battalions for local protection. Five
                            antiaircraft divisions and some 19 independent antiaircraft regiments
                            have been identified. Fire control equipment, especially radar, appears
                            to be in short supply. With expected increases in equipment and further
                            training during the period of this estimate, the Chinese Communists will
                            probably develop a substantial antiaircraft capability.</p>
                        <p>85. <hi rend="italic">Air Forces</hi>. Chinese Communist air (including
                            naval air) forces have an estimated total strength of 2,270 planes
                            (including 1,485 jets) <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0271"/>and
                            about 80,000 personnel. Through 1960 the principal offensive air weapon
                            will be the jet light bomber force, which presently consists of an
                            estimated 310 Beagles and which will probably reach approximately 590 by
                            1960. Although presently stationed mainly in bases near Korea and
                            Taiwan, this bomber force could be redeployed so as to reach any target
                            in [Southeast] Asia north of the Malay Peninsula and the southern
                            Philippines. (See Map 2.) It is handicapped by lack of combat experience
                            and fighter escort capability. Communist China has only 10 piston medium
                            bombers (Bulls), and is expected to have no more than 60 by 1960. These
                            could reach targets as far away as Guam and Singapore. It will probably
                            not acquire its first jet medium bombers before 1960.</p>
                        <p>86. Communist China’s air defense capability lies mainly in its estimated
                            1,175 jet fighters, and its core of combat veteran pilots. This force is
                            considered combat-ready under visual operating conditions. Replacement
                            of the few remaining piston fighters with Soviet jets should be
                            completed by mid-1956, and the development of an all-weather force will
                            probably begin shortly thereafter. Some 570 all-weather fighters may be
                            added to the air force by mid-1960. Total fighter strength will probably
                            reach a peak of about 1,600 jet fighters in mid-1958. Despite
                            difficulties in construction and supply, Communist China has greatly
                            improved its base structure in the coastal area opposite Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>87. <hi rend="italic">Navy</hi>. With the aid and technical advice of the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the Chinese Communist navy
                            has reached a present modest strength of 4 destroyers, 13 submarines, 50
                            patrol escorts and gunboats, 118 motor torpedo boats, 13 mining vessels,
                            and 56 amphibious craft. A number of small Soviet vessels may recently
                            have been delivered to the Chinese Communists along with the transfer of
                            Port Arthur.</p>
                        <p>88. Although there are indications that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> may have recently helped the Chinese Communists launch
                            an accelerated program of naval construction, the development of the
                            navy through 1960 will probably continue to depend primarily on material
                            received from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Chinese
                            Communists will continue to possess sufficient air and naval strength to
                            control the air and sea spaces necessary for amphibious operations in
                            the Taiwan Straits and offshore island areas provided the US does not
                            intervene. They will develop a capability for medium range submarine
                            operations and will probably further develop their mine warfare and
                            surface capabilities for conducting defensive operations in coastal
                            waters. These factors, coupled with existing air power, will probably
                            give them during the period of this estimate a significant capability to
                            oppose hostile forces operating in coastal waters.</p>
                        <p>89. Naval air force strength (included in paragraph 85) is 185 planes and
                            4,700 personnel. The development of Chinese Communist <pb n="244"
                                xml:id="pg_244" facs="0272"/>naval aviation has recently received
                            considerable emphasis, probably reflecting a need to perform standard
                            naval missions such as support of amphibious landings, antisubmarine
                            patrol, convoy escort, search and rescue, reconnaissance, and mining. It
                            is also possible that, following the Soviet pattern, the defense of
                            certain coastal areas and bases is assigned to naval air. In any event,
                            it is known that re-equipment of the naval air force with jet aircraft
                            is being given high priority.</p>
                        <p>90. The Chinese Communists have sufficient conventional amphibious type
                            ships to provide lift for 35,000 to 45,000 troops with some armor,
                            supporting weapons, and limited transportation, or a maximum of 70,000
                            lightly armed infantry troops. As of mid-1955 the Chinese Communist
                            merchant marine included 111 vessels (1,000 GRT upward) totalling
                            278,000 gross tons with an estimated cargo capacity of 417,000 long
                            tons. Utilization of this shipping could provide additional lift for
                            about 200,000 troops. However, considering the special problems of
                            phasing, control, and protection of forces peculiar to an amphibious
                            operation and the necessity for logistic re-supply and reinforcement
                            lift capacity, it is estimated that a Chinese Communist initial assault
                            force would be limited to 75,000-100,000 troops.</p>
                        <p>91. <hi rend="italic">Nuclear capabilities</hi>. We have no evidence that
                            Communist China possesses any nuclear weapons, and it has only a
                            primitive nuclear research capability. However, if the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were to provide the necessary
                            equipment and technicians, the Chinese Communists could in a short time
                            achieve the capability to use nuclear weapons. A recent Soviet pledge to
                            supply a 6,500 kilowatt nuclear reactor, a laboratory for handling
                            radioactive materials, and an unspecified number of 25 Mev cyclotrons to
                            Communist China in the next few years and to train Chinese Communist
                            atomic scientists could, if carried out, lead to a small Chinese
                            Communist nuclear research program by 1960. This aid appears to be of
                            most use in such fields as medicine and biology, and additional Soviet
                            assistance of a different nature and on a scale much larger than
                            announced would be required to initiate a nuclear weapons or power
                            program.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Communist China in 1960</hi></p>
                        <p>92. Through 1960, the Chinese Communist economy, barring such unforeseen
                            contingencies as a major war or a series of natural disasters, will
                            probably have continued to expand, although at a lower rate than during
                            the first Five Year Plan. The bulk of modern industry will probably be
                            state-owned and most peasants will be in some form of cooperative. From
                            1952-1960 Communist China will probably have about tripled its electric
                            power output, more than doubled its coal production, and increased the
                            value of its machine <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0273"/>industry
                            some two and one-half times. However, even with these substantial
                            increases, Communist China’s industrial base will remain small. Crude
                            steel production probably will not be more than 5 million tons, or some
                            2.8 million tons below Japan’s 1954 level.<note n="6" xml:id="d126fn6"
                                >See note to table on page 12. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                            Its estimated electric power output of about 21 billion KWH will be 39
                            billion KWH below the 1954 Japanese output. Moreover, at best the rate
                            of increase of agricultural production will only approximate the growth
                            of population. Under these circumstances, the regime will continue to
                            have great difficulty in meeting its increasing investment and export
                            requirements. Finally, continued dependence on the sources outside
                            Communist China for a wide range of complex industrial items and a
                            shortage of skilled technicians will complicate planned economic
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>93. The Chinese Communists will have greatly increased their military
                            capabilities. Against indigenous military forces, Peiping will remain
                            capable of overrunning South Korea, Taiwan and the offshore islands, and
                            mainland Southeast Asia. However, Communist China will still suffer from
                            military weaknesses, particularly air defense deficiencies and lack of
                            an adequate indigenous armaments base. Chinese Communist dependence on
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for vehicles, <gloss
                                target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>, and almost all complex military
                            equipment will continue through 1960. Communist China will probably be
                            self-sufficient only in light weapons and individual equipment.</p>
                        <p>94. The control system will be under increasing pressure. In particular,
                            increased demands for food will conflict with the regime’s program to
                            develop large reserves and to increase exports of foodstuffs and the
                            acreage devoted to industrial crops. Although the regime might make some
                            modifications of its investment program in the event of a series of bad
                            crop years to increase the availability of consumption goods, it
                            probably would not make major concessions. Its control mechanism will
                            probably be adequate to enforce progress toward its economic goals, but
                            the regime will probably have to resort to purges and to terror,
                            particularly against the peasants. Popular support for the regime is
                            likely to decline further among peasants and intellectuals, and the
                            party itself may lose much of the esprit that characterized the
                            revolutionary period.</p>

                        <p>95. During the past five years the relationship between Communist China
                            and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has become a concert of
                            interest and action in which a substantial degree of mutual dependence
                            has developed. The two allies are linked not only by ideological bonds,
                            but by common hostility to the US, by a military interdependence
                            involving <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0274"/>Communist China’s
                            manpower and strategic location and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>’s industrial and technical capabilities, and by the
                            mutual advantages of concerted diplomatic and “revolutionary”
                            activities. While we believe that policies of mutual concern are
                            mutually determined, Peiping’s dependence on Moscow for arms, industrial
                            resources, and technical assistance will cause it to continue to give
                            Moscow’s views great weight on major questions of global policy. But
                            Peiping’s tactical position in many areas probably gives it considerable
                            potential for influencing Moscow.</p>
                        <p>96. From the beginning, the Chinese Communist regime escaped Satellite
                            status both because of the size and remoteness of China and because the
                            regime rose to power primarily through its own efforts. The Communist
                            Chinese role in the Korean War gave Communist China additional
                            bargaining strength in dealing with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>97. Since late 1950 Soviet writers have accorded <persName
                                corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> special honor for his contributions
                            to the “treasury of Marxism-Leninism” in the field of strategy and
                            tactics for revolutions in “colonial and semicolonial” countries. There
                            were indications in the late summer of 1954 of unusual Soviet
                            solicitousness towards the Chinese Communists in Malenkov’s public
                            reference to the “new situation in Asia” created by the emergence of
                            Communist China, and in the unprecedented visit to Peiping of <persName

                            the Bloc was further enhanced by <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName>’s subsequent reference in February 1955 to the
                            “world camp of socialism and democracy” as “headed by the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>—or more correctly said—headed by the

                        <p>98. Traditional Sino-Russian territorial rivalries along their 1,400-mile
                            common border are a potential source of friction between the allies.
                            Since the 18th century, China has regarded Tannu Tuva and Outer Mongolia
                            as Chinese territory. Although the Chinese Communists now appear to have
                            accepted Soviet control of these areas, they may still be apprehensive
                            about Soviet influence in Sin-kiang and possibly about the recent Soviet
                            interest in developing previously neglected regions adjacent to Sinkiang
                            and Manchuria. However, the well-publicized Soviet withdrawal from
                            Dairen and Port Arthur indicates that the Soviet leadership has taken
                            steps to reduce Chinese Communist sensitivity in the border areas.</p>
                        <p>99. Sino-Soviet economic relations are another area of potential
                            friction. There have probably been disagreements over the level of
                            Soviet aid to Communist China’s industrialization, and the Chinese
                            Communists have almost certainly pressed for much greater aid than the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is willing to grant.</p>
                        <p>100. Although there is no evidence of serious friction or lack of
                            coordination in Chinese Communist and Soviet relations with other
                            Communist parties in Asia, there is a latent possibility of strains
                            developing <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0275"/>in these relations.
                            In North Korea the Chinese Communists increased their influence during
                            the Korean War, but Soviet-trained figures still hold the most important
                            positions. In North Vietnam, geographic proximity has fostered Chinese
                            Communist influence, and the volume of Chinese Communist propaganda
                            support and projected aid exceeds that of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. Chinese Communist influence on Japanese Communism may
                            also have increased with the recent return of some Japanese Communist
                            leaders from Communist China. The Chinese Communists apparently control
                            the Malayan Communist Party, but their influence on the Indonesian
                            Communist Party may be offset by long established channels leading to
                            Moscow.</p>
                        <p>101. The intensity of the “liberate Taiwan” movement in Communist China
                            on a number of occasions may have created apprehensions among Soviet
                            leaders. Chinese Communist willingness since the Bandung Conference to
                            use diplomatic tactics to further their objectives in Taiwan probably
                            indicates that this possible difference of emphasis is not now a serious
                            source of Sino-Soviet friction.</p>
                        <p>102. During the period of this estimate, Communist China’s power and its
                            potential for pursuing courses of action which could conflict with
                            Soviet interests or desires will probably increase. Communist China will
                            probably exert an increasing influence on Asian opinion independent of
                            that exercised by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The growth
                            in Chinese Communist prestige might encourage some Chinese Communist
                            leaders to attempt to extend Chinese influence over other Asian
                            Communist parties beyond the point desired by the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. However, no major differences of
                            interest in Asia seem likely to develop during the period of this
                            estimate.</p>
                        <p>103. For a considerable time to come mutual advantage, the existence of
                            common enemies, and a single ideology will almost certainly prevail over
                            lesser considerations to preserve close Sino-Soviet ties which will
                            probably continue to be relatively impervious to outside manipulation.
                            Peiping probably believes that its alliance with the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> prevented <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> forces from broadening the Korean War and restrains the
                            US from action against the mainland. The Chinese Communists will almost
                            certainly feel the need for continued protection until their own power
                            in the Far East is much further developed.</p>
                        <p>104. Therefore, at least through 1960, Peiping will almost certainly
                            adhere to the alliance. A lessening of East-West tensions would probably
                            not significantly affect Peiping’s estimate of the continued need for
                            the alliance, and might ease pressure in Sino-Soviet economic and
                            military negotiations. A heightening of tensions could create new
                            problems for the alliance, but would strengthen Peiping’s desire for
                            solidarity, unless the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> proved
                            unwilling to insure the security of the Peiping regime.</p>

                                Courses of Action in Asia</hi></p>
                        <p>105. In pursuit of its basic foreign policy aims, Peiping will, during
                            the next five years, probably concentrate on eliminating the Nationalist
                            government and gaining control of all Nationalist-held territory,
                            eliminating Western (and especially US) influence and power in Asia,
                            extending its own influence in the area, and achieving acceptance as the
                            legitimate government of China. The Chinese Communists probably believe
                            that time is on their side. This conviction is based on a belief both in
                            the ultimate victory of the world Communist movement and in the power of
                            China under strong central government. Leninist doctrine and their own
                            interpretation of recent events have probably convinced them that
                            flexibility and even tactical retreats will not seriously compromise
                            their long term prospects.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chinese Communist Estimate of the
                            Situation</hi></p>
                        <p>106. The primary factor in determining the manner in which Peiping will
                            pursue its foreign policy objectives is its estimate of probable US
                            actions and reactions. It probably considers the ultimate US objective
                            in Asia to be the elimination of the Chinese Communist regime, but
                            probably estimates that the US does not intend, unprovoked, to attack
                            Communist China within the next several years.</p>
                        <p>107. Peiping almost certainly estimates that open aggression on its part
                            against either Taiwan or the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would
                            lead to strong US counteraction, probably including action against
                            mainland China and possibly including the use of nuclear weapons. It
                            probably further estimates that an overt Chinese Communist attack on any
                            other non-Communist Asian state would also entail risk of US military
                            counteraction against the China mainland. It probably also estimates
                            that an overt attack by the Viet Minh against any of the Indochinese
                            states might result in at least local US military reaction, with such
                            reaction particularly likely in the case of South Vietnam. The Chinese
                            Communists probably also estimate that US military capabilities for the
                            concentration and effective application of force in the areas of Korea,
                            Taiwan, Indochina, and even the China mainland are still superior to
                            their own. However, there almost certainly remain twilight areas in
                            which they are uncertain as to the intention or the ability of the US to
                            react, as in the event of attacks on the Nationalist offshore islands or
                            intensified subversive efforts in non-Communist states.</p>
                        <p>108. Moreover, the Chinese Communists probably estimate that they have
                            certain advantages over the US in any primarily political struggle in
                            Asia. They almost certainly believe that the prestige of Communist China
                            in Asia will increase along with the military and economic strength of
                            their regime. They probably estimate that the <pb n="249"
                                xml:id="pg_249" facs="0277"/>indigenous Communist parties and, to a
                            lesser extent, the 12,000,000 overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia provide
                            them with unique instruments for undermining non-Communist governments.
                            In their view differences among the non-Communist powers on Asian policy
                            will make it difficult for the US to take effective measures against
                            Communist expansion conducted through measures short of overt
                            aggression. Moreover, they probably estimate that anti-colonial,
                            neutralist, and nationalist sentiment will continue to aid their efforts
                            to discredit US motives in Asia. They probably also estimate that
                            American diplomacy is complicated by commitments in other areas and by
                            external and internal political pressures which make it less flexible
                            than their own.</p>
                        <p>109. At the same time, the Chinese Communists may recognize that serious
                            obstacles exist to the extension of their power: (a) in most
                            non-Communist states in Asia, nationalism is the dominant force and most
                            leaders of these states recognize the threat of a domestic Communist
                            movement to their independence; (b) despite occasional well-publicized
                            offers of technical and material aid, Chinese Communist capital
                            resources are insufficient to help these countries gratify their desires
                            for industrial development; and (c) less importantly, in several of
                            these same countries, the influential local Chinese community is still
                            regarded with envy and suspicion.</p>
                        <p>110. The Chinese Communists are probably not as concerned with the
                            present strength of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> as with the
                            future possibility of an expanded and strengthened anti-Communist bloc
                            in Asia. Their apprehensions on this score probably center on Japan, in
                            their view the only Asian power which might significantly augment
                            anti-Communist power in Asia during the period of this estimate. The
                            Chinese Communists probably also view India as a rival for Asian
                            leadership. They probably also estimate that India would resent a
                            substantial extension of Communist influence in South and Southeast Asia
                            and be alienated by overt Chinese Communist aggression in these areas.
                            Peiping apparently feels that an attitude of outward respect for the
                            positions of Japan, India, and other Asian powers will encourage their
                            passivity and a tendency to think in terms of Asian solidarity. It
                            appears to believe that such ostentatious maneuvers as mutual
                            declarations of fealty to “the five principles”<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d126fn7">The “five principles,” first subscribed to by

                                nonaggression, noninterference in each other’s internal affairs,
                                equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.” Although

                                >Nehru</persName>’s insistence, the principles are standard
                                Communist cliches, closely resembling those used in Soviet treaties
                                both with Nationalist China in 1945 and with Communist China in
                                1950. Since mid-1954, the principles have been major slogans of
                                Peking diplomacy and have been subscribed to by <persName

                            motives.</p>
                        <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0278"/>
                        <p>111. In Communist China’s view the probable basic hostility of France,
                            the Netherlands, Portugal, and probably even the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> is unlikely to be effectively manifested because of
                            their political and military weaknesses and, to a lesser degree, because
                            of their desire for trade with Communist China. Chinese Communist
                            hostility to these countries has therefore been subordinated to
                            hostility to the US. The Chinese Communist regime probably estimates
                            that so long as it exercises restraint toward these countries, they can
                            be of considerable value to it, both in trade and in inducing the US to
                            modify its policies in the Far East.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Main Lines of Chinese Communist Foreign Policy</hi></p>
                        <p>112. During the period of this estimate, Peiping will almost certainly
                            wish to avoid serious military involvement with the US. For this reason,
                            we believe that Peiping is unlikely to initiate open hostilities with
                            its own forces, except perhaps against the offshore islands. Peiping
                            probably would also be unlikely to encourage the North Koreans or the
                            Viet Minh to undertake large-scale military action because it would
                            probably estimate that such action could not be carried out without
                            ultimate large-scale involvement of Communist China with the US.
                            However, during the period Peiping will probably encourage expanded
                            guerrilla activity in Indochina. Although Peiping will probably continue
                            to sanction other guerrilla movements now in existence it is unlikely,
                            at least in the early part of the period, to provide the support
                            necessary for large-scale expansion of these activities.</p>
                        <p>113. Although the Communists may again resort to military action whenever
                            they estimate that the benefits will outweigh the military disadvantages
                            of such action, Peiping will continue to pursue policies emphasizing
                            political rather than military action as long as its objectives are
                            acceptably served by this means. The major factor in this consideration
                            will be their estimate of the risk of US military counteraction; thus
                            Communist China will probably emphasize political action over the next
                            two or three years. In collaboration with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, Communist China will pursue a policy of “competitive
                            coexistence with the capitalist bloc.” The Chinese Communists will
                            endeavor to have their approach to international problems characterized
                            as conciliatory and flexible, but joint Sino-Soviet policy will in fact
                            permit no major concessions to the West. Moreover, both parties may feel
                            that the development of occasional crisis situations would weaken the
                            diplomatic position of the US and strengthen neutralism, without
                            seriously prejudicing their own “coexistence” posture. Communist <pb
                                n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0279"/>China will also be under some
                            pressure, more so than the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, to
                            manufacture crises in its external affairs to provide a pretext for
                            imposing new production and austerity drives at home. For these reasons,
                            we believe that although Peiping will continue to profess support for
                            the “five principles” there will be times when it will assert its power
                            ostentatiously, but within the general limits of Bloc strategy, in order
                            to reaffirm its particular claims and pretensions.</p>
                        <p>114. By 1960, if Communist China follows a course of political rather
                            than military action, most non-Communist countries will probably have
                            recognized Peiping and established normal economic relations with
                            Communist China, and it will probably have been accepted into the
                            community of nations as the major Asian power. In this situation, its
                            position in the Sino-Soviet Bloc will have been enhanced and the Chinese
                            Communists will probably have a greater degree of flexibility in their
                            relationship with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>115. Peiping’s diplomatic activities on behalf of the Bloc policy of
                            “competitive coexistence” will be concentrated in Asia and the Middle
                            East, where there is a disposition to accept Communist China as a
                            “former victim of imperialist and capitalist oppression.” Communist
                            China’s role in this effort will be to play up to neutralist and
                            nationalist sentiment in Asia; to manipulate the Indochina and Taiwan
                            issues to divide the West; and to exploit vulnerable aspects of
                            intra-Asian relations such as <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                            >ROK</gloss>-Japanese and Indian-Pakistani tensions. The Chinese
                            Communists will almost certainly continue their efforts to discredit US
                            actions and motives throughout Asia, insisting that US policy is
                            disguised colonialism and is directed toward a war in which “Asians will
                            be used to fight Asians.” In particular, they will attempt to frustrate
                            US efforts to develop a basis for military cooperation among free Asian
                            states. Peiping will emphasize the advantages of technical and economic
                            assistance from Communist countries as well as “mutual self-help” among
                            underdeveloped countries. They will also seek a reduction in Western
                            military, commercial, and other privileges in the area. Chinese
                            Communist propaganda on these themes will seek primarily to keep
                            anti-Communist Asians on the defensive over the issues of “colonialism”
                            while the base for future Communist advances is strengthened. Communist
                            China will encourage wherever possible the formation of popular-front
                            type governments in which the Communist influence would be significant
                            and the Chinese Communist pattern of anticolonial “people’s democracy”
                            studied and admired. While to the US Peiping policy may appear
                            uncompromising, to many Asian states it may appear conciliatory and
                            flexible.</p>
                        <p>116. The possibility of a Communist-initiated war in the Taiwan Straits,
                            Vietnam, Laos, and even Korea will continue to exist. Moreover, Peiping
                            would almost certainly react with force if Communist <pb n="252"
                                xml:id="pg_252" facs="0280"/>control of North Korea or North Vietnam
                            were seriously threatened. They would almost certainly retaliate to any
                            sharp increase in the level of Nationalist attacks against the
                            mainland.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Specific Courses of Action</hi></p>
                        <p>117. <hi rend="italic">Taiwan</hi>. Peiping is committed to the
                            “liberation” of all Nationalist-held territory, and defines the Taiwan
                            issue as an internal one in which foreign interference will not be
                            tolerated. For the period of this estimate, however, Chinese Communist
                            courses of action toward the offshore islands and Taiwan will be
                            determined largely by their estimate of US reactions.</p>
                        <p>118. Since the Bandung Conference in April 1955, the Chinese Communists
                            have attempted to advance their claims to Nationalist-held territories
                            more by diplomacy than by military action. However, Peiping has
                            emphasized that its current willingness to take over Taiwan “peacefully,
                            if possible,” should not be interpreted as an abandonment of its basic
                            objective. Chinese Communist efforts will be concentrated on reducing
                            morale within the Chinese National government and within the mainland
                            Chinese community on Taiwan, in the expectation that Nationalist leaders
                            may ultimately be induced to negotiate with Peiping over Taiwan’s
                            assimilation into Communist China. The Chinese Communists will also
                            continue trying to force US agreement to a bilateral or multilateral
                            conference, at which their object would be to induce the removal of US
                            military protection from Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>119. The Chinese Communists will probably continue their buildup in the
                            area opposite Taiwan and the offshore islands in order to increase
                            pressure on the US and to weaken morale on Taiwan. While the Chinese
                            Communists probably do not intend to attack Taiwan so long as the US
                            maintains its commitments to the Nationalists, they will almost
                            certainly conduct probing operations against the offshore islands. If
                            the Chinese became convinced that the US would not assist in the defense
                            of these islands with its own forces, they probably would attempt to
                            seize them. Should Peiping’s forces successfully occupy the
                            Nationalist-held offshore islands without incurring US military
                            retaliation, there would be an intensification of the campaign to obtain
                            Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>120. <hi rend="italic">Indochina</hi>. We believe that the immediate
                            Chinese Communist objective in Indochina was secured at Geneva when the
                            Viet Minh were granted full control of North Vietnam. Peiping may have
                            believed that it also received an implied commitment for the delivery of
                            South Vietnam in July 1956, and that in any event conditions had been
                            created which would make it difficult for the US to intervene. However,
                            we believe that the Chinese Communists now estimate <pb n="253"
                                xml:id="pg_253" facs="0281"/>that the US would make a strong effort
                            to frustrate an extension of Communist control to the south.</p>
                        <p>121. In conjunction with the Hanoi regime, Peiping will continue its
                            efforts to expand Communist influence and control in South Vietnam.
                            Through coercion, subversion, and propaganda the two Communist regimes
                            will attempt to discredit and undermine the authority of the Diem
                            government, and to embarrass that government and the US on the question
                            of nationwide elections. In addition, the Chinese Communists will
                            continue diplomatic efforts to isolate the Diem government from the
                            Western nations and the Asian neutrals. Even if the Viet Minh are
                            delayed in achieving a settlement, by elections or otherwise, favorable
                            to the extension of their control over all of Vietnam, the Chinese
                            Communists probably will not encourage the Viet Minh to renew open
                            hostilities. However, at some point they probably will encourage
                            increased Viet Minh guerrilla activity in South Vietnam. Their actions
                            beyond that phase would probably depend on the effectiveness of Diem’s
                            counteraction and the response of the US and the <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> powers.</p>
                        <p>122. In Cambodia and Laos, the Chinese Communists will combine pressure
                            and inducements to encourage neutralist sentiment, to weaken ties with
                            the West, and to stimulate subversion of the free governments. We
                            believe that if the Pathet Lao position were threatened by Royal
                            Government action, Peiping would encourage the Viet Minh to assist the
                            Pathet Lao to the extent necessary to preserve the Pathet position. It
                            is less likely that the Chinese Communists will encourage the Pathet Lao
                            to undertake aggressive military action outside of their present
                            groupment area, at least while the International Control Commission
                            remains in being and in the absence of greater evidence of popular
                            support for the Pathet Lao within Laos. Should South Vietnam fall to the
                            Viet Minh, Communist support for subversion and paramilitary operations
                            in Laos and Cambodia would almost certainly be increased.</p>
                        <p>123. <hi rend="italic">Korea</hi>. The Chinese Communists, in common with
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, hope to secure a withdrawal
                            of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces from Korea and a reduction
                            of US influence there and eventually to subvert the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. As a means of putting pressure on the
                            US to withdraw its troops, the Bloc will probably urge new negotiations
                            on unification and “relaxation of tensions.” To further this end, there
                            may be additional withdrawals of Chinese Communist forces. The
                            Communists will almost certainly refuse any settlement in Korea which
                            endangers Communist control of North Korea or fails to offer better
                            prospects than at present for eventual Communist control of all
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>124. <hi rend="italic">Japan</hi>. Communist China seeks to forestall the
                            re-emergence of Japan as a major military and political power in Asia
                            and, in the short run, to weaken Japan’s links with the US by exploiting
                            US-Japanese <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0282"/>policy difference.
                            Peiping’s tactics will probably continue to rely upon the manipulation
                            of domestic opposition to the policies of the Japanese conservatives,
                            the inducements of Sino-Japanese trade, and the application of direct
                            pressures upon the Japanese government. Communist China will probably be
                            able to increase semiofficial contact with Japan through trade and
                            cultural missions and will probably step up its campaign to normalize
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>125. Communist China will probably continue to support the current line
                            of the Japanese Communist Party in avoiding acts of violence and working
                            for a popular front. However, should any Japanese government undertake
                            an extensive rearmament program or reverse the present policy of
                            permitting the expansion of unofficial relations with Peiping, Communist
                            China might publicly revert to the position that Japan is a major threat
                            to peace and launch a campaign of threats and intimidation designed to
                            reinforce leftist opposition within Japan.</p>
                        <p>126. <hi rend="italic">India</hi>. Although Communist China almost
                            certainly regards India as a rival, it will, at least during the next
                            two or three years, probably seek to encourage India’s present
                            neutralist stand, which has furthered the aims of Sino-Soviet diplomacy
                            by bolstering neutralist sentiment generally throughout Asia and the
                            Middle East. Thus, Communist China will stress those interests it shares
                            with India, and will probably keep its attempts to expand its influence
                            in the Indo-Tibetan border area just short of the point where the Indian
                            government’s antagonism could no longer be concealed.</p>
                        <p>127. <hi rend="italic">Burma</hi>. In the next two or three years it will
                            probably be Peiping’s minimum objective to prevent Burma from abandoning
                            its present neutral position. Beyond that, Communist China will be
                            working to distort Burma’s neutrality, by encouraging tighter Burmese
                            bonds with Communist nations. The threat of its military power will
                            continue to reinforce Communist China’s diplomatic campaign emphasizing
                            offers of friendship and peaceful cooperation. Peiping will almost
                            certainly attempt to exploit Burma’s financial and economic problems to
                            bring about closer Burmese-Chinese Communist ties. Moreover, the Chinese
                            Communists will retain their capabilities for subverting the minority
                            peoples along Burma’s eastern frontier.</p>
                        <p>128. <hi rend="italic">Indonesia</hi>. The Indonesian Communist Party
                            (PKI) is the strongest indigenous Communist party in non-Communist Asia
                            and the Chinese Communists probably estimate that its capabilities will
                            continue to be maximized by emphasizing a “peaceful” attitude toward the
                            Indonesian government. Communist China will probably continue its
                            efforts to enhance the chances of PKI participation in a national front
                            government by itself appearing to support Indonesian nationalist
                            objectives. Even if the PKI were excluded from the new <pb n="255"
                                xml:id="pg_255" facs="0283"/>government which will come into office
                            in the spring of 1956, the Indonesian Communists would probably be
                            encouraged by the Chinese Communists to continue working for a popular
                            front primarily by penetration, propaganda, and organizational work.</p>
                        <p>129. <hi rend="italic">Malaya</hi>. Communist China probably hopes, by
                            encouraging Malayan nationalism, to force a British withdrawal from
                            Malaya under conditions that would increase local Communist prestige.
                            Peiping probably estimates that its capability to achieve this end is
                            enhanced by the continued colonial status of the area, and in Singapore
                            by the predominant overseas Chinese population. Peiping will almost
                            certainly continue to encourage Malayan Communists to work for popular
                            front governments, to extend control over Chinese youth and the labor
                            movement, and to maintain their guerrilla organization.</p>

                            views be transmitted to Department. He regarded US as loyal friend and
                            supporter of free nations of Asia adding that US policy should be their
                            policy. Then without mentioning <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> or

                            appeasement. He hoped and believed US would stand fast; otherwise Asian
                            countries would be forced to follow independent policies of their
                            own.</p>

                                    needed. So there is no reason to expect any new departure in

                            by saying he had listened my statement this morning in which I had
                            reviewed course discussion on Item Two. He had listened very carefully
                            but could not hear anything new or constructive in statement.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said this applies in
                            particular to my remarks which discussed his draft of December 1. He
                            recalled that when he introduced December 1 draft, I had expressed
                            welcome and had said it represented considerable advance in discussions.
                            We have had prolonged discussion this matter of issuing announcement on
                            this question.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said he had glanced over
                            amended draft I had presented this morning<note n="3" xml:id="d129fn3"
                                >See <ref target="#d128fn7">footnote 7, <hi rend="italic"

                            wording and language, he noted that question of principle still remains.
                            He noted I was again claiming alleged right of so-called individual and
                            collective self-defense in Taiwan area.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said US is today occupying
                            island of Taiwan which Chinese territory. Under these circumstances US
                            has absolutely no right speak of any self-defense in Taiwan area.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said in my statement this
                            morning I had made reference to fact US is member of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and also made reference to number
                            international treaties and pacts, but all this could not defend position
                            of US in occupying territory of other countries. If US could claim right
                            to self-defense in Taiwan area, <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName> could say there is no more justice in world.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said his side has long
                            expressed itself unmistakably on this matter, that it would never accept
                            this position. Therefore he said that amendments presented by me at
                            today’s meeting unreasonable and unacceptable to his side. Such
                            amendments as had been put forward this morning would not help in any
                            way in settlement of matter before us. Nor would they help bring closer
                            views of two sides.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said I might recall that
                            during discussion of second item it was US which initiated proposal of
                            making announcement on renunciation source. <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> side has repeatedly met views of US side and <pb
                                n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0288"/>put forward new draft of
                            December 1. Thus it could be said <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                            side has moved several steps forward on this matter.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said in this draft of
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> side it clearly stated that on
                            basis of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter, both sides should
                            settle disputes between them by peaceful means without resorting to
                            threat or use force. This not only conforms with desire of people of our
                            two countries but also conforms with the desires of peaceloving peoples
                            of world.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said however for three
                            meetings in succession US side has failed make any comments on his draft
                            and fact that after long recess US side should suggest such terms and
                            wording as had long been categorically rejected by <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> side could not but cause doubt as to
                            whether US side has sincere desire arrive at agreement.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said at same time he
                            wanted point out that recently American military aircraft have been
                            making encroachment on their territorial air and American “top brass”
                            have gone to Taiwan to step up military preparations. All this
                            conclusively proves that US bent on increasing tension in Taiwan
                            area.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said further, according
                            press reports, US Air Force Secretary <persName>Quarles</persName> has
                            gone so far as to indicate that outlying islands around Taiwan are
                            American bases in Far East.<note n="4" xml:id="d129fn4">The <hi
                                    rend="italic">New York Times</hi> of January 8, 1956, quoted
                                Quarles as saying, in response to a question whether he thought the
                                Communists would attack the Nationalist-held offshore islands, that
                                they must recognize that the islands were “part of a global
                                position” and that it would be “most unwise” of them to risk an
                                attack.</note> Thus it apparent that it intention of US side to

                            of American occupation Taiwan as well as coastal islands controlled by
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> clique. This
                            position of US side can never be tolerated by <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> side.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said all these events
                            cannot but alarm <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> side and create
                            doubts among Chinese as to whether US side is genuinely sincere in
                            stated desire settle disputes between two countries.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said, in view of fact that
                            US is creating tension and in view of attitude of US side in
                            deliberately stalling talks, all of which not in conformity with purpose
                            and aims these talks, therefore <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> side
                            demands that these meetings be public so that issues may be judged by
                            world opinion. Also <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> side is obliged
                            give account to Chinese people of proceedings these talks. That was
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> side’s opinion on question we
                            had just discussed.</p>
                        <p>14. I said in reply that first I didn’t believe they’d had sufficient
                            time fully consider my suggested changes and that I hoped they would do
                            so. I thought probably first question between US, often discussed here,
                            is question of whether we considered statement applied to Taiwan area.
                            My suggestion from beginning on October 8 was that we make this
                            specifically clear.</p>
                        <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0289"/>
                        <p>15. I said my understanding of their position had always been that they
                            would consider such statement as applicable to Taiwan area. However,
                            they had objected to form in which it was previously made on grounds
                            this would prejudice their position on Taiwan area.</p>
                        <p>16. I said that I had stated in as many ways as I possibly could that our
                            intention was not to get them to say anything that would prejudice
                            pursuit of their policies by peaceful means, that this was made clear in
                            our October 8 statement and our November 10 draft, but that they had
                            objected to form in which it was set forth in that draft.</p>
                        <p>17. I said we were both agreed that most serious problem facing our two
                            sides was precisely in Taiwan area, and that question therefore appeared
                            to me to be not whether any agreement applied to Taiwan area but whether
                            it clearly stated this.</p>
                        <p>18. I said that they had talked previously, and at great length this
                            morning, of sincerity, I said my government had over and over proposed
                            and I again proposed this morning that both sides sincerity be
                            demonstrated by specifically relating our agreement to Taiwan area. This
                            would assure world which as he had rightly said had longed for peace,
                            that neither side had any concealed reservations in this regard.</p>
                        <p>19. I said I had over and over pointed out problem wasn’t one of form of
                            words which either side variously interprets, but lay in reaching
                            genuine agreement which could be put into words. To do otherwise
                            certainly could not contribute to peace. I was reluctant to place
                            interpretation that might well be placed on their adamant refusal to
                            permit any mention of Taiwan area.</p>
                        <p>20. I then said in regard to second point—mention of individual and
                            collective self-defense—I would have considered they would have regarded
                            it as important as we did. It was my understanding their government did
                            not deny right of individual and collective self-defense to itself or to
                            any other country. My understanding had been that their side objected to
                            form of our November 10 draft because they felt it prejudiced their
                            position on Taiwan area. Again, in honest effort to meet their point on
                            this, in this draft we had tried to introduce this idea in form that
                            would not do so.</p>
                        <p>21. I suggested that we go over exactly what that second para said. What
                            it said was we were determined to settle our disputes by peaceful means
                            and that certainly neither of us objected to that. Then it said we would
                            not resort to force in Taiwan area nor elsewhere. This was certainly
                            clear and specific and I could not see why there could be any objection
                            to that language. It then said that in stating this principle both sides
                            wished to make it clear it was without prejudice to right of individual
                            and collective self-defense. This <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262"
                                facs="0290"/>was stated as general principle and I could not see
                            what possible objection there could be to its inclusion in draft.</p>
                        <p>22. I said this second para as presently drafted would go as far as words
                            could to show there was understanding between us. That if there was
                            objection as to wording that revealed understanding between us was not
                            as clear as I had thought.</p>
                        <p>23. I said they [<hi rend="italic">we</hi>?] again this morning had
                            discussed our dispute in Taiwan area and certainly our first task was to
                            make certain this dispute did not lead to hostilities. If threat of
                            force was clearly removed from that dispute, there was hope questions
                            between us could, in that atmosphere, be discussed and resolved. I said
                            draft I had proposed this morning should accomplish this purpose and I
                            had hoped they would give it further study in light of my remarks.</p>
                        <p>24. I said I was not exactly clear about what they meant by their
                            proposal to make our meetings open. I understood that in normal
                            international usage, “open” meant public would attend our meetings. Or
                            was their proposal that at close of each meeting press would be given
                            full account of meeting by each of us.</p>
                        <p>25. I said in either event it was difficult for me to see how this could
                            contribute to progress of our discussions. It seemed to me in either of
                            these events, it would tend to make our meetings platforms from which
                            each would speak to his public, rather than place for our negotiating
                            and reaching understanding.</p>
                        <p>26. I said I was certainly willing that our respective positions be laid
                            before public. I was certainly willing that public be informed of their
                            categorical and sweeping rejection of any mention of Taiwan area in any
                            statement of agreement growing out of our discussions. I was sure public
                            would have difficulty in understanding that in three months which had
                            passed since we had made our proposal, their government was still
                            unwilling to make it clear it did not have concealed reservations on
                            Taiwan area in any statement on renunciation of force.</p>
                        <p>27. I said that however, I didn’t see how all of this would contribute to
                            our making further progress in our discussion and if this was attitude
                            of their government, I wondered whether it really desired that we make
                            progress. As I as well as my government was interested in making
                            progress, I was unable to agree that we abrogate our agreement that
                            nature of these meetings be private, and I was unable to agree either
                            that meetings be open to public or press be informed substance each
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>28. I said I still felt interests and relations between two of us and
                            cause of peace could best be served by keeping our discussions on frank
                            open level that was possible under present arrangement and by informing
                            general public of our agreements when we had reached <pb n="263"
                                xml:id="pg_263" facs="0291"/>them, rather than by informing the
                            world of our disagreements as they came up here.</p>
                        <p>29. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said that other side had
                            just asserted that Chinese side had not had sufficient time to study
                            draft presented by US side. As to ideas US side has brought up, Chinese
                            side had always been willing to give full consideration to those which
                            were constructive, but he had to say that draft presented today did not
                            contain anything new or constructive. All those amendments AS [<hi
                                rend="italic">US</hi>] side had presented that morning had been
                            subject to long and tedious discussions, and during course of these
                            Chinese side had on many occasions expressed its firm opposition.</p>
                        <p>30. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said he was sure US
                            Ambassador was fully acquainted with course of discussions, in which it
                            could be seen clearly how far Chinese side had moved and how the US side
                            still stuck to its original position without making any progress. Views
                            presented by US side had repeatedly been rejected by Chinese side, yet
                            they have again been advanced, and Chinese side could not give
                            consideration to them.</p>
                        <p>31. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said that in particular,
                            he noted that US side had again advanced point concerning individual and
                            collective self-defense. Naturally, it was a matter of principle that
                            every state was entitled to right of self-defense and Chinese were
                            prepared to recognize this. However, question was as to where it was to
                            be applied, because there can be no objection if US exercises this right
                            on its own territory.</p>
                        <p>32. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said that if, on other
                            hand, it were on territory of another country, then certainly it could
                            lay no claims to self-defense. When Japan in 1937 began its aggression
                            against China, she also claimed this action was in self-defense.
                            However, no people in world then recognized that as such and none could
                            be persuaded that Japan’s action was taken in self-defense. Therefore,
                            there should be a clear definition and understanding as to this word
                            self-defense and this word must not be arbitrarily abused.</p>
                        <p>33. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said that as to question
                            US side had raised regarding whether peaceful solution of disputes
                            between our two countries applied to Taiwan area, as he had repeatedly
                            declared this did concern Taiwan area. The peaceful solution of disputes
                            between two countries also applied to Taiwan area.</p>
                        <p>34. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said as to openness of
                            meetings: it was not meant that public would be admitted to this
                            conference room. But he meant the content of our discussion be released
                            to press. Hence, as US side clearly recalled, at outset of talks he had
                            followed US suggestion that these talks should be held private and this
                            arrangement have no set time limit. The Chinese side throughout has
                            observed these two rules <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0292"/>in
                            hope that it would permit full exchange of views, frankly, and would
                            settle issues between us, and finally reach agreements.</p>
                        <p>35. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said Chinese side felt
                            these rules had been useful to our discussion in initial stages, and
                            facts showed that after forty days discussion we did reach our first
                            agreement on the return of civilians. That also showed there was common
                            desire between two sides to arrive at agreement and Chinese had
                            expressed their welcome to such a spirit. Thus it showed that provided
                            both sides shared a common desire to solve their common issues, these
                            issues would be capable of resolution. For example, last September
                            between Soviet Union and German Federal Republic. As we knew, relations
                            were rather tense; however, after one week’s discussion they did arrive
                            at an agreement<note n="5" xml:id="d129fn5">Reference is to an agreement
                                to establish diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the
                                German Federal Republic which the two countries reached during talks
                                held in Moscow September 9–13 between delegations headed by Premier
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BMNA1">Bulganin</persName> and Chancellor
                                Adenauer. The text of the communiqué issued in Moscow on September
                                13 is in <hi rend="italic">Documents on International Affairs,
                                    1955</hi>, pp. 251–253.</note> simply because of their common
                            desire to reach an agreement, and hence there were favorable
                            results.</p>
                        <p>36. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said that since last
                            September 14 we had begun to discuss Item Two. It was now four months.
                            This was not a short time. If there did exist common desire between two
                            sides to settle issues between them, he should say that the two would
                            have been able to reach many agreements instead of only one agreement.
                            However, after four months both still found themselves deadlocked in the
                            same place, and found themselves incapable of agreeing on simple
                            announcement after all this time.</p>
                        <p>37. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said questions between us
                            not only concern peoples of our two countries but also concern people of
                            whole world. They, however, are not informed about our talks and of what
                            has taken place. Now people ask why after such long time discussion, you
                            people have obtained no result. As to Chinese side, they have always
                            wanted an agreement to be reached between two so that Chinese government
                            could make account to its people as to what had happened. We have wasted
                            lots of time. Chinese side considers there has been deliberate stalling
                            in talks. This is why Chinese side suggested we make meetings open: so
                            that people will realize what issues between us are. That is what
                            Chinese side considers responsible attitude toward people.</p>
                        <p>38. I said he had said that if we shared common desire to reach agreement
                            we should be able to do so. I most thoroughly agreed. That is what I had
                            been trying to find out.</p>
                        <p>39. I said clear back on October 8 I had said that US was willing to make
                            declaration that we were determined our differences should not lead to
                            war. I made it clear that US was desirous and willing, in <pb n="265"
                                xml:id="pg_265" facs="0293"/>order that there be no misunderstanding
                            between us or in world, that this would specifically apply to area in
                            which our most serious dispute existed, that is area of Taiwan. I made
                            it clear this did not involve in any way and it was not intention US in
                            these talks involve rights and interests third parties. Nor was there
                            any intention to prejudice peaceful pursuit of our several national
                            policies. Yet after three months their government still unwilling
                            publicly to make such statement. It was difficult to understand why, if
                            Chinese considered that such statement applied to Taiwan area, as he had
                            stated, why he would be unwilling to do so.</p>
                        <p>40. I said I did not agree that we had not made progress—I believed we
                            had made some. I believed discussions had been useful. Insofar as
                            responsibility for failure thus far to agree on text of announcement on
                            renunciation of force—it is very clear.</p>
                        <p>41. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said US side had remarked
                            that our exchange views had been useful, but he did not see how it had
                            been useful. If it were really useful, it should have been demonstrated
                            in progress toward solution of issues between us.</p>
                        <p>42. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said as to wording of
                            text, if phrase concerning right to individual and collective
                            self-defense could be removed, then Chinese side could give
                            consideration to mention of Taiwan area. However, if we fail reach
                            agreement on text of declaration, responsibility squarely on US
                            side.</p>
                        <p>43. I asked if he objected to principle of individual and collective
                            self-defense.</p>
                        <p>44. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said that principle was
                            all right but could not apply to Taiwan area. US attempting to exercise
                            this right in Taiwan area would be abuse.</p>
                        <p>45. I asked if he intended to tell United States in what countries it
                            could have arrangements for individual and collective self-defense. As I
                            understood it, their country had individual and collective self-defense
                            arrangements with other countries but I had never raised question
                            here.</p>
                        <p>46. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said they had such
                            arrangements but they had them on their own territory and they had never
                            gone thousands of miles across sea to US. Suppose Chinese had military
                            strength to occupy San Francisco and then clamored about self-defense.
                            Could US consent to this?</p>
                        <p>47. I asked whether I could understand that they had no objection to
                            principle but felt its mention in this context prejudiced their position
                            in dispute between us in Taiwan area.</p>
                        <p>48. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said it was not thus.
                            Chinese agree that every country has this right of self-defense, but
                            question is not that this prejudices their position but that US has no
                            right to claim self-defense in <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0294"
                            />Taiwan area. And in exactly same manner China has no right to set foot
                            on San Francisco and claim self-defense.</p>
                        <p>49. I said that I did not believe he had gotten point of my question.
                            Question of validity of our defense arrangements in Taiwan area was
                            matter of dispute between us. Chinese govt had one view, my government
                            had another. I did not purpose [<hi rend="italic">propose</hi>?] to
                            discuss or try to resolve this problem with him. That was element in
                            differences of views we had respecting Taiwan area. As I had told him, I
                            had no intention demanding any statement from them that would prejudice
                            their view in that regard. What I was saying was it was desirable we
                            both make it clear we weren’t thereby renouncing our respective rights
                            of self-defense. I had tried to accomplish both purposes in this draft.
                            If Chinese have suggestions as to another method of reaching this, I was
                            willing listen.</p>
                        <p>50. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said in whatever way I
                            might put this matter, present US occupation Taiwan was flagrant
                            violation of international law. No matter how US was trying to defend
                            itself, history would pass final judgement. US had asked whether Chinese
                            side had any other views on draft announcement. He said his side had
                            made its greatest effort and could not go further. As <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> had said, if US would accept their
                            proposal to remove individual and collective self-defense from text,
                            then Chinese would give consideration to draft. Otherwise, they could
                            only consider that US was deliberately obstructing issuance of such
                            announcement.</p>
                        <p>51. I said how he could call inclusion of statement of what I thought was
                            universally recognized principle of individual and collective
                            self-defense obstruction, I could not understand. I had thought they
                            would have considered it of equal importance. As I had made clear, I
                            would be glad to consider any other formula they would like to propose.
                            I wanted to be clear: was it that under no circumstances whatever and
                            under no conditions that they would consider inclusion of any such
                            phrases in any statement we might make?</p>
                        <p>52. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said that dispute between
                            us in Taiwan area was what was under discussion and in this respect they
                            could not acknowledge US right to individual and collective
                            self-defense. It was matter of principle. This was not acceptable.
                            Question was not that there should be any further suggestions from
                            Chinese side but from the US side. And new suggestions should come from
                            US side.</p>
                        <p>53. I said that I entirely disagreed and that unless we both here were
                            willing together to work things out, I did not see how it was possible
                            to reach agreement. Negotiation was not a matter of unilateral
                            concessions, it was a matter of attempts to reach common agreements. I
                            had, with these few minor changes, accepted form and words of their
                            draft. This contrasted strongly with their refusal to accept my November
                            10 draft even as basis of discussion. As I saw <pb n="267"
                                xml:id="pg_267" facs="0295"/>it, principal question between us was
                            whether there should be any mention of individual and collective
                            self-defense in any agreement. I had tried to do so in manner agreeable
                            to them. I had expressed willingness to consider any other formula that
                            they considered would better fit their position. It was hard for me to
                            see how I could go further.</p>
                        <p>54. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said his points had also
                            been made clear. He could go no further than that.</p>
                        <p>55. I said that it did not seem that any further discussion today was
                            useful. I had nothing further on this if he had not.</p>
                        <p>56. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said he had made his
                            position very clear on this matter.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow paragraphs 57–88, which set forth Ambassador <persName

                                features of Communist proposal, but for purpose of preventing future
                                misunderstanding of scope and meaning, had introduced two clarifying
                                insertions a) making clear it applied to Taiwan area, and b) that it
                                was not intended to deny inherent right of two sides to individual
                                and collective self-defense.</item>

                            <item>Refer to <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s statement
                                last meeting that Communists would be willing consider inclusion
                                specific mention Taiwan area in renunciation of force declaration.
                                This represents step forward and leaves only self-defense issue

                            <item>Insist on necessity to include provision for individual and
                                collective self-defense for protection of rights of both sides. This
                                cannot possibly be objectionable to either side since it is right
                                long recognized by international law. It is expressly provided for
                                in Article 51 of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. Having
                                raised point, if US were now to agree to remove this provision from
                                declaration on renunciation of force, it could be construed as a
                                waiver by both sides of this inherent right and US cannot agree to
                                this. You should point out that this is not designed in any way to
                                commit Communists to renounce pursuit of their policies by peaceful
                                means with respect to Taiwan, as was stated in your November 10
                                draft.</item>

                            <item><gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. You should hold firm on this
                                point. Department considers Communists unlikely break over this, for
                                they would find their position difficult to defend publicly.
                                However, even if Communists should break on this, Department
                                considers it impossible to yield to Communist demand since this
                                could be claimed by Communists to be relinquishment US right to
                                enter collective defense arrangements in Taiwan area, and indeed its
                                right to defend its ships and forces, and to participate in defense
                                of offshore islands, if it decides to do so should they be attacked

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> opened meeting with long
                            prepared statement reiterating position of objection to individual and
                            collective security clause on grounds it would require them recognize
                            “U.S. occupation Taiwan”, referred my previous statements declaration
                            did not involve third parties but said attempt incorporate individual

                                “<persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> clique”. Then
                            referring my statements these talks must be free from threat of force,
                            launched into long and strong attack on alleged statements by Secretary
                            which constituted “clamor for atomic war against China”, “Chinese cannot
                            be intimidated”, “blackmail doomed to failure”, “condemned by
                            peaceloving people” etc., “this cannot benefit our talks”, “cannot but
                            raise question whether U.S. had genuine sincerity peacefully settle

                        <p>I replied with long extemporaneous statement first picking up his
                            statements concerning Secretary which I characterized as “entirely
                            uncalled for and gross libel.” Record of U.S. had more than demonstrated
                            lack aggressive intent toward other countries including China, cited
                            unparalleled U.S. restraint in Korea in face provocation Chinese <pb

                            and legal justification for defending U.N. forces attack Chinese bases.

                            independence other peoples. Purely defensive nature all U.S. collective
                            defense arrangements with other countries. President and Secretary have
                            repeatedly expressed overwhelming sentiment American people never to
                            initiate attack. There is nothing Secretary has ever said in any way
                            that could possibly be interpreted in terms employed by <persName

                                    no chances of your not having it. It is possible that it will
                                    either be mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_WP1"

                                        >Phleger</persName> remarked on Saturday undoubtedly the
                                    article would receive close study in Peiping. He felt that it
                                    would probably have an influence on Peiping moves although it
                                    could not be predicted what the influence would be. It might
                                    well have something of a restraining and sobering effect,
                                    although the possibility of a different reaction could not be

                            would have been ignored but could not be ignored when made by Secretary.
                            I said I had read article and find no statement by Secretary therein
                            which could remotely support <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                            >Wang</persName>’s allegations. Said he should not confuse official and
                            authorized statements with expressions of opinion made on own
                            responsibility by writer magazine article. During course discussion he
                            stated “hard to understand why U.S. on one hand invites <gloss

                            on verge unleashing atomic war against China”. I replied that I knew of
                            no such revelation by Secretary but did know of statements of
                            determination by U.S. to resist by war if necessary aggression unleashed

                            I stated and reiterated “U.S. cannot and will not under any

                                statement issued on January 18 by the Foreign Ministry in Peking
                                charged that the United States was deliberately dragging out the
                                Ambassadorial talks, had refused to come to an agreement on the
                                means for the relaxation of tension in the Taiwan area, and had
                                demanded Chinese acceptance of “the status quo of United States
                                armed occupation of Taiwan”. It declared that the only practical and
                                feasible means of settling disputes between China and the United

                            reflected by <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s statement “If
                            U.S. insists on including clause individual and collective self-defense
                            in Taiwan area, I do not see how we can reach any agreement.”</p>
                        <p>While he did not challenge neither did he confirm my reference to his

                        <p>He then initiated discussion implementation with relatively mild
                            statement giving me additional list of four names. Discussion for most

                        <p>At close of meeting I made statement referring their public statement
                            expressing disappointment, concern over effects on talks and made
                            somewhat double barreled query whether this indicated they did not
                            desire to continue these talks upon basis which I had suggested at
                            beginning of talks and which I had tried very hard to maintain. In reply
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> stressed their statement
                            only “one time operation” reasons for which he had given in two prior
                            meetings. Reaffirmed desire continue talks without suggesting
                            modification present procedures on publicity. He said “it my hope and
                            desire that talks will reach positive, constructive, honest
                            outcome.”</p>
                        <p>He took initiative suggesting next meeting, asking as special
                            accommodation be held Wednesday January 25. When I asked whether this
                            for just one meeting he replied hope next following meeting could be
                            held Friday February 3. But in response my suggestion February 2 instead
                            of February 3 next following meeting we agreed leave question open until
                            next meeting. (For Department’s information “Porgy and Bess” company

                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>. Their yesterday’s public
                            statement of course also tends rigidify their position at least for time
                            being.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s persistent relation of
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> objection on self-defense clause
                            to its linkage with Taiwan area suggests that way to agreement might be
                            by rephrasing and or repositioning clause. Question is who takes
                            initiative in suggesting change.</p>
                        <p>I do not see any immediate possibility breaking this deadlock and would
                            propose at next meeting only to carefully review and reiterate our
                            position.</p>
                        <p>Although not explicitly confirmed at today’s meeting, I feel that they
                            have accepted inclusion specific mention Taiwan, as well as “means” in
                            place of “negotiations”. Much of <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName>’s comments on self-defense clause were based on
                            implicit assumption Taiwan was included in paragraph.</p>
                        <p>I purposely refrained from my usual tactic of initiating implementation
                            discussion and he was quick to take initiative. In contrast to
                            acrimonious discussion of <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> article and
                            renunciation force, his manner and language in introducing
                            implementation and particularly when presenting additional list of names
                            was very mild and polite.</p>
                        <p>I also went some length in testing their desire continue meetings and it
                            is clear they desire to do so for immediate future. However, would be
                            rash to hazard any guess how long this may continue if no new element is
                            introduced.</p>
                        <p>In considering future course I am continuing consider effects on
                            remaining 13 Americans. I have no doubt if it were possible reach
                            agreement on renunciation force statement, particularly if initiative
                            came from US, additional releases would take place. In absence some such
                            development or additional indirect pressure that could be applied
                            difficult to foresee <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s fully
                            carrying out this commitment in near future. In this connection from
                            conversations with correspondents and private individuals here am
                            impressed with success of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>

                        <p>A statement issued on January 21, by the Department of State outlined the
                            course of the Ambassadorial discussions on renunciation of force; the
                            texts of the Chinese and United States proposals and counterproposals
                            were attached. A portion of the statement, headed “The United States
                            Position”, reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Two points must be made clear. First, the United States is not
                                    occupying Taiwan and Taiwan has never been a part of Communist
                                    China. The claims of Communist China and the contentions of the
                                    United States with respect to this area are well known and
                                    constitute a major dispute between them. It is specifically with
                                    respect to this dispute that the United States has proposed the
                                    principle of renunciation of force and the settlement of
                                    differences by peaceful means. This is the principle which the
                                    Communists say they have accepted.</p>
                                <p>“In this connection the United States has made completely clear
                                    that in renouncing the use of force neither side is
                                    relinquishing its objectives and policies but only the use of
                                    force to attain them.</p>
                                <p>“Secondly, the United States has rights and responsibilities in
                                    the Taiwan area; also it has a mutual defense treaty.
                                    Accordingly it is present in the Taiwan area. The Communist
                                    refusal to state that the renunciation of force is without
                                    prejudice to the right of self-defense against armed attack can
                                    only be interpreted as an attempt to induce the United States to
                                    agree that if attacked it will forgo the right to defend its
                                    lawful presence in this area.</p>
                                <p>“The right of individual and collective self-defense against
                                    armed attack is inherent; it is recognized in international law;
                                    it is specifically affirmed in the charter of the United
                                    Nations. No country can be expected to forgo this right. Indeed,
                                    the Communists should be as anxious to preserve this right as is
                                    the United States.”</p></quote></p>

                        <p>A statement issued on January 24 by the Foreign Ministry of the People’s
                            Republic of China reads in part as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“A settlement of the international question of the tension in the
                                    Taiwan area through negotiation between China and the United
                                    States must not be mixed up with China’s exercise of its
                                    sovereign right in the Taiwan area to settle a domestic matter.
                                    Taiwan is a part of China’s territory. No amount of sophistry
                                    can make out Taiwan a part of the United States and not a part
                                    of China. New China has succeeded to China’s entire territory
                                    and sovereignty. No statement by the United States Department of
                                    State can alter this indisputable fact. The relations of New
                                    China with the <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                        Kai-shek</persName> clique is China’s domestic matter.
                                    Whenever there is any possibility, China will strive for the

                            agreed announcement and the United States had not; that tension in the
                            Taiwan area was due to United States “armed occupation of Taiwan and
                            interference in China’s internal affairs” and a Sino-American meeting of
                            Foreign Ministers should be held to deal with this question; that a
                            statement on the renunciation of force “must lead to the elimination of
                            the force and threat of force employed by the United States in the

                        <p>“The Chinese Government after having studied the statement issued by the

                                corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and the Chinese Communist
                            representative in Geneva, feels constrained to present the following
                            views for the consideration of the US Government.</p>
                        <p>“Since the opening of the Geneva talks, the Chinese Government has in its
                            public pronouncements consistently supported the US effort to secure the
                            release of its nationals illegally held by the Chinese Communists. The
                            US Government has given repeated assurances that there would be no
                            discussion any matters involving the rights, claims, or essential
                            interests of the Republic of China. A careful study of the published
                            account of the talks thus far reveals, however, that the negotiations in
                            fact bear considerably upon the rights and interests of the Republic of
                            China.</p>
                        <p>“The Chinese Government views with particular concern the offer made by
                            the US to enter into a bilateral declaration with the Chinese Communist
                            regime concerning the renunciation of the use of force. Such a
                            declaration would be tantamount to an admission by the US to equal
                            responsibility for the existing situation in the Taiwan Strait, for
                            which the Chinese Communists should and must be held solely responsible.
                            In the form now proposed by the US it might be understood to imply a
                            tacit de facto recognition of the Chinese <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280"
                                facs="0308"/>Communist regime. It would be construed by the free
                            peoples in Asia and elsewhere as a further retreat of the US position
                            and would consequently weaken their determination of resisting Communist
                            inducement. It would also encourage those countries who are already
                            inclined towards the idea of two Chinas to pursue their machinations
                            with renewed and greater vigor. Since the Four-Power Conference in July,
                            1955, the tendency toward appeasement has already resulted in a series
                            of trade agreements and other contracts by a number of countries in Asia
                            and the Middle East with the Chinese Communist regime to the detriment
                            of the position and prestige of the Chinese Government. On the other
                            hand, the readiness on the part of the US, now made public, to accept
                            the puppet Chinese Communist regime as an equal party in negotiation,
                            together with the US willingness to renounce the use of force in an
                            arrangement with an aggressor, tends to enhance the international
                            position and prestige of the Chinese Communist regime whose flagrant
                            violations of the principles of the Charter have been condemned by the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and whose admission into the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> the US has consistently
                            opposed.</p>
                        <p>“The Chinese Government is deeply perturbed by the disclosure that,
                            throughout the negotiations between Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and the Communist
                            representative, the US has repeatedly assured the Communists that
                            renunciation by the Chinese Communists of the use of force would in no
                            way prejudice the peaceful pursuit of Communist policies in the Taiwan
                            area. It is regretted that the US Government should have found it
                            necessary to go to the extent of assuming such a position, the legal and
                            political implication of which could only mean that the US was not only
                            recognizing by inference the claims of the Chinese Communists, but was
                            also giving encouragement to the pursuit of such claims on the part of
                            the Chinese Communists. No amount of legal interpretation could conceal
                            the fact that any arrangement made with the Chinese Communists in the
                            terms offered by the US would gravely injure the basic rights and
                            interests of the Republic of China. The Chinese Government finds it
                            difficult to reconcile the position taken by the US in this regard with
                            the assurances repeatedly given the Republic of China and considers it
                            inconsistent with the spirit of the Sino-American Mutual Defense
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>“It may be recalled that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> has, both in writing and conversation with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, stressed the vital
                            importance for the Chinese Government to keep alive its political
                            objective of recovering the Chinese Mainland. Any action on the part of
                            the US which could be construed as de facto recognition of the Chinese
                            Communist regime would be tantamount to US denial of the right of the
                            Republic of China to strive for the deliverance of the Chinese people
                            from the yoke of the Communist tyranny. The Government <pb n="281"
                                xml:id="pg_281" facs="0309"/>of the Republic of China has done its
                            utmost to cooperate with the US in preserving peace in the Taiwan area.
                            It hopes, however, that the US will refrain from any action which would,
                            in the eyes of the free world and the Chinese people both on the outside
                            and Mainland, tend to support the view that the Chinese Mainland is lost
                            to the Communists forever.</p>
                        <p>“It is to be observed that, although the Communists have rejected the US
                            draft of January 12, 1956, the rejection may not be final and there
                            exists a possibility of their acceptance in substance at a later date
                            when it becomes advantageous for them to do so. Such possibility appears
                            even greater in view of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"

                            talks would be continued to a fruitful conclusion. The Chinese
                            Government would like to be informed whether in the event of an
                            agreement reached on the renunciation of use of force the US would
                            assume the position that the Chinese Communists have thereby
                            demonstrated their peace-loving intentions and are thus eligible for
                            admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Should such a
                            position be taken by other governments, such as those of India and the
                            United Kingdom, would the US continue to oppose the admission of the
                            Chinese Communists into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>? Above
                            all, can we be certain that the Chinese Communists would honor their
                            renunciation of the use of force?</p>
                        <p>“It has been the consistent view of the Chinese Government that the
                            Geneva talks, once permitted to go beyond the practical question of
                            civilian repatriation, would inevitably degenerate into favorable
                            platform for Communist propaganda and provide opportunities for
                            neutralist countries to further exert pressure on the US toward
                            appeasement. This view has unfortunately been borne out by recent
                            events.</p>
                        <p>“It is the considered opinion of the Chinese Government that, in the
                            interests of the US and the Republic of China as well as the free world
                            as a whole, the Geneva talks on the renunciation of the use of force
                            should be brought to an end as soon as possible. This is an opportune
                            moment to do so since the Communists by their refusal to accept the many
                            concessions made by the US could be held solely responsible for the
                            failure of the negotiations. As to the renewed proposal of the
                            Communists to raise the Geneva talks to a ministerial level, the Chinese
                            Government feels that such a step would only serve to accentuate the
                            implication of de facto recognition of the puppet regime in Peiping and
                            to open the way to further Communist demands.</p>

                        <p>“The Chinese Government would appreciate an early reply from the US

                                    >Yeh</persName> for a reply to the U.S. proposals of August 2
                                (see <ref target="frus1955-57v02#d275fn6">footnote 6, vol. <hi

                                the question of jurisdiction was a very delicate one for the
                                Chinese, since the Legislative <persName>Yuan</persName> was very
                                sensitive to anything suggestive of extraterritoriality, but
                                commented that they might be willing to accept a compromise. The
                                Embassy had several alternative formulas but was unwilling to
                                present them until the Chinese were ready to negotiate in earnest.

                                cannot call impasse, as alternatives have not yet even been

                            military on administrative matters which have occurred in proportion to
                            increase of US forces here, and to demonstrate that seeming laxity and
                            magnanimity of Ministry National Defense in dealings with US forces does
                            not permeate <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> structure and must

                            that agreement almost impossible. They may be assumed to represent
                            extreme Chinese bargaining position, but we should be prepared for long
                            difficult negotiations before our divergent positions reconciled.<note

                                from COMPACAF to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>,
                                January 23, presented a proposal to deploy to Taiwan one flight of a

                                    >Ibid.</hi>)</note> both <gloss target="#t_PASEP1"
                            >PASEP</gloss>. The addition of this unit to the defenses of Taiwan
                            would <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0312"/>undoubtedly give a big
                            boost to the morale of the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s on
                            the basis of its power alone. An additional and important factor would
                            be the added participation of the US in the defense of Taiwan
                            exemplified by the establishment of such a US unit on the island.
                            However in addition to the points made in my 272225Z is the ever growing
                            US military population in Taiwan. There are too many Americans there now
                            as emphasized by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RKL1"
                                >Rankin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Adm
                                Radford</persName> and as observed by myself and <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_PVAAM1">Pride</persName>. The high standard of
                            living of low level American military families is in marked contrast to
                            the low living standards of many high level Chinese. There is growing
                            evidence of Chinese resentment of both the number and living standards
                            of Americans. This reaction is natural and normal and not alarming but
                            it is still unfortunate. I am studying means of limiting the further
                            growth and if possible reducing and centralizing control of the US
                            military population in Taiwan. Of primary concern to me is the increase
                            of US operational units on Taiwan for the defense of Taiwan over which
                            the commander Taiwan defense command has no control. This is basically
                            and fundamentally unsound and should be resolved before any more
                            operational units are established. Taipei [685] 26 Jan 8 pm passed to

                                expedite Americans’ return, in at least two cases some six weeks

                        <p>[Here follows a list of subjects discussed and a record of discussion
                            concerning Southeast Asia.]</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">China</hi></p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the military position was important, especially
                            in the Formosa area. He recalled that the Geneva talks with the Chinese
                            Communists had been going on since August 1. The discussions were not in
                            a healthy state at the moment. The US had hoped to get its imprisoned
                            nationals out of Communist China. These Americans are held on political
                            charges. Weeks had been consumed in debating whether the repatriation
                            arrangement would cover Americans held for these alleged offenses. The
                            Agreed Announcement <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0315"/>which was
                            finally issued at Geneva made it clear that all Americans were covered.
                            The Announcement contains no qualification as to the right of all
                            Americans in China to repatriation. We were discussing a list of 19
                            imprisoned Americans at the time of the Announcement. Only six have been
                            released since then. None have been released for some time. The Chinese
                            Communists have gone back to their original position, that the
                            declaration should not apply to prisoners.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Communists want to talk about the trade embargo and their
                            proposal for a higher level meeting. The US has said that it does not
                            wish to talk about other subjects under the menace of force and has
                            asked for a renunciation of force declaration. The Chinese Communists
                            have indicated they were willing to make a declaration renouncing force
                            in international affairs as defined by them, but not in regard to
                            Formosa issues, in as much as they consider Formosa a domestic question.
                            Each side has put forward a draft and a counter draft, none of which is
                            acceptable to the other side. It seems that we are pretty near the end
                            of the road, with each side holding firmly to its present position.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that of course it could be alleged by the Chinese
                            Communists that Formosa is a domestic affair. The same contention could
                            be made as to other divided countries such as Korea, Indochina, and
                            Germany. This view is not realistic, since everyone knows that as a
                            practical affair conflict between the contending sides in these divided
                            countries would lead to war, and so the issues are international in
                            scope.</p>
                        <p>The next Geneva meeting is scheduled for February 4. It seems likely that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s speech of
                            January 30 in Peiping<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2"><p>Reference is to
                                    Premier <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Rockefeller</persName>’s
                                    political report before the National Committee of the Chinese
                                    People’s Political Consultative Conference. His remarks
                                    concerning Taiwan read in part as follows:</p>
                                <p>“In the past year, our Government has pointed out over and over
                                    again that apart from liberating Taiwan by means of war, there
                                    exists also the possibility of liberating Taiwan by peaceful
                                    means. Thus, the people of our country, both on the mainland and
                                    in Taiwan, have a common patriotic duty, that is, to strive for
                                    the liberation of Taiwan by peaceful means, besides actively
                                    preparing for its liberation by means of war if necessary.”</p>
                                <p>The text of the speech is printed as a supplement to <hi
                                        rend="italic">People’s China</hi>, February 16,
                                1956.</p></note> has some bearing on the Geneva talks. In that
                            speech he openly threatened the use of force. We do not know whether he
                            means it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang
                                Ping-nan</persName> in the course of the talks at Geneva has never
                            separated the off-shore islands from Formosa. There has never been any
                            distinction between these Communist objectives. The US does not
                            recognize any distinction in the Communist claims either. But it is
                            interesting to observe that the <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0316"
                            />Chinese Communists would not modify their demand for Formosa even if
                            the Nationalists could be induced to abandon Quemoy and Matsu.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that the artillery duels between the offshore
                            islands and the mainland have been intensified in the last few weeks.
                            However, the U.S. Watch Committee which is closely following daily
                            developments in the area, feels that preparations are not yet in place
                            for an offensive against the off-shore islands. Not even a limited
                            offensive is expected immediately.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked if the Chinese
                            Nationalists have strengthened their positions on the off-shore
                            islands?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there was a reinforcement about a year ago but he was
                            not aware of any marked recent increase.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> thought there had
                            been some slight increase. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1"
                                >Robertson</persName> mentioned the Communist effort to build a
                            causeway from the mainland to Tateng, and Chinese Nationalist artillery
                            fire to interfere with this construction.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked if
                            the US considered the Chinese Nationalist position on the off-shore
                            islands defensible.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the Nationalist forces were strongly entrenched
                            and quite a military effort would be necessary to dislodge them. The
                            greatest difficulty lay in the field of resupply. The anchorages were
                            vulnerable to artillery and air bombardment.</p>
                        <p>Showing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> a map, the
                            Secretary said the military situation was complicated by the fact that
                            small islands were included in both the Matsu and the Quemoy complexes.
                            Artillery emplaced on the small islands could threaten either the larger
                            islands or the mainland. He thought the questions as to whether an
                            assault on the islands could succeed and whether such assaults would be
                            directly related to the security of Formosa were open ones.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> was very
                            worried over the military situation in the area. It was not a question
                            of the intrinsic value of the islands but of the possibility that
                            hostilities originating there might spread.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the situation there did not seem as warm as it was a
                            year ago, but it was probably just as warm as it was 5 or 6 months ago.
                            The US intelligence estimate was that a large-scale attack on the
                            outlying islands within the next few months was doubtful, but it was
                            never possible to be sure about these things. The opportunities for the
                            Chinese Communists to improve their international position by
                            maintaining a peaceful posture for the time being might make them
                            indisposed to gamble on a military effort in the Formosa area. The
                            Chinese Communists hoped to get into the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. They were trying to exploit neutralist sentiment. They
                            were engaged in a lot of schemes which they attached importance to. All
                            this <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0317"/>would be jeopardized by a
                            military adventure. So the US political estimate coincided with that of
                            the military. An early attack is not considered probable.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he knew the British were thinking along the lines
                            of the desirability of inducing the Chinese Nationalists to withdraw
                            from the off-shore islands. He did not think this was a practicable
                            thing to do. Relinquishment of the islands would undoubtedly have a very
                            bad effect on the morale of the Chinese on Formosa. It was the
                            considered judgment of the Chinese Government that the security of
                            Formosa would be undermined by withdrawal from the off-shore islands.
                            The US could not dissent from this finding. In any event, the US could
                            not force the Nationalists to abandon the off-shore islands. The US had
                            investigated the possibility of prevailing on the Chinese Nationalists
                            to lower their estimate of the importance of the off-shore islands. The
                            result had been negative. There could be no possibility of changing the
                            Chinese Nationalist position as to the off-shore islands without drastic
                            action. Drastic action would have consequences more dangerous than a
                            continuation of the present situation. It was out of the question.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said the
                            British presumed that if the Nationalist forces on the off-shore islands
                            were destroyed the situation would be worse for them than if they
                            voluntarily withdrew from the islands now.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said this could not be taken as certain. The Chinese
                            Government felt that it was better to put up a good fight and lose than
                            to give up voluntarily. It is not certain that the Chinese Nationalists
                            would lose. The US position in the event of a Chinese Communist attack
                            was not decided. Under the Mutual Defense Treaty and the Joint
                            Resolution of last January it would be left to the judgment of the
                            President. The President would consider the problem in the context of
                            the security of Formosa. So far the Chinese Communists have never
                            disassociated the seizure of the off-shore islands from the seizure of
                            Formosa. They have always lumped the two together.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary showed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> on a
                            map the progress of the Chinese Communist airfield buildup in the Fukien
                            area opposite Formosa. He mentioned that seven new fields will be
                            completed by April 1. Several of the fields are nearly prepared for use
                            but are not actually operational yet. They can be occupied on short
                            notice.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> asked if there
                            were 7 jet airfields altogether.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said there were 10
                            altogether, constructed or in the course of construction.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned the railroad being built to the Fukien coast. The
                            rail line to Amoy was expected to be usable by the end of <pb n="290"
                                xml:id="pg_290" facs="0318"/>this year. Another rail extension to
                            Foochow was scheduled for completion somewhat later.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> mentioned the bad
                            effect which any withdrawal in the face of Chinese Communist threats
                            would have on the overseas Chinese. It would tend inevitably to throw
                            them into the Peiping orbit.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that
                            he knew Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> wanted to talk
                            further on this subject. He thought perhaps the subject might be left
                            until then.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that
                            he knew that the United States had difficulties at home in regard to the
                            China trade embargo issue. He said that his Government also had
                            difficulties at home on this question and on the issue of Chinese
                            representation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Each year it
                            becomes a little more difficult for the Government to defend the
                            “moratorium” arrangement<note n="3" xml:id="d142fn3">Pursuant to an
                                informal agreement reached in June 1951, the United States and the
                                United Kingdom supported proposals to postpone consideration of
                                Chinese representation whenever that question had been raised in the
                                United Nations and specialized agency bodies.</note> than the year
                            before. He did not think “the end of the world” would come as a result
                            of this difficulty but he wanted the Secretary to know that the question
                            was not an easy one for the United Kingdom. It “weakened the alliance a
                            bit” on the British side. British acceptance of the moratorium idea was
                            widely considered “not reasonable” in the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>. The Government was asked why it did not come out and
                            take a stand on this clear-cut issue, rather than postpone its
                            consideration year after year. The Government reply was “Why put added
                            strain on the alliance by taking a position opposed to that of the
                            U.S.?” This reply had sufficed so far but the justification became more
                            difficult each year.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said admission of Communist China to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would certainly put more strain on the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He said that the President would
                            like to speak to the Prime Minister on that subject. The President felt
                            strongly on the issue. The President feared that it would not be
                            practicable to maintain <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> headquarters
                            in the U.S. if Communist China were admitted to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> under present circumstances. Admission of
                            Communist China would create a serious problem for the U.S. The U.S.
                            would hope very much to continue the moratorium arrangement until there
                            was a real reason to change it. The business of keeping the arrangement
                            on a calendar year basis did not seem very satisfactory to the U.S.,
                            although apparently the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> preferred that
                            formula.</p>
                        <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0319"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished the two Governments could get together on
                            China policy. This was the only area where a difference of any real
                            substance existed, although there might be some limited divergence in
                            the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the problem of holding the insular positions around
                            the great Eurasian land mass held by the Communists was difficult but
                            the U.S. Government felt strongly that it had to be solved. It was
                            important not only for the U.S. but for all countries. The retention of
                            the positions in the Western Pacific was basic for the U.S. If we lost
                            the chain of positions in the Western Pacific stretching from the
                            Aleutians to Australia and New Zealand, it would be almost as bad as if
                            we lost the Atlantic positions. From a physical defense standpoint it
                            would be about equally disastrous. We would have to fall back to the
                            continental U.S., possibly being able to keep the Hawaiian Islands. The
                            western rim of the Pacific was extremely vital to the U.S. from a
                            defense standpoint. It was very hard to hold these peripheral positions
                            against the great mass of Communist China. This referred to both the
                            land mass and the mass of people. Furthermore, the Chinese mainland
                            traditionally exerts a great influence on the entire Western Pacific
                            area. There is additionally a large and active Chinese population
                            throughout this area. Often the Chinese population in Southeast Asian
                            countries constitutes a decisive balance. If the Chinese communities
                            swing over to Communist China and become loyal to the Chinese Communist
                            regime—and this would be likely to happen if the U.S. and other
                            countries accept the Chinese Communists as the only Government of all
                            China—all our difficulties in trying to hold the area would be greatly
                            multiplied. The situation would be simple if Communist China was not
                            hostile to everything the U.S. believes in. Unfortunately that hostility
                            does exist.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled that some people argued that if you accept the
                            Communist regime on the mainland, it would be possible to wean it away
                            from the Soviet Union. This was risky advice. The U.S. must avoid
                            enhancement of the power position of the Chinese Communist regime in the
                            absence of a break between Moscow and Peiping. Even if it is conceded
                            that an eventual cleavage between Peiping and Moscow may occur, action
                            now based on this assumption would enable the Chinese Communists during
                            the intermediate period before the break to take over the entire Western
                            position in Asia and the Far East. So long as this strong hostility
                            exists on the part of Communist China—so long as the impact of violent
                            revolution on the mainland is undiminished (and there does seem to be
                            more violence in the Chinese Communist revolution than in the Soviet
                            revolution today)—the only course that will protect U.S. vital interests
                            (and perhaps British vital interests, too) is to refrain from <pb
                                n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0320"/>taking any action which would
                            strengthen the Chinese Communist regime.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that some seem to think this position unreasonable. He
                            thought it was highly reasonable. He wished that the Foreign Secretary
                            could share that view. The Secretary considered the issue almost as
                            vital for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as for the U.S., even
                            though the British home islands were not washed by the waters of the
                            Pacific. He recalled that the British had to consider Australia, New
                            Zealand, Malaya and Singapore, all of which were in a [<hi rend="italic"
                                >the</hi>] critical area he was talking about.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said it
                            seemed to his Government that from a long term standpoint present
                            policies toward Communist China tended to cement Communist China and the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. His Government felt there
                            were fundamental natural differences between Russia and China. If we
                            stopped our interference, nature would reassert itself. Major
                            differences would develop between the two principal Communist powers.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that he agreed as
                            to the dangerous effects on the overseas Chinese of any concessions to
                            Communist China. The question was where and how to strike a balance
                            between the opposing considerations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would agree that if you took a look down the long
                            vistas of time, eventual differences between Moscow and Peiping could be
                            anticipated. The Foreign Secretary was right from that standpoint. But
                            these natural rivalries might take 100 years to assert themselves. A
                            caller had recently remarked to him that 100 years from now the U.S. and
                            Russia would be allied against China.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Secretary said at least he and the Secretary presumably
                            wouldn’t have to worry about the question at that time.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that on the basis of history and tradition,
                            differences some day would probably emerge. It was a problem of timing.
                            A policy not only had to be right, it had to be right at the right time.
                            The question of gains for Communist China in the intermediate period was
                            one of great gravity for the U.S. There would be no profit for the
                            non-Communist world if differences emerged between the Soviet Union and
                            Communist China after our vital interests have already been impaired.
                            For this reason any weakness of the Western position was fraught with
                            danger. Maybe the Moscow-Peiping alliance would some day fall apart. But
                            would it happen quickly enough? The Secretary recalled that in World War
                            II, it was freely predicted that the Axis partners would split, should
                            they win. But the Allies did not stop fighting on that account.</p>
                        <p>The necessity for curbing Communist China has a bearing on the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership question and also on the trade
                            control question, although as to the latter, the psychological factors
                            were perhaps more important than the commercial ones. The commercial
                            considerations <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0321"/>were of course
                            not without importance. As he saw it, the problem was, “How are we going
                            to hold these detached insular positions at least until the evolution of
                            Chinese Communist internal policy makes the regime no longer hostile and
                            no longer to be feared?” Only by holding the strongest possible moral
                            barriers against the Chinese Communists would it be possible to maintain
                            a defensive position against them.</p>

                        <p>[Here follows a list of subjects discussed, a brief summary of Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ report to the
                            President and Prime Minister on his discussions that morning with
                            Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, and a
                            record of discussion concerning Vietnam and the question of Chinese
                            representation in the United Nations (scheduled for inclusion in the

                        <p>The subject then switched to the off-shore islands. Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said he was particularly
                            worried about this situation and that he had hoped the US would persuade
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> to
                            evacuate these islands. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> replied that he could <pb n="294"

                                >Chiang Kai-shek</persName>. He said that the Nationalist Government
                            considered the islands to be of great importance. He explained <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>’s position that to lose the
                            islands under attack after a stiff fight was one thing but to abandon
                            them without a fight would cause great consternation and deterioration
                            in morale not only in Taiwan but also among the millions of overseas
                            Chinese scattered through Southeast Asia. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> asked what the United States would
                            do if the Communists attacked the offshore islands. He emphasized the
                            British view that Formosa was one question and the offshore islands
                            quite another. The President said he understood the British position. He
                            did not say what he would do.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reviewed
                            Communist preparations on the mainland opposite Taiwan citing
                            particularly the building of ten new airfields which would accommodate
                            jet planes and the military railroad now under construction between
                            Yingtan and the port of Amoy which was expected to be completed by the
                            end of the year.<note n="2" xml:id="d143fn2"><p>The conversation was

                                    of the offshore islands as follows:</p>
                                <p>“Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony</persName> then took up
                                    the situation with regard to the off-shore islands, and said he
                                    was worried about this problem. The President said he had given
                                    a great deal of personal thought and attention to this whole
                                    problem and the situation was simply that if we tried to press
                                        <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> too hard to
                                    give up the islands, Formosa might be lost and the whole
                                    position in the Far East might crumble. He had tried to have
                                        <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> persuaded that
                                    it is a military mistake to place such strength and stake his
                                    prestige on the off-shore islands in this manner, but that the
                                    effort had not been successful. In his opinion, they should be
                                    considered as an outpost, but <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                        >Chiang</persName> had said that abandonment of the islands
                                    would result in loss of face and of any hold over Chinese not
                                    only on Formosa but also in Malaya and elsewhere in the Far
                                    East. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                                    said that while the situation with regard to these islands
                                    flares up occasionally, he is inclined to think that large-scale
                                    attack in the near future is unlikely, and said that he
                                    understands this to be the opinion of top U.S. Military people.
                                    While airfields have been built opposite Formosa, they have not
                                    been equipped or provisioned for operations, and that there has
                                    been no build-up or massing of the forces which might be used
                                    for assault. There is, of course, the danger of interdiction of
                                    the islands with artillery, preventing their support and supply.
                                    Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony</persName> said that the
                                    question which was uppermost in their minds is, if <persName
                                        corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> has built up the islands
                                    with a large part of his forces, and is attacked, what then
                                    happens with regard to U.S. action in the area? He also enquired
                                    if the islands were attacked and fell would not the effect on
                                    morale in Formosa be disastrous? The President said that
                                        <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>
                                    apparently believed to lose after a hard fight would be less
                                    damaging than a voluntary withdrawal.”</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName>, who returned on
                            January 30 from consultations in Taipei, remarked that he had had five
                            or six conferences with the Generalissimo and other key members of the
                            Government during the six days he was in Taipei. The conferences had
                            included, besides the Generalissimo, Vice President <persName>Chen
                                Cheng</persName>, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said the current
                            misgivings of his Government as to the continuation of the Ambassadorial
                            talks at Geneva were fully summarized in the Chinese Aide-Mémoire of
                            January 25.<note n="2" xml:id="d144fn2">See <ref target="#d138">Document
                                    138</ref>.</note> The Generalissimo had made statements to him
                            which confirmed the Generalissimo’s personal association with these
                            misgivings. The Generalissimo was unhappy with the situation and very
                            much concerned. The Generalissimo had charged the Ambassador with the
                            mission of conveying his apprehensions frankly to the Department. The
                            current conversations with the British in Washington were an additional
                            source of uneasiness.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that, regardless of what was actually going on at
                            Geneva, the very fact of the continuation of the talks gave rise to
                            misunderstandings. This was a bad situation. It seemed in the Far East
                            that the U.S. did not object to the sort of de facto recognition of the
                            Chinese Communist regime apparently implied in the protracted talks. The
                            proposals of the two sides as to renunciation of force as revealed in
                            the press releases from Peiping and Washington were disquieting to the
                            Chinese Government. The United States draft seemed to place the two
                            parties on an equal footing. A mutual declaration or exchange of
                            pledges, bilateral in character, was sought by the United States
                            Government with the Chinese Communists. The Ambassador said he knew that
                            the United States wanted to commit the other side to peaceful methods,
                            but the proposed form of the commitment gave <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296"
                                facs="0324"/>rise to uneasiness in Taipei. The Ambassador thought it
                            was not realistic for us to put an emphasis on “peaceful settlement”
                            when we knew that the Communists would not respect any peace pledge
                            unless it suited their purposes. He recalled that the United States
                            Government was pledged not to discuss anything at Geneva concerning the
                            claims, rights or essential interests of the Government of the Republic
                            of China in its absence. His Government considered that the official
                            Chinese Communist and United States statements on the talks of January
                            18 and January 21 showed that matters which involved the claims, rights
                            and essential interests of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had
                            in fact been discussed. His Government took the view that the United
                            States Government apparently did not care what claims the Communists put
                            forward, or how they prosecuted those claims, so long as the Communists
                            did not resort to war. It seemed that the United States Government did
                            not even object to the Chinese Communist claim to Taiwan, if it were
                            peacefully pursued. He said the Chinese Government thought it discerned
                            “some sort of a lurking intention to pursue the theory of two Chinas”.
                            This the Chinese Government must always oppose. The Generalissimo
                            actually feared that the United States might be veering around toward a
                            one China—a Red China—concept.</p>
                        <p>The Generalissimo said that his people—especially the two million from
                            the Mainland now in Taiwan—still lived for the day when they could go
                            back to the Mainland. Many of the overseas Chinese regarded the Mainland
                            with the same sort of longing. This attitude was also found among the
                            great majority of the Chinese Armed Forces, although he conceded that
                            the native Taiwanese now being recruited into the Army in growing
                            numbers did not particularly have this feeling. When the Chinese who
                            have ties to the Mainland read of statements by United States leaders
                            which throw cold water on the possibility of a free Mainland being
                            reestablished, their hopes become more remote and it is harder to keep
                            alive their will to resistance. The people of Free China are “on the
                            front line” and it is important to nourish their fundamental hopes. As
                            the Chinese Government has informed Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName>, a very high degree of
                            sensitivity exists in Taiwan to external developments affecting the
                            prospects of Free China. Maybe their growing apprehensions are not well
                            founded, but it is important for the United States representatives to
                            know that these apprehensions exist. He wanted to convey with frankness
                            precisely how the responsible officials of the Chinese Government feel
                            on this issue.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador declared that President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName> was very upset by the omission of any reference
                            to the Government of the Republic of China in the Department’s official
                            statement of January 21. It was almost as if the United States did not
                            wish to take public cognizance <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0325"
                            />of the existence of the Chinese Government. The Ambassador said that
                            he thought he knew the reason—desire in principle to avoid provocative
                            matters which might jeopardize the talks. But the Chinese Government was
                            bound to notice the omission, especially when the United States
                            Government took pains to call the Chinese Communists the “Peoples
                            Republic of China”. The Ambassador said he had tried to explain this to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>, but it was
                            difficult to explain.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the Generalissimo looked to the United States as
                            China’s most trusted friend and ally. He was deeply grateful for the
                            large measure of material support extended by the United States. But he
                            hoped also for moral support. From the psychological standpoint the
                            recent developments participated in by the United States had constituted
                            the worst possible blow to the Chinese Government. The more the Chinese
                            Government read and studied the official statements and proposals
                            related to the Geneva talks, the less hope they saw in the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that the
                            Chinese Communists are very quick to exploit any opening given them by
                            the United States. Immediately after the recent exchange of public
                            statements on the Geneva talks, the Chinese Communists had stepped up
                            their psychological campaign to induce defections on Taiwan. They had
                            called on the Chinese in Taiwan to transfer their allegiance to the
                            Communists. The Communists had held out a guarantee of safety to all
                            Chinese on Taiwan who defected to the Communists. They had invited them
                            to come to the Mainland to see their relatives and had assured them of
                            freedom of travel. They had offered positions to Chinese intellectuals
                            on Taiwan. The Chinese Government was doing what it could to counter
                            these pressures and inducements, but the task was not easy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> observed that of
                            course the Communists would try to obtain defections, regardless of the
                            talks at Geneva. Naturally they would prefer to obtain their objectives
                            by subversion if they could without having to fight.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that the
                            Communists were certainly stepping up their subversive attempts and
                            their prospects seemed to be improving. He thought that from a logical
                            standpoint we might have pushed the Communists into a corner at Geneva,
                            but the Communists had from a psychological standpoint come out pretty
                            well in the public exchange of statements.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that the
                            Ambassador’s remarks indicated the Chinese Government had misunderstood
                            by 180 degrees the position the United States Government was taking in
                            the conversations at Geneva. The United States thinks it has maintained
                            a good position in Geneva. The declaration renouncing force which we are
                            still seeking <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0326"/>from the Chinese
                            Communists is no more or less than what the 60 members of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> subscribe to. We are not seeking anything
                            of the Chinese Communists at Geneva which goes beyond that.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government has not asked the Chinese Government to give
                            up anything. We think the talks may actually serve the interests of the
                            Chinese Government by reducing the likelihood of an attack on the
                            off-shore islands. We want to save the off-shore islands for the Chinese
                            Government if we can. So far the Chinese Communists have refused to
                            agree to a renunciation of force in the Taiwan area. This refusal
                            certainly does not improve the international standing of the Chinese
                            Communists, or undermine the position of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that his
                            Government was unhappy with the <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of the
                            renunciation of force declaration proposed by the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that the
                            conversations at Geneva had nothing to do with recognition—de facto or
                            otherwise. If the Generalissimo understood how firmly the United States
                            Government supports the position of the Chinese Government, his attitude
                            would be different. If the Generalissimo could have heard the President
                            speak on this subject to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName>, the Generalissimo would have been delighted. The
                            President branded the Chinese Communists as aggressors and oppressors
                            who are a threat to the peace of the world. The President said he was
                            not prepared to see them shoot their way into the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. He had informed <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> that the great majority of the American people and
                            Congress were strongly opposed to any such proposal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said it seemed the
                            Chinese Government representatives did not want to accept the very
                            explicit assurances they have repeatedly received from United States
                            representatives. He did not know what more could be done to reassure the
                            Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said his
                            Government was unable to see why it was necessary for the United States
                            Government to try to join in an agreement with the Chinese
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said it was not a
                            joint agreement, but separate declarations or announcements that were
                            proposed. Furthermore the United States insisted that any declaration
                            specifically include the general area of Taiwan. The Communists want to
                            exclude Taiwan. The United States insistence that any renunciation of
                            force must include the Taiwan area is in the best interests of the
                            Chinese Government and the free world.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said, “Suppose the
                            Communists accept your no force proposal. Would the United States then
                            consider the Chinese Communists as peace loving?” If the United States
                            insistently presses <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0327"/>for a
                            declaration from the Chinese Communists some significance presumably
                            would have to be attached to Communist compliance with the United States
                            request. The United States would have to accept the consequences of the
                            agreement. There would be more pressure from other nations for <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership for Communist China and the
                            pressure would be harder to resist.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said there could
                            hardly be more pressure along this line from certain other nations than
                            we are already encountering. We have resisted these pressures and will
                            continue to do so.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> asked what the
                            United States would do next if the Communists agreed to the United
                            States proposal? There would have to be something in return and the
                            Communists would press hard for concessions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said the Chinese
                            Communists still had 350,000 troops in North Korea. Their aggression was
                            not terminated. The Ambassador said this was a good point. He said
                            Indo-China might also be mentioned in this connection.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said his people
                            thought British Far Eastern policy was making a lot of trouble for the
                            United States as well as for Free China. The British appeared to be
                            pushing in the opposite direction from the United States in the Far
                            East. The Generalissimo thought the British were pursuing a very
                            unrealistic policy. He thought their policy toward Communist China had
                            two motivations: (1) to salvage the large British investment in Mainland
                            China; (2) to recover the lost China trade. The Generalissimo had
                            observed that obviously neither objective was obtainable so long as a
                            Soviet-affiliated Communist regime remained in power in China, and the
                            British should not deceive themselves.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> recalled that the
                            British have now had diplomatic relations with the Chinese Communists
                            for six years. During that time the British have lost all their large
                            economic stakes in China. The Communists always treat trade as a
                            political instrument. It should be apparent to the British that they
                            cannot salvage their China investments or their China trade unless the
                            National Government is reestablished on the Mainland. The Ambassador
                            thought that some British businessmen are beginning to realize this, but
                            not the British Government. It might be possible for the Generalissimo
                            to give a pledge or some sort of assurance to the British Government
                            that British commercial interests would be restored when the Chinese
                            Government regained control of the Mainland, although such an assurance
                            might seem academic at this time. He did not know whether the United
                            States Government had ever thought along this line. If the United States
                            Government should convey some intimation to the foregoing effect to the
                            British Government it might start the British officials to thinking.</p>
                        <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0328"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said we had
                            conveyed our views on China policy to the British many times. He feared
                            that British thinking had not been influenced thereby and would not be
                            influenced now. He thought the British Government had been pressured by
                            the large British business interests in China to recognize the
                            Communists in 1950. British business had hoped to save its China stake
                            of a billion dollars thereby. But British recognition had only helped
                            the Chinese Communists. The British say they want to promote free and
                            independent Governments throughout the Far East. But their Far Eastern
                            policies have had the opposite effect. He feared that the China policy
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had been extremely stupid.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the misgivings expressed by Ambassador <persName

                                >Robertson</persName> said he would again state that the United
                            States Government does not intend to recognize in any way the Communist
                            regime in Peiping. Nor would the United States agree to the admission of
                            Communist China to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. United States
                            sentiment was overwhelmingly opposed both to recognition and <gloss

                            whether the Generalissimo and Foreign Minister <persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said at the same
                            time he wished to put the Chinese Government on notice that we do not
                            intend to break off the Geneva talks. The United States wants to get the
                            American prisoners out of Red China and it wants to obtain a
                            renunciation of force declaration from the Chinese Communists. The
                            United States will continue to pursue these objectives, even if its
                            efforts are misunderstood.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> referred to recent
                            statements by the Generalissimo about return to the Mainland. He did not
                            understand what the Generalissimo hoped to accomplish by such
                            statements. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>
                            recalled that the Secretary had expressed doubts about the wisdom of
                            these repeated threats to regain the Mainland by force, which could not
                            be carried out. The Generalissimo had a larger mission, as the head of
                            Free China, than that of making promises and threats which he could not
                            implement. He should keep in a position to capitalize on any major turn
                            of events on the Mainland. But he must know that he cannot hope to
                            recapture the Mainland with his relatively small army alone. And he also
                            knows that the United States will not join in an offensive war—against
                            the China Mainland or any other place. The United States Congress
                            certainly would not sanction a war to overthrow the Communist regime and
                            put the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> back on the Mainland. We
                            would not be drawn into an offensive conflict in Korea or Vietnam
                            either. The United States was not going to war, except defensively. We
                            have only defensive treaties. This fact should be realistically
                            accepted. The Generalissimo was a brilliant military strategist and he
                            must realize that he can not do the job alone. At the same time a lot of
                            things might happen. If the Chinese <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301"
                                facs="0329"/>Communists should attack in Korea or Indochina it might
                            be a good thing for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces to
                            strike on the flank. If so, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            forces would receive assistance. If there should be an internal collapse
                            of the Communist regime, or if the Communists should engage in military
                            adventures somewhere else, the Chinese Government should be in a
                            position to capitalize on the event. Preparedness for any such
                            development was reasonable, but the Generalissimo’s invasion statements
                            were hard to understand. It alienated support here and created anxiety
                            generally. It tended to make the Chinese Government seem irresponsible
                            and to weaken its international position. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> lost some standing every time such statements were
                            made. As an admirer and supporter of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1"
                                >Robertson</persName> said he could not help but be distressed by
                            such statements. Just as President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> in Korea could not go north on his own, the
                            Generalissimo could not cross the Taiwan Strait alone.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that the
                            Generalissimo fully understood all this. Although the Generalissimo had
                            not stressed his desire for peace, this love of peace was very real with
                            him. But he wanted a real, honorable and lasting peace. The
                            Generalissimo felt he must do everything possible to preserve the
                            legitimate aspirations of his people and to keep up morale.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> remarked that it
                            should always be remembered that the American people cannot and will not
                            let President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> or President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> declare war for them.
                            Only the United States Congress could do this.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said this was very
                            clear to all concerned. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName> would certainly respect the undertaking he had
                            made not to engage in offensive warfare without the concurrence of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said he was fully
                            convinced of that. He knew that President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName> was a man of integrity and honor, but the
                            Mainland invasion statements which had been issued lately were difficult
                            to rationalize.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said it was merely
                            an effort to counteract Communist propaganda designed to undermine
                            morale on Taiwan. The Generalissimo felt he had to keep hope alive.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> wondered whether it
                            was wise to mislead. The creation of illusory hopes could be
                            counterproductive. It would seem preferable for the Generalissimo to
                            counsel patience. The references to recapturing the mainland lost force
                            if exposed as bluff. If the Communists violated the truce, it would be a
                            different situation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that when a
                            pall of gloom descended, it was necessary to do something to dispel
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that the
                            Generalissimo must know that his army of say 400,000 could not alone
                            buck a Communist army of 3.5 <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0330"/>or
                            4 million. It seemed bad psychologically to imply that it could be done.
                            But it was not for him to judge the Generalissimo’s speeches.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said there is a
                            constant need to reaffirm that hope still exists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said that nothing
                            had been done at Geneva which would extinguish any hopes.</p>

                                        give and take, to sharpen and clarify issue on self-defense
                                        clause in renunciation force draft. I am sure there can now
                                        be no possibility of their misunderstanding our position. I
                                        did not feel I could go any further without danger of
                                        erroneously implying willingness eventually negotiate away

                                out that Communist argument really adds up to demand that US concede

                                for discussion after renunciation of force has been agreed to.
                                Particularly point out that Communists continue to insist that US
                                concede that Taiwan and off-shore islands are Communist territory
                                when fact is that US position is that they have never been Communist

                        <p>At a meeting of the National Security Council on February 9, during
                            discussion of Korea, there were several comments and exchanges relating
                            to China: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The President replied [to a question concerning the cost of
                                    continuing cost of support for South Korea] that the crux of the
                                    problem was Communist China. After referring to the problem of
                                    having had to fight an ‘unwinnable’ war in Korea, he added that
                                    to retreat from Korea now would cost the United States its
                                    entire position in the Far East. He desperately wished,
                                    nonetheless, that there were some way for the United States to
                                    extricate itself from this swamp of spending. If Red China,
                                    speculated the President, should finally get out of North Korea,
                                    release our prisoners, and act decently, how in the world could
                                    the United States continue to avoid recognizing Communist China?
                                    It was a real problem, and the President repeated his belief
                                    that all our Far Eastern problems focussed up in
                                Korea.”</p></quote></p>
                        <p>After comments by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            concerning Korea, <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said
                                    that he was somewhat reluctant to raise so explosive a matter,
                                    but it was part of the same general problem. Now that we are
                                    under less terrific pressure from Communist China, was any
                                    thought being given to the problem of what we will do about
                                    Quemoy and the Matsus?</p>
                                <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                                    indicated that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                        >Humphrey</persName> was quite mistaken in his assumption
                                    that we were under less pressure at the moment from Communist
                                    China with respect to the offshore islands and Taiwan. In point
                                    of fact, the pressure was so severe that the talks which were
                                    going on in Geneva at the Ambassadorial level might well be
                                    broken off this very day. The Chinese Communists were insisting
                                    on their right to take Taiwan, and proposed to take it by force
                                    if necessary. We have tried desperately to get them to change
                                    this position, but we had failed. Accordingly, this was far from
                                    a quiescent period with respect to the problem.”</p></quote></p>

                                    broken off, was it likely that the Chinese Communists would move
                                    promptly against Quemoy and the Matsus?</p>
                                <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied
                                    that available intelligence indicated no immediate likelihood of
                                    such a Chinese Communist move. Nevertheless, the Chinese
                                    Communists were continuing to develop their capabilities for
                                    such an operation, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                        >Dulles</persName> believed that they could amass sufficient
                                    forces in a matter of a couple of weeks to seize these offshore
                                    islands if they decided to do so. He did not think, however,
                                    that they would resort to force in the near future, even if the
                                    negotiations were broken off. It was more likely that they would
                                    continue to go on as they have been, although with more
                                    threatening noises.</p>

                                    which the United States found itself obliged to go to war and
                                    that he, <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>, would be
                                    unable to come to the support of the United States because of
                                    British public opinion. The President wondered whether these
                                    remarks were a backhanded reference to Quemoy and the
                                    Matsus.</p>
                                <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> thought
                                    that the President’s surmise was quite likely to have been
                                    correct. He pointed out, however, that in their propaganda the
                                    Chinese Communists persistently and carefully avoided any
                                    suggestion of taking Quemoy and the Matsus except within the
                                    total picture of their determination to take Taiwan by force if
                                    necessary.</p>
                                <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said
                                    that he nevertheless believed it likely that if the Chinese
                                    Communists finally decided to try to seize Taiwan, they were
                                    quite likely to move against Quemoy and the Matsus first. If
                                    they stopped there for a while they would certainly put the
                                    United States on the spot.</p>
                                <p>“Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> wondered
                                    whether the Chinese Communists might not seek a meeting between

                        <p>2. My general impression is that while no sign whatever any shift their
                            position, threat of break on renunciation force has somewhat
                            receded.</p>

                            <p>“The Department of State believes that the misgivings expressed in
                                the Aide-Mémoire delivered to the American Embassy at Taipei on
                                January 25 regarding the Geneva talks with the Chinese Communists
                                are unfounded.</p>
                            <p>As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is aware from the full information
                                it has received from representatives of the Department on the course
                                of the Geneva talks, the first United States objective in entering
                                into the conversations was to obtain the release of maltreated
                                American nationals unjustly detained by the Chinese Communists, and
                                some progress has been made on this item. Although Chinese Communist
                                implementatoin of the Agreed Announcement of September 10 on the
                                return of civilians in unsatisfactory, sixteen out of the
                                twenty-nine Americans who were in jail or under house arrest when
                                the talks started have been released. Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> is continuing to press for
                                fulfillment of the Chinese Communists’ commitment to release the
                                remaining thirteen.</p>
                            <p>The second United States objective was to obtain from the Chinese
                                Communists a public renunciation of force, with particular reference
                                to the Taiwan area. The Chinese Communists have given no indication
                                thus far that they are willing to make such a declaration in any
                                acceptable form. They apparently are willing to give lip service in
                                a vague general way to the renunciation of force principle, but they
                                refuse to apply it to the area of Taiwan. The United States
                                representative pointed out that a renunciation of force declaration
                                by <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0336"/>them which did not
                                include the area of Taiwan would have little meaning under existing
                                circumstances.</p>
                            <p>The Department is unable to share the view that United States efforts
                                to obtain a renunciation of force declaration from the Chinese
                                Communists, and the expressed willingness of the United States to
                                reaffirm its position on the renunciation of the use of force, would
                                in any way prejudice the interests of the Chinese Government. A
                                public renunciation of force declaration by the Chinese Communists,
                                while it would not be self-enforcing and certainly might be violated
                                by the Chinese Communists, would make renewed aggression in defiance
                                of their commitment more hazardous for them. It would make their
                                position following a new act of aggression even more indefensible
                                than it otherwise would be. In the judgment of the United States it
                                would greatly improve the prospects for obtaining additional
                                international sanctions against the Chinese Communists in the event
                                of a further breach of the peace by them.</p>
                            <p>If on the other hand the Chinese Communists refuse to make an
                                unqualified renunciation of force declaration, they are also in a
                                very vulnerable position before the world. Their unwillingness to
                                eschew force to achieve their expansionist designs and their
                                willingness to jeopardize international peace and security will be
                                fully exposed. Such action could not be reconciled with their
                                peaceful protestations.</p>
                            <p>Thus it seems to the Department that the interests of freedom cannot
                                lose by a requirement that the Chinese Communists stand up and be
                                counted on this issue. Either they make a commitment which at least
                                will hamper them, or their aggressive intent is revealed for all the
                                world to see.</p>
                            <p>The Department has made it clear that the conversations at Geneva do
                                not imply any form or degree of diplomatic recognition of the
                                Chinese Communist regime by the United States. The Ministry will
                                recall that talks with the Chinese Communists were previously held
                                at Panmunjom and at Geneva without any implication of recognition.
                                There is no reason why the current Geneva talks should carry any
                                implication which was not present in the earlier talks.</p>
                            <p>The United States is always ready to reaffirm its own dedication to
                                the principle of the renunciation of the use of force. With the
                                qualification that the right of individual and collective
                                self-defense is unimpaired, the United States is prepared to
                                reaffirm the application of this principle to any and all areas of
                                the world. No reason is apparent why its application to the Taiwan
                                area should carry any undesirable connotation.</p>
                            <p>The Geneva conversations of course have no bearing on the United
                                States position on Chinese representation in the United Nations. The
                                United States remains firmly opposed to the admission of Communist
                                China to the United Nations. The United States remains fully
                                committed to the support, in the United Nations and elsewhere, of
                                the Government of the Republic of China as the only legitimate
                                Chinese Government.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary of State is scheduled to visit Taipei on March 16 and
                                17. He welcomes the prospect of a full exchange of views with

                                        13, as follows:</p>
                                    <p>“We believe that you have <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                            >Wang</persName> on a pretty weak wicket now. He is
                                        close to being on the prongs of a dilemma if we hold steady.
                                        His choices are (1) to accept our formulation; (2) to
                                        continue the talks indefinitely with all the inhibitions
                                        which that places on aggressive action by them; or (3)
                                        assume the responsibility for breaking off the talks, which
                                        would be a considerable onus and one which they presumably
                                        are reluctant to assume. The danger which the Secretary
                                        feels that we must avoid is the appearance of extreme
                                        inflexibility. If we appeared to adopt an absolutely rigid
                                        stance, the Communists after a break off might be able to
                                        transfer a good part of the onus to us arguing that our
                                        unyielding attitude on phraseology was deliberately designed
                                        to provoke a break. We want to avoid giving any plausibility
                                        to this sort of allegation. I would characterize the
                                        Secretary’s attitude toward the stance you should take as
                                        “firmness without rigidity”. He does not feel that it is
                                        necessary or desirable for you to propose any amendment or
                                        transposition in our proposal, but you do not close the door
                                        to serious consideration of any amendments proposed by
                                            <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> which do not

                            2) on linked question whether any flexibility our position re status quo

                            is to regard declaration end in itself in maintaining status quo and

                                    I had also stated that my side already had accepted December 1
                                    draft his side as basis for discussion with only two small

                                    categorically stated, that was what his side absolutely can
                                    never accept.</p>
                                <p>“<persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said in first place,
                                    my January 12 draft requires his side to recognize U.S. claim to
                                    right individual collective self-defense in Taiwan area. I had
                                    stated that U.S. is in Taiwan area purely for self-defense and
                                    that presence of U.S. forces on Taiwan allegedly was in
                                    accordance with collective self-defense arrangements. In other
                                    words, intention my side in including self-defense clause in
                                    draft was to require his side to recognize validity of continued
                                    U.S. seizure Taiwan and to recognize U.S.–<persName

                                    this be explained as other than demand that their side abandon
                                    its position on our dispute?</p>
                                <p>“<persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> said secondly, my
                                    draft announcement proposed and he would quote ‘they will not
                                    resort to threat or use force in Taiwan area or elsewhere’. That
                                    is attempt to confuse international dispute of China and U.S.
                                    with a Chinese internal matter. As his side had long pointed
                                    out, it was entirely matter China’s internal affair as to
                                    whatever means China used to liberate Taiwan, a matter in which
                                    U.S. had no right interfere. I had once and again indicated that
                                    declaration between us should not involve any third parties, yet
                                    very draft announcement put forward my side precisely tried

                                    explained as other than demanding his side abandon its

                                <p>“As you know, I was very doubtful of the wisdom after our
                                    September 10 announcement of belaboring the question of
                                    implementation the way we did. Not with any intent of
                                    recrimination and only for the purpose of attempting to analyze
                                    the present situation, I feel that the belaboring of
                                    implementation during that period caused them to search
                                    frantically for a counter and finally strike on this issue of
                                    Chinese prisoners. However, since we have reached the situation,
                                    I see little choice but to continue to pursue our same tactics.…
                                    I think it possible that if I were to let up on the 13 he might
                                    well let up on the Chinese in United States prisons, but I do
                                    not know whether this would be a good idea at this time. It
                                    would only be good in the sense that I have always thought that
                                    the more we make an issue of the 13 the harder it becomes for
                                    them to release them, the more they become convinced that our
                                    only interest in the talks is getting the release of all the
                                    Americans, and the more valuable they estimate the 13 may be to
                                    them in extracting political concessions from us.” (Both <hi

                            importance, that they should utilize night air drops and motorized <pb

                            He further stated that he did not agree with the mobile defense concept
                            for Quemoy, and said he felt that the forces on Quemoy should be well
                            dug in in prepared positions.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> stated that he agreed
                            with the Admiral’s views, that they were in a position [of] war on these
                            offshore islands. He stated that they had an urgent need for the program
                            for “Long Toms” and requested that the delivery of these guns be
                            expedited. He further stated that in a discussion with <persName

                            stated that for a while he would hold off bombing the mainland if he

                                target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s should give consideration to the
                            worldwide aspects of such announcements. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Admiral Radford</persName> further advised that he had repeatedly
                            told the Generalissimo that he does not think that the Generalissimo has
                            a feeling for worldwide opinion, that he should try to look at the
                            situation from a worldwide point of view rather than from a strictly
                            local view. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            therefore suggested that the Chinese Nationalists stop talking about
                            these off-shore island incidents, artillery exchanges, etc. Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> stated that he understood
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s thinking
                            in this matter and would discuss it with the Gimo upon his return.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> then discussed the
                            matter of replacement training and the problem that the Chinese
                            Nationalists are facing at the end of this year when the currently
                            Japanese type trainees will have to be replaced by some 100,000 reserve
                            trainees. Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> stated that
                            to meet this expanded training problem they would need more than the one
                            set of training equipment, that they needed two more sets, particularly
                            U.S. rifles. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            stated that he would like to see the figures on this and Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> replied that he would send
                            such figures from Taipei.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> then discussed briefly
                            the status of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, stating that they now
                            have two F–84’s and one F–86 wing now combat ready. He then added that
                            his goal was to have five groups by the end of this year. In connection
                            with the Chinese Nationalist Navy, he stated that they were engaged in
                            replacing Chinese ships with U.S. ships, as fast as they could obtain
                            them.</p>

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> then thanked the
                            Admiral for his many kindnesses and stated that he was returning to
                            Taiwan in much better health than when he came back here.</p>

                                March 1, <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> began his
                                comments on the meeting by observing that “<persName

                                “My analysis their actual present position is that they willing
                                ‘renounce force’ with specific reference Taiwan if we agree Foreign
                                Ministers meeting but they would not consider any such renunciation
                                valid beyond point Foreign Ministers had met and failed achieve
                                peaceful settlement on substantially their terms of ‘problem of
                                reduction tensions Taiwan area.’ It possible they would consider
                                even such a limited renunciation not applicable offshore islands. I
                                do not consider this necessarily implies any immediate intention
                                attack off shores but only that they not willing even in this
                                limited sense bind themselves with respect to them.” <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> concluded that the
                                possibility of agreement on a declaration on American terms seemed
                                very remote. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>) In letter No. 33, March
                                2, <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> noted that he
                                had discussed the possibility of a stalemate in the Geneva talks
                                with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> on
                                March 1. “No particular decision was made except to hold firm on the

                                eminently defensible position. If <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                    >Wang</persName> should precipitate a break, we believe we can

                        <p>2. Essence of his position this morning was if we insist on specific
                            mention Taiwan in declaration must be coupled with agreement on Foreign

                            carefully coupled “liberation” with offshore islands and not with Taiwan
                            as formerly.</p>
                        <p>3. U.S. insistence on both amendments to December 1 draft is for purpose
                            obstructing issuance declaration.</p>
                        <p>4. After my reiteration our position he said there was “no point in
                            continuing this sort of discussion” and that <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> was “considering” issuance of public statement. I
                            regretted and deplored their again going to public as indication real
                            lack desire on their part make progress and asked for reconsideration,
                            but expressed willingness let public judge side preventing agreement on
                            meaningful declaration. Could get no indication when and where statement
                            will be made but presume if made will follow same pattern as previously
                            that is, issuance by Peiping with copies made available here.</p>

                                prisoners only 13 remain. “Cases of remaining prisoners are under
                                review”. No difficulty exists in case of prisoners.</item>

                                Out of 5242 students only 156 have so far returned. Chinese
                                Government have listed names of 3477 and have ascertained that 628
                                wish to come back. U.S. Government have however told them that
                                permission to return has been given to only 103 students. Of these
                                31 have still not returned. In addition 3 students are “missing”.
                                Names and addresses of all have been given to Indian Embassy. One
                                student who returned recently was a mental case and difficulty

                                Government has also taken no action in this matter and they have not
                                even given list of prisoners. Chinese Government’s information is
                                that in California alone there are over 200 Chinese nationals in
                                prison. Other obstructions are Formosa entry permits and permanent
                                resident permits. Details are known to Ministry. <persName

                                specifically mentioned in draft”. He said that Chinese Government

                        <p>On March 4 the People’s Republic of China broadcast a statement in
                            English on Peking radio which reviewed the lack of progress in the
                            Geneva talks and concluded: “Tension in Taiwan area is created by U.S.
                            occupation of China’s territory of Taiwan and its interference in
                            China’s internal affairs. In seeking peaceful settlement of this
                            question, Chinese side has already made great efforts in Sino-American
                            Ambassadorial talks. American side, however, is not only obstructing
                            agreement in talks, but also stepping up its military activities in
                            Taiwan area. Chinese side cannot agree to Sino-American Ambassadorial
                            talks being dragged out as it is, nor can it allow these talks to be
                            used by United States as tool to prevent China from exercising its
                            sovereign rights.” (The text of the Chinese statement was conveyed to
                            the Secretary in Karachi as <gloss target="#t_Tosec1">Tosec</gloss> 8,

                        <p>On March 6 the Department of State issued a press release in response to
                            the Chinese statement of March 4. The statement emphasized that 13
                            Americans were still being held in prison in China in spite of the
                            agreement reached in September 1955. The United States, according to the
                            statement, continued to seek the return of the Americans imprisoned in
                            China, as well as an agreement on the renunciation of force in the
                            Taiwan area, but saw little evidence that the People’s Republic of China
                            was willing to reach agreement on anything other than its own terms.

                            meeting, that is, would they consider renunciation binding only up to

                            The situation in the area was better than he had expected. He felt that

                                <item>Thailand, categorical assurances given by officials that
                                    Thailand would not go Communist, also definitely not

                        <p>In India, the Secretary stated, he had had two interviews with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>, one of four hours and another
                            the next day of two hours duration. Neither had been able to persuade
                            the other to his point of view. The Secretary said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> believes that the <gloss

                            eventually, and he wishes to help that process. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> thinks the United States can also
                            help by ceasing to oppose communism in the West Pacific. In that event
                            the Chinese Communists would turn on Russia. The Secretary felt that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> was primarily concerned
                            about the future of India. India’s three principal problems were the
                            internal situation, Kashmir, and relations with Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the United Kingdom the Secretary felt that there had been
                            a slight change in attitude largely because of Soviet actions in the
                            Middle East which threatened the source of its oil upon which Britain
                            was highly dependent. The Secretary said that the joint <persName

                                232–234.</note> contained the strongest expression that <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had ever made on the subject of
                            communism. He said that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> had made a very strong statement to <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> on the United States policy in
                            regard to the admission of Red China to the United Nations, and that
                            there was no doubt in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s
                            mind as to where the United States stood on that question. The Secretary
                            said that Britain strongly advocated reduction of the number of items on
                            the embargo list and that prior to the <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            talks the Department had been informed that unless we agreed to a
                            reduction in the embargo list Britain would act unilaterally. Britain
                            appeared less zealous now. We agreed to review single items on the list
                            when the interest of free nations would benefit. The United States still
                            had a total embargo on trade with Communist China and no change was
                            contemplated in that policy. The Secretary’s view was that international
                            control should be kept as high as possible but not so high that the
                            control collapses. He believes that the system will be continued
                            substantially as at present.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked the President if he did not wish to speak. The
                            President said that he actually preferred to listen. He said he had
                            several questions to put to the Secretary but that he would submit them
                            in writing later.</p>
                        <p>In summarizing, the Secretary said that things are going on pretty well
                            for us. The greatest dangers were the weakening of Britain in the Middle
                            East, and France in North Africa.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed with the analysis given by the Secretary, and asked
                            whether the United States had felt it necessary to adopt a new policy
                            since the last Communist Congress.<note n="4" xml:id="d158fn4">Reference
                                is to the 20th Party Congress held in Moscow, February
                            14–25.</note></p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that one purpose of his present trip was to examine
                            the policy in the light of new Communist tactics. He described the new
                            tactics as “pulling in the claws”; that the former policy of the
                            Communists caused free nations to unite and become stronger in their
                            opposition to communism; but that under the new tactics the claws were
                            still there. The President agreed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he felt the new Communist tactics carried with
                            them new dangers for the free world but so far do not call for any basic
                            change of policy. He said that we cannot afford to match Red “paper
                            proposals” with good money proposals. We must rely primarily on the
                            realization by rulers of those countries concerned that proposals
                            involving bringing in Communist technicians are a very real danger to
                            them. We must give them the alternative of <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326"
                                facs="0354"/>reasonable economic support. Russian political motives
                            are very apparent. We must have a campaign of education on this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that the purpose of the Geneva talks is the same as
                            first stated, namely to get American citizens out of Communist China and
                            to obtain from the Communists a statement of renunciation of force. The
                            Secretary said that he does not expect to get such a declaration but
                            sees no harm in talking about it as long as our friends understand the
                            purpose. Such a declaration is in accord with the provisions of the
                            Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States and China, and is
                            therefore consistent with both our interests. We do not intend to talk
                            about anything else with the Chinese Communists without close
                            consultation with the Government of the Republic of China. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> seemed anxious to talk with
                            the Secretary, but the Secretary did not reciprocate that feeling. In
                            answer to the President’s question the Secretary said that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> did not press for a meeting
                            between the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName>. (He did mention the offshore islands casually.)
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> gave the Secretary a
                                memo<note n="5" xml:id="d158fn5"><ref target="#d155">Document

                            subject but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> did not
                            promote such a meeting although he may favor it. The Secretary said that
                            at the time he talked with <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> was preoccupied with
                            the Pakistan problem.</p>

                        <p>After dinner at the President’s residence the President stated that the
                            memorandum he intended to present to the Secretary was unfortunately not
                            yet completed but would be delivered through Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">See

                                    >169</ref>.</note> The President said he agreed with the
                            Secretary’s statement this afternoon about the new Soviet tactics which
                            contain elements more dangerous than formerly. He said that the Soviets
                            were trying to avoid war before the completion of their sixth five-year
                            plan. He felt the present Soviet united front offensive was directed
                            against the United States in order to discourage long-term preparedness
                            and make the people feel that it was not necessary to continue arming. A
                            great danger to the United States was the Russian propaganda campaign
                            telling communists and others in Southeast Asia that if war comes Russia
                            will win, the purpose of this campaign being to create a situation
                            whereby Southeast Asia will be neutral or go communist. Their second
                            propaganda theme is that Russia will win without war. The third
                            propaganda line being spread in Southeast Asia is that in due course the
                            United States will recognize Red China.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Geneva talks the President shared the Secretary’s
                            views that the Reds would not agree to a renunciation of force, but the
                            effect on the Asian man in the street of the Geneva talks was bad. He
                            said he had no right to interfere with our policy but wanted to point
                            out the bad effect of the Geneva talks on the people.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the new Soviet policy was intended to push
                            communism forward and to break the backbone of the free world by
                            subversion and propaganda. He said he would like to be “chief of staff
                            for a short time, to map out U.S. strategy to combat the new communist
                            strategy.” He said he told publisher <persName>Hearst</persName><note
                                n="3" xml:id="d159fn3"><persName>Randolph Hearst</persName>,
                                publisher of a number of American newspapers.</note> that Asia can
                            be freed from communism without a world war but that countries occupied
                            by communism can be freed by small local wars. War can be avoided by
                            opposing communism in countries not yet occupied. He himself has been
                            thinking since the recent Congress in Moscow and hopes to be able to
                            produce some ideas not involving world war to counteract the present
                            communist program. Roughly the first idea is to create confusion and
                            trouble in communist territory to prevent them from consolidating their
                            gains. We are now trying to contain communism by building dykes, but it
                            is very easy for the communists to get over those dykes, with propaganda
                            and <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0356"/>subversion. We cannot treat
                            communists as gentlemen, they are gangsters. Containment previously
                            might have been OK, but now that Red policy has changed, new counter
                            tactics are necessary such as creating confusion behind communist lines.
                            The President said that it is vital for the United States to stay out of
                            any war by national groups armed at bailing out their compatriots under
                            communist rule.</p>
                        <p>The President said that measures taken by the free world in Western
                            Europe had been in part successful. This was not the case in East Asia.
                            The United States can strengthen its leadership in Asia by taking into
                            account the pattern of the attitude of mind in Asia. People in Asia can
                            be divided into two groups; those who have been ruled in the past by
                            colonial powers and those who have lost territory to the communists and
                            desire to be united again. It is important to raise the standard of
                            living, but this will not take the place of a) the desire to avoid
                            colonialism again or b) the desire to be reunited. It is necessary to
                            satisfy their psychological needs. If aid is not directed in this
                            direction it will not satisfy these desires. American influence over
                            Asiatic affairs has been effective and instrumental in helping 500
                            million people obtain their independence, but the President doubts that
                            present aid programs can achieve this same kind of effect. The United
                            States aid in Asia should be given more study and be based on emotional
                            appeal found among Asians who a) have been ruled by Western powers and
                            desire to be freed of all vestiges of colonialism, and b) desire to free
                            their country and compatriots from communism. He is inclined to believe
                            that the United States policy lacks clarity, determination and
                            decisiveness. The Soviets seem to offer a constant policy and therefore
                            it is easy for them to win over the Asiatics.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> further stated
                            that the core of the Asiatic problem is China, and there is doubt in
                            many minds in Asia as to ultimate United States policy in regard to
                            China. It is of vital importance that Asiatic countries should be turned
                            away from neutralism. The only way this can be done is for the United
                            States to have a firm policy towards China. One of the burdens in this
                            regard for the United States is to have to play ball with Great
                            Britain.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> said that the
                            Secretary can assure President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> that he will always remain a friend even
                            though the United States follows a policy detrimental to China. America
                            has ideals to which China subscribes. He is aware that the American
                            people will always support freedom and justice and will never forget the
                            help China received in the war against Japan but feels that there is
                            need for more study by the United States of conditions in the Far East
                            and for a stronger policy.</p>
                        <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0357"/>
                        <p>Some Asiatics feel that the President (<persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName>) will start a drive for the mainland in order to
                            stir up trouble and involve the U.S. He wishes to give assurance that he
                            will not do so and reiterated that Nationalist China will live up to the
                            letter of its agreement with the U.S. He again reiterated the need for a
                            stronger United States policy. He said he had almost guessed what
                            happened in Washington between <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>, but the people do not understand. He is
                            personally confident that Red China will not be admitted to the United
                            Nations, also that there will be no recognition by the United States of
                            Red China, but Asians are confused by gentler talk and an expression of
                            a strong policy is needed for the people.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> stated that he
                            rejoiced over the recovery of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> and his willingness to run again. The people
                            hope that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            will be able to carry out the “liberation policy he enunciated in the
                            1952 campaign”. There is nothing more forceful or appealing to Asiatic
                            people than for the U.S. to act as sponsor for the self-effort of Asians
                            to liberate their peoples and to recover their own territory. It is
                            important that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> understand what the people of Asia look to
                            him for.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion the President stated there is no way in which Asia can be
                            free of communism until mainland China is free. And until Asia is
                            cleared of communism the rest of the world cannot be freed from it. The
                            President said he had talked in general terms but it was time to work
                            out the strategy for liberating Asia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary welcomed the expression of views of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>. It was the purpose of his trip
                            to obtain those views. The problems which President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> had raised are complicated. The
                            Secretary asked that President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName> have faith that we are trying to solve these
                            problems, bringing the same spirit to bear that he had mentioned. When
                            we come up with different answers it is because we have more knowledge
                            than he about certain aspects. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName> stated that he was in agreement. For that reason
                            he hoped that they could get together oftener. If we could allow
                            adequate time for consultation, misunderstandings could be avoided.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> stated that he
                            thought efforts should be devoted to the forming of an alliance between
                            Free China, Korea and Vietnam. Such an alliance would of course not be
                            effective without the United States leadership. He asked the Secretary
                            to give consideration to this question. These three countries, he
                            stated, can bring concerted pressure against Communist China. The
                            President said it was not necessary for the U.S. to become a member of
                            such a three power group but hoped the U.S. might work toward this end.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> stated that there
                            already exist defense treaties between the United States and Free China
                            and Korea, but not with Vietnam. The <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330"
                                facs="0358"/>President also suggested an alliance among Korea, Japan
                            and Free China, but did not pursue that subject.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he was very happy to consider the questions
                            raised by President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>. He
                            said that there was no inconsistency in our policy. He urged the
                            President not to be concerned with impressions of vacillation in our
                            policy created by the free press in our country and suggested the
                            President pay as little attention as he did to what the press says.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he could not agree that Soviet policy was
                            constant, and gave as an example the visit of Soviet officials to
                            Yugoslavia which was just as inconsistent with previous Soviet policy as
                            if President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KSWF1">Senator Knowland</persName> should go to Peiping
                            on a similar pilgrimage to visit <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName>. Also the writings of Stalin which had been taught
                            as basic doctrine for 25 years were now being consigned to the ash can.
                            This was hardly an example of consistency. The Secretary said that when
                            you see extraordinary changes in a country like Russia both with respect
                            to doctrine and personalities it means everything is not well. The
                            Secretary quoted President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> as saying that if you only think of your own
                            problems the enemy has you licked before you start. The difference
                            between a free and despotic system is that in a free society all
                            problems and difficulties are exposed by a free press whereas despotisms
                            present a hard polished front which frequently hides a rotten interior.
                            This was the case with Nazism. We should not be misled but should always
                            remember that victory goes to him who can keep his nerve to the last
                            fifteen minutes.</p>

                        <p>After the conference with the Secretary, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> if he would stay on for a
                            few minutes for further conversation. During the discussion with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> had said that he was a
                            “candidate” for the job of Chief of Staff of the United States Army. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> opened his
                            conversations by asking the Generalissimo what he would do if he were
                            Chief of Staff of the United States Army to counter the new Communist
                            tactics. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> stated
                            that the solution for Asia lies in an attack on the mainland of China.
                            He did not think the time was right at present, but suggested that when
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> is
                            re-elected we start thinking about a liberation movement. He
                            contemplated military action taken by China without United States
                            participation. When asked by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1"
                                >Robertson</persName> whether he could be successful in such a
                            venture without the participation of the United States, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> stated that he had
                            complete confidence that he could. His objectives were to avoid a world
                            war, to check the advance of communism by creating confusion in
                            communist areas and to bail out the Chinese people from communist
                            control. In order to create confidence among people behind the Iron
                            Curtain it was necessary to break through the curtain at certain
                            points.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> stated that he
                            would be less than frank if he did not take this opportunity to express
                            the American viewpoint. He said that neither Congress, the people of the
                            United States, nor the President will make offensive war anywhere for
                            any purpose. We would of course, oppose by force communist aggression.
                            There was a tremendously important role for Free China to play. Free
                            China offers the only alternative to communism on Taiwan, overseas and
                            on the mainland. Despite all claims made about Red China, conditions
                            there were probably worse for the average man than ever before.

                            stated that the United States is not prepared to support offensive war
                            anywhere in the world. With reference to the statement that the United

                            that our policy is firm. We are under tremendous pressures for
                            recognition of Red China. We have resisted them all. The Generalissimo
                            said that to the popular mind the Geneva talks were a step in that
                            direction. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> said
                            that one purpose of this trip is to disabuse that idea in peoples’

                            From Secretary for President.</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. President: I spent a day at Taiwan which was relatively
                            uneventful. During the afternoon I gave President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-Shek</persName> a round-up of my trip so
                            far, and he seemed reassured that the effect of the trip was to stiff en
                            resistance to Communism in the area.</p>
                        <p>In the evening <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> presented his
                            views about present Communist tactics and suggested a policy of
                            concerted pressure by the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Vietnam to
                            “unify” their countries, possibly by “local wars”, where the United
                            States would supply the logistics but not engage in the fighting.</p>
                        <p>He was somewhat vague but said he would give me a memorandum further
                            developing this idea which I gather is more theoretical than
                            practical.</p>
                        <p>I reported on our talks with <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> expressed great
                            gratification at your attitude.</p>
                        <p>Of most significance perhaps was the fact that he did not mention the
                            subject of the offshore islands or our attitude toward their defense. I
                            also did not bring up the subject after having first checked with
                                <persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName> that the President
                            fully understands that we have no commitments to him in this regard but
                            would be guided wholly by the circumstances of the moment assuming
                            attack occurs.</p>
                        <p>From my talks with the US Country Team I think there is a somewhat
                            excessive tendency on the part of the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >Chinat</gloss>s to aggravate the situation by minor plane and
                            artillery initiatives, and I think we should try to bring this under
                            closer control. I did not find any feeling that an all-out <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss> assault was likely in the early
                            future, and on the whole I found <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName> more relaxed than when I saw him last year.</p>

                                indicated that Middle Eastern and North African problems were
                                occupying the Administration and awaited the Secretary’s return.

                        </list>
                        <p>The purpose of the meeting seemed to center upon the suggestion made by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> that overtures
                            should now be made toward a meeting between the Communist Chinese
                            Government and the Americans. The rationale of the suggestion was based
                            on the desirability of exploratory discussions toward the resumption of
                            diplomatic and trade relations.</p>
                        <p>Prompted by a reference to the possibility of the Formosan question being
                            raised, it was readily admitted that the matter would unquestionably
                            come up, but that the inclusion of <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> in any such meeting was an obstacle which ought
                            not to be permitted to intervene.</p>
                        <p>In answer to my emphasis upon the showing by the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> Government of good faith and
                            the willingness and ability to support and maintain guaranties and
                            commitments respecting Far Eastern territorial integrities and like
                            questions, <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> made the
                            statement that those were precisely the points that the Chinese
                            themselves raised in their discussion of possible negotiations. The
                            purpose of any such conference in <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName>’s mind was designed principally to show that a <pb
                                n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0362"/>meeting could develop both
                            solutions and good will. In answer to my questions he suggested such a
                            meeting could be held in Vienna, and would be attended by <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> and a Presidential designee.
                            He thought the Secretary of State would doubtless be too much
                                engaged.<note n="3" xml:id="d162fn3">In letter No. 26 to <persName

                                    >Krishna</persName>’s”. He added, “I have thought all along that

                                find our terms on renunciation of force too hard for them”.

                                reaction was that we had nothing to gain by assenting to <persName

                        <p>2. I opened meeting with prepared statement incorporating paragraphs 1
                            and 2, Department telegram 1804.<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">Telegram
                                1804 to Geneva, March 27, provided Departmental guidance for the
                                March 29 meeting. In paragraph 1, <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                    >Johnson</persName> was instructed to press the Chinese on the
                                issue of the return of Americans held in China, and to indicate that
                                prospects for reaching agreement on other outstanding issues
                                depended upon complete implementation of the Agreed Announcement.
                                The second paragraph dealt with the question of renunciation of
                                force, and <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> was
                                instructed to “maintain posture of being willing consider any

                                principles our January 12 draft”. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                    >Johnson</persName> was instructed to criticize, however, a
                                “take it or leave it” attitude on the part of the Chinese with
                                regard to their two drafts dealing with the question. (<hi

                            <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> made no attempt to meet, but
                            receding from take it-or-leave-it attitude on their October 27 and
                            December 1 drafts, stated “If U.S. still found those drafts
                            unacceptable, U.S. should put forward new constructive proposal and
                            submit new draft”. I, of course, countered pointing out by all logic and
                            normal negotiating procedures it was their turn put forward draft if
                            they genuinely shared our desire for declaration. Much inconclusive
                            fencing during remainder of meeting on point of who should submit new

                                talks off dead center, and that next move is up to us. Do not
                                believe he will submit any new draft next meeting. However I feel

                            in low key charges U.S. not carrying out agreed announcement and stating
                            if U.S. has in mind only Americans in China and does not give due

                        <p>On April 9, the Foreign Ministry of the People’s Republic of China
                            conveyed a note concerning Korea to the British Chargé d’Affaires in
                            Peking for transmission to the 16 governments which comprised the United
                            Nations Command. The note contained a proposal, made on behalf of the
                            People’s Republic of China as well as the Democratic People’s Republic
                            of Korea, which called for the reconvening of a conference of the
                            nations concerned to discuss the related questions of the withdrawal
                            from Korea of all foreign forces and the peaceful unification of Korea.
                            On May 28 the Chargé returned a reply to the Foreign Ministry from the
                            British Government, acting on behalf of the governments of the United
                            Nations Command. The British note indicated that the governments of the
                            United Nations Command were not aware of any change in the position of
                            the Chinese and North Korean Governments regarding Korea which might
                            make the reconvening of a conference to consider Korea fruitful. The
                            governments of the United Nations Command reiterated, however, that they
                            were prepared to discuss the unification of Korea on the basis of
                            established United Nations objectives. Texts of the Chinese and British

                            Southeast and East Asia, your attention must have been drawn to the new
                            economic offensive launched by the Soviet and Chinese Communists in
                            these areas. While the Soviet policy in this regard is obviously to
                            counteract United States aid programs, the intention of the Peiping
                            Communist <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0366"/>regime is to employ
                            trade relations as a means to win over the support of the Chinese
                            communities abroad, especially in countries which have accorded it
                            recognition. Our reports from these areas indicate that the Chinese
                            Communists have achieved some measure of success. My Government views
                            these developments with particular concern.</p>
                        <p>Prior to your arrival at Taipei, President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName> had, in fact, intended to take up the matter with
                            you, but time was not available for a full discussion during your brief
                            sojourn here. I am now directed by the President to present to you
                            herewith two memoranda. Memorandum A<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2"
                                >Memorandum A, attached but not printed, is entitled “A Regional
                                Economic Plan for Free Asia to Counter Communist Penetration”. It
                                reviewed the economic situation in Asia—seen in Taipei as
                                dangerously subject to Communist economic penetration—and proposed
                                economic countermeasures to meet the Communist challenge. Among the
                                measures proposed were a boycott of all trade with Communist
                                nations, the establishment of an Asian payments union to facilitate
                                international payments, the development of a regional plan for
                                economic development, and the creation of a program to better
                                utilize and stockpile agricultural surpluses. A regional conference
                                was proposed to develop and coordinate these proposals.</note> deals
                            with a regional and interregional economic plan brought into
                            relationship with United States aid programs to counter the Communist
                            economic penetration in Asia. Memorandum B<note n="3" xml:id="d166fn3"
                                >Memorandum B, entitled “Joint United States-Free China Program to
                                Organize Overseas Chinese against Communism”, also attached but not
                                printed, listed as objectives: “A. To prevent the Chinese Communists
                                from using the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia as tools in
                                infiltration and subversive activities. B. To enhance the prestige
                                of and support for the Government of the Republic of China among the
                                overseas Chinese. C. To increase the confidence of the overseas
                                Chinese in American leadership among the free nations and through
                                these Chinese to help spread such confidence to the local peoples of
                                Southeast Asia.” To accomplish these objectives, the United States
                                was asked to provide financial and technical assistance for such
                                proposals as the publication of anti-Communist newspapers and
                                periodicals, the establishment of an overseas Chinese book company,
                                the expansion of the Taiwan school program in overseas Chinese
                                communities, the establishment of a banking corporation to assist
                                overseas Chinese economic enterprises, and the promotion of properly
                                oriented Chinese motion pictures.</note> outlines the present
                            position of the Chinese communities in Southeast Asia and a plan to
                            strengthen the anti-Communist attitude of the Chinese residing in these
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>It is earnestly hoped that the United States Government will give serious
                            study and consideration to the recommendations set forth in the

                            hoping I would have constructive suggestions that would enable us to
                            make progress. I replied with expression disappointment he had no

                            objections which I did not consider well-founded; willing cooperate find

                        <p>3. Implementation was along familiar lines, he giving me three more

                            had not accounted. In my rebuttal I cited his failure give me any

                                            attack Taiwan so long as the US maintains its
                                            commitments to the Nationalists, they will almost

                                <p>We believe that this estimate is still valid. The Chinese

                                    establishment of control over the offshore islands and have the
                                    capability of launching an attack against any of the islands
                                    with little or no warning.</p></item>

                            <item>The Chinese Communists probably believe that a major frontal
                                attack on the main islands of the Quemoy and Matsu group would meet
                                stiff resistance, might provoke US intervention, and would prejudice
                                Peiping’s “peaceful” pose elsewhere. However, in the case of such
                                lightly-held and strategically less important islands as the Wuchius
                                and Yinshans, the Chinese Communists probably estimate that the
                                chances of US intervention would be slight and that <pb n="341"

                                considerably less damage to their “peaceful” pose.</item>

                            <item>In these circumstances we consider the chances to be about even
                                that the Chinese Communists will attempt to seize some of the minor
                                offshore islands during the next six months or so. However, if
                                during this period the Chinese Communists should come to estimate
                                they are achieving significant progress by other means toward their
                                announced foreign policy objectives, we believe that the chances of
                                such action would be reduced.</item>

                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ brief visit here last month, I
                            had the pleasure of reviewing with him many of the problems that concern
                            our two countries. I was particularly happy to learn from him of the
                            remarkable restoration to health you had achieved to the blessing of the
                            free world.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ recent tour through
                            Southeast Asia and Far East did much to enhance the prestige and
                            strengthen the leadership of the United States in these parts of the
                            world. Ever since the Summit Conference<note n="2" xml:id="d169fn2"
                                >Reference is to the Geneva Conference of Heads of Governments, July
                                18–23, 1955.</note> last July and particularly as a result of the
                            protracted talks between the representative of the United States and
                            that of the Chinese Communists at Geneva, there has been felt an acute
                            sense of uneasiness and bewilderment among the free peoples of Asia.
                            Certain Asian countries, heretofore anti-Communist in their general
                            outlook, have begun to waver and to veer toward neutralism. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was able during his
                            visit to reaffirm to the Asian leaders the determination of the United
                            States to continue to oppose Communist aggression and to dissipate any
                            fear that the United States itself might be contemplating a shift of
                            policy toward Soviet Russia and Communist China. I was especially
                            impressed by the Secretary’s account of the firm stand you took at your
                            meeting with <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> early
                            this year against the admission of the Chinese Communist regime in the
                                <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0370"/>United Nations. Needless to
                            say, I am most appreciative of the continued support you give to my
                            Government in this and other respects.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and I were in
                            general agreement on a number of questions discussed. We shared the
                            view, for instance, that the new posture assumed by Soviet Russia during
                            and since the 20th Congress of the Russian Communist Party represented
                            no change in basic policy, but new tactics designed for a more effective
                            Communist expansion. In fact, it should be regarded as a more cunning,
                            therefore more dangerous, phase of Russia’s cold war tactics. Soviet
                            Russia’s policy remains the conquest of the world by Communism.</p>
                        <p>I have followed with understanding the various measures you have adopted
                            in meeting the changing tactics of Soviet aggression. I am equally
                            aware, however, of the mounting crisis besetting the free world in the
                            face of Russia’s new offensive. You will, perhaps, agree with me that to
                            combat Communist aggression more effectively at this crucial moment, it
                            would be necessary for us to act in unity and concert. For this reason,
                            a frank and periodic exchange of views between allies would be helpful.
                            The shortness of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’
                            visit here made our discussions inevitably brief. I have since asked my
                            Foreign Minister to submit to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, for your Government’s consideration, two

                            Here in these pages, I propose to set forth at some length some of my
                            views on American policy in Asia in general— views that are based on my
                            personal observations of the workings of international Communism during
                            the past thirty years.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Factors in Contemporary Asian
                                Outlook</hi></p>
                        <p>The United States of America occupies a unique position in the
                            contemporary history of Asia. As a result of her efforts and her
                            influence, over 600,000,000 people in various parts of Asia have gained
                            freedom and independence since the close of World War II. More than
                            anything else, it is American political philosophy and practice that
                            have made the great majority of the 1,200,000,000 people of Asia ardent
                            friends of the United States. For the same reason, the entire free world
                            looks to the United States for leadership. The aspirations of the Asian
                            people manifested in their unceasing struggle for freedom and
                            independence grow for the most part out of the influence of American
                            concepts of personal liberty and social justice. The Asians know that
                            the United States have no colonial designs. The granting of independence
                            to the Philippines was a convincing example.</p>
                        <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0371"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName>Sun Yat-sen</persName>, himself a great admirer of American
                            ideals and institutions, advocated close collaboration with the United
                            States in China’a international relations long before the founding of
                            the Chinese Republic in 1911. The impact of American influence on China
                            since Dr. <persName>Sun</persName>’s time had steadily gathered strength
                            until the Communist occupation of the Chinese mainland. The loss of the
                            Chinese mainland to Communism was, indeed, a shattering blow to the
                            cause of freedom not only in China but in Asia as a whole. This is borne
                            out by subsequent Communist aggression in Korea and Vietnam and the
                            increasingly widespread infiltration and subversion in other Asian
                            countries. Today, whether or not freedom in Asia could be made secure
                            depends to a very large extent on the success or failure of China’s
                            effort to regain her freedom by overthrowing the Communist regime.</p>
                        <p>Political independence and territorial integrity remain the predominant
                            aspiration of the Asian people today. The fact that many of the Asian
                            countries have grown out of their colonial status does not remove their
                            deep-seated resentment against Western colonialism. Any action taken by
                            Western powers in Asia is looked upon with suspicion regardless [of] its
                            true motive. This is true particularly in matters of collective security
                            and foreign aid. Often groundless, such suspicion becomes an important
                            political factor in Asia. It easily lends itself to Communist propaganda
                            which, by exploiting anti-colonialism, seeks to turn the Asian people
                            against the West, including the United States. It blinds the Asian
                            people to the obvious fact that international Communism represents
                            another form of colonialism, even more insidious. To cope with this
                            psychological and emotional factor, the United States as the leader of
                            the free world must try to convince the Asians that, in seeking their
                            cooperation and offering them aid in any scheme of mutual security, her
                            only purpose is to help the Asian countries safeguard their newly gained
                            freedom and independence in the face of the threat of Communist
                            colonialism. Thus, it would also be advisable for the United States to
                            avoid, whenever possible, identifying its policy with colonial powers
                            such as Great Britain and France in its dealing with Asian nations.
                            American leadership, unfettered and unequivocal, must be clearly
                            demonstrated.</p>
                        <p>There exists in Asia today another equally important political factor. In
                            such countries as Korea, Vietnam and China where Communists have through
                            aggression and conspiracy come into actual control of considerable parts
                            of their territories, the over-riding aspiration of the people, whether
                            behind or outside the Iron Curtain, is reunification under the banner of
                            freedom and democracy. Such aspiration, however, has not been given due
                            regard by the free world. While this popular aspiration has received
                            considerable impetus from <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0372"
                            />American military and economic aid, the general feeling is that its
                            early fulfillment does not at present have the support of the United
                            States. The people of these countries are even tempted to construe
                            American aid as designed to perpetuate the status quo. To those
                            suffering behind the Iron Curtain, this is perhaps even more
                            disheartening. Conditioned as they are by Communist propaganda, they may
                            give up all hope for their eventual liberation. I have suggested to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> that a close
                            study should be made to better tailor the United States foreign aid
                            programs to the demands of the political aspirations of the Asian
                            people. Admittedly, it involves difficulties. But, as the force of
                            Communist aggression continues to gain ground in Asia, the need for a
                            more positive approach to the entire question of United States support
                            for anti-Communist countries cannot be over-emphasized.</p>

                                Countermeasures</hi></p>
                        <p>Soviet Russia’s policy of world conquest has been evident ever since the
                            October Revolution in 1917. The Soviet government on the one hand has
                            sought to secure its totalitarian rule at home through an economy geared
                            to military expansion. On the other, it has relentlessly pursued the
                            goal of world revolution through the operation of the Communist
                            Internationale. While its tactics may vary to accommodate the conditions
                            of a given scene of operation and in accordance with its own strength at
                            a given time, its final aim at world conquest has always remained
                            unchanged and undiminished.</p>
                        <p>Viewing the Soviet practice against the Leninist dogma of world
                            revolution, I believe the basic Communist policy of aggression consists
                            of three things. First of all, it is the guiding principle in Soviet
                            strategy that, unless its own territory is attacked or subject to
                            imminent threat of attack, Soviet Russia would invariably avoid direct
                            participation in any war and seek to preserve its own strength. But it
                            would not hesitate to exploit any conflict and contradiction between
                            other countries by means short of engaging itself in war.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Soviet Russia relies for the success of its aggressive designs
                            principally upon the use of indirect force. On the one hand, it
                            constantly resorts to infiltration and subversion to manufacture
                            internal revolution in other countries. Such activities are usually
                            carried out under the guise of political collaboration, economic
                            cooperation or cultural and technical exchange. When the time is ripe,
                            arms are provided to national Communist parties which would then grab
                            political control with force and turn the countries into Soviet
                            satellites. On the other hand, Soviet Russia utilizes every friction and
                            conflict between the free nations to create and enlarge dissensions and
                            to destroy the unity of the free world. The current Soviet peace
                            offensive featuring the so-called diplomacy of smiles is but an
                            intensification <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0373"/>of such
                            divisive tactics. In the Communist calculation, the practice of such
                            tactics is far more important to the achieving of world revolution than
                            the actual use of military force.</p>
                        <p>The third element in the basic Soviet policy is the ceaseless preparation
                            for war. Russia’s avoidance of direct use of force and its indirect
                            methods of subversion and infiltration by no means contradict the policy
                            of preparing for war. On the contrary, they serve as its effective
                            cover, enabling the Soviet Government to carry out its militarized
                            economic programs, to expand the war machine and to prepare for total
                            mobilization. Such war preparation in turn provides an effective backing
                            for further aggression short of war. It is designed also to cause
                            confusion and weariness in the free world, to place the free nations on
                            the defensive in armament race and to lead them astray both in concepts
                            of strategy and in action. Thus, at the proper moment and after the
                            indirect tactic of aggression has done its part, Soviet Russia would
                            then be in a position to deliver the fatal blow on the free world.</p>
                        <p>For more than thirty years, especially since the end of World War II,
                            Soviet Russia has been able to put to the most effective use, separately
                            or combinedly, the above three phases of its basic policy. It exploits
                            the weaknesses in the armour of the free world and devises such methods
                            as required by any given set of circumstances. Without shedding its own
                            blood, Soviet Russia has succeeded in the past decade in placing more
                            than 600,000,000 people behind the Iron Curtain and the entire free
                            world in a most precarious position.</p>
                        <p>The recent decision by the 20th Congress of the Russian Communist Party
                            to encourage neutralism and to support the United Front movement is
                            adopted as a counter action against the policy of collective
                            self-defense under the United States leadership and represents the
                            combination of the three kinds of tactics mentioned above. Assured that
                            the United States and the free world as a whole would not initiate a war
                            against it, Soviet Russia always enjoys freedom of action on the brink
                            of war. Behind the peace offensive, the Russian Government is permitted
                            to go all out in developing nuclear as well as conventional arms, in
                            carrying out the 6th Five-Year Plan and in forging Russia and Communist
                            China into one single war machine integrating the Eurasian landmass. In
                            so doing, Russia strives to achieve and retain a military superiority
                            over the United States so as to secure the benefit of initiative in the
                            next world war when it eventually comes. An important part of the Soviet
                            peace offensive is the effort to create and exploit differences among
                            the free nations, so as to weaken the enemy even before the war actually
                            begins. Its instigation of extremist activities among nationalists and
                            anti-colonialists in North Africa, Southeast Asia and the Middle East
                            and its <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0374"/>brazen act of providing
                            weapons for the armed conflict between Israel and the Arab countries are
                            only more glaring examples.</p>
                        <p>Opinion has been divided as to how best to deal with the increasingly
                            critical situation resultant from the Russian policy of aggression. The
                            free world could wait for Russia to start another global war after the
                            completion of the Soviet war preparations and then, and only then,
                            strike back in force and resort to nuclear retaliation, if necessary.
                            This policy, currently adhered to by the Western powers, appears to
                            accept the inevitability of World War III. As an alternative, the free
                            world may continue to hope for the day when Russia would of its own
                            accord abandon the objective of world conquest. This line of thought
                            seems to have gathered strength particularly since the advent of the
                            “co-existence” propaganda. Certainly, this is but an illusion. The true
                            alternative, I believe, lies in the gaining of the initiative by the
                            free world, not to precipitate war, but to create confusion and unrest
                            within the Communist camp and to induce revolution in the countries
                            behind the Iron Curtain. Soviet Russia could thus be deprived of its
                            capabilities not only of starting a world war, but of furthering its
                            aggression piecemeal as it has done successfully thus far. Herein lies
                            the only path to prevent a general world war.</p>
                        <p>As the leader of the free nations, the United States is the main and
                            final target of the Communist world revolution. Which of the measures
                            mentioned above should the free world adopt for the defeat of the forces
                            of aggression at this crucial moment is necessarily the responsibility
                            of the United States and, to a considerable extent, of your good
                            self.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">To Induce Revolution in Communist
                                Camp</hi></p>
                        <p>As stated above, it is my firm belief that to induce anti-Communist
                            revolution behind the Iron Curtain is to prevent another global
                            holocaust. But, with the captive populations under the Communist rule so
                            tightly controlled and effectively intimidated as they are, it would be
                            less than realistic to anticipate such uprisings to take place entirely
                            on their own. A program of action to provide stimulus for such
                            revolution from without the Iron Curtain is necessary if the monstrous
                            rule of Communism is ever to be overthrown. Such initiative on the part
                            of the free world is not meant, nor expected, to precipitate a world
                            war. The program, in its essence, involves only limited military action
                            in selected areas to puncture the Iron Curtain, to provide the captive
                            people with moral support and material aid, to render their revolt
                            possible and to put the Communist forces on the defensive.</p>
                        <p>So far as Asia is concerned, it is axiomatic that the Communist menace
                            cannot be uprooted without overthrowing the Chinese puppet regime. For
                            the Communist control of the Chinese mainland <pb n="347"
                                xml:id="pg_347" facs="0375"/>is the fountainhead of aggression in
                            all Asia. It would be futile to attempt to prevent further Communist
                            aggression in Asia by a policy of containment alone. In addition to
                            intensifying the political and economic pressure on the Chinese
                            Communist regime from all angles, the free world must seek to reduce the
                            effectiveness of Communist internal control by creating unrest on the
                            mainland of China. Particularly, free China must be given the
                            opportunity to achieve a breakthrough of the Iron Curtain at the
                            earliest possible moment. Once the forces of free China have established
                            beachheads on the coast of the mainland, there is every possibility that
                            the population throughout the country will rise in revolt. Caught
                            between external pressure and internal revolt, the Communists could be
                            forced into the most difficult position. Only thus, can their defeat be
                            precipitated and our victory assured.</p>
                        <p>It may be argued that such a program of action would invite armed
                            intervention by Soviet Russia, thus making a world war almost a
                            certainty. As has been pointed out, the over-riding factor in the
                            Russian policy today is the necessity to gain time. Until the current
                            Five-Year Plan is substantially carried out and until its nuclear
                            armament programs achieve a degree of success comparable or even
                            superior to that of the United States, Soviet Russia will not and cannot
                            involve itself in a large-scale war with the free world. Its present
                            propaganda campaign for peaceful coexistence confirms this estimate.
                            Even if Soviet Russia should choose to intervene in a war in China, it
                            would confine its direct military action to north of the Yellow River as
                            a matter of geo-political considerations.</p>
                        <p>The successful expansion of the Communist sphere of influence in Asia is
                            attributable, among other things, to the series of limited local wars
                            engineered by the Communists. The meaning of the lesson is clear. If
                            Communist aggression is to be actively defeated, the free world must
                            also be ready to use the same tactics, that is, to gain the initiative
                            and to take the calculated risk of limited local actions. In the
                            proposed action by the forces of free China on the southern coast of the
                            mainland, United States logistical support would undoubtedly be called
                            for. But that will be all. Direct participation in actual combat by
                            United States forces is not necessary. In fact, such participation is
                            even undesirable from free China’s point of view as it would provide the
                            Communists with material for propaganda detrimental to our cause.</p>
                        <p>The Communist regime, for the purpose of tightening its control over the
                            mainland, is at present enforcing with full force various totalitarian
                            programs, such as collectivization of farms, expropriation of industrial
                            and business enterprises and the so-called reformation of intellectuals.
                            If these programs are allowed to succeed, any vestige of private
                            ownership of land or private enterprise would be completely <pb n="348"
                                xml:id="pg_348" facs="0376"/>wiped out on the Chinese mainland in
                            another three or four years and so would the remnants of what we know as
                            liberal intellectual elements. The task of overthrowing the Communist
                            regime would thus become much harder, though not infeasible. It is
                            evident that the proposed scheme of action to carry the fight onto the
                            beaches of the mainland must be put into force as early as possible, if
                            the Chinese Communists are not to succeed, as Russia has, in reducing
                            all human and material resources to a monolithic machine of war.</p>
                        <p>The Peiping regime is at present plagued with extreme social and economic
                            difficulties inherent in its totalitarian programs. I feel this would be
                            the opportune time to turn our thoughts to a plan of action. If the
                            execution of the proposed plan is delayed too long, the probability of
                            its bringing about a global conflict could become greater. Moreover, the
                            prolonged period of indecision would also enable the Communists to
                            induce and intimidate more Asian countries, especially the neutralists,
                            into joining their camp. This would not only seriously impair the
                            prestige of American leadership, but all what has been achieved by the
                            United States in the cause of freedom in Asia would be completely
                            nullified.</p>
                        <p>It is my considered opinion that the proposed measures, in spite of the
                            limited risks involved, are in the long run the surest and safest way to
                            defeat Communist aggression in Asia and to prevent another world war.
                            Once the cause of freedom begins to regain ground on the Chinese
                            mainland under the impact of a sustained action by the forces of free
                            China, the constant Communist threat to the Republics of Korea and
                            Vietnam will be automatically removed. The possibility of the entire
                            Southeast Asia and even the Middle East being lost to Communist
                            aggression would also be substantially reduced.</p>
                        <p>There are no basic differences between our two countries in our policy
                            towards major world problems. We are bound by common interest and by our
                            common desire for a lasting peace based on justice and freedom. The
                            program of action I have here outlined is not intended to precipitate
                            another world war. On the contrary, it represents my idea of how we can
                            best deter Communist war preparation and thus prevent another world war.
                            I am not unaware that American policy at this stage cannot entertain any
                            proposal of action that may lead to war. As the leader of the free
                            world, the United States is called upon to weigh matters on a global
                            scale. But I believe that frequent exchange of views, be they divergent
                            at times, could be most helpful and even necessary in maintaining unity
                            of purpose and action. I have given you what may be called an Asian
                            appraisal of the present Asian situation. While I hope you would give my
                            views your consideration and, at the proper time, your active support, I

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> Since the visit to Taipei of the Secretary
                            of State and his party March 16–17, 1956, I have been awaiting a
                            suitable occasion to review once more with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> the question of offensive
                            military operations against the communist-held China Mainland. For some
                            time the President has been considering the despatch of a letter to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> touching on
                            this subject, and a preliminary English translation of this letter<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d170fn2"><ref target="#d169"><hi rend="italic"
                                        >Supra</hi></ref>.</note> was handed to me today by the
                            Foreign Minister. The occasion seemed appropriate, and this afternoon I
                            took an hour and a half of the President’s time, including
                            interpretation of my remarks by the Foreign Minister, to set forth some
                            personal views.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister rode with me to the President’s house. I told him
                            that I planned to talk in general terms and to avoid military details. I
                            did not mind telling the Foreign Minister, however, that I disagreed
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>’s contention
                            (in his letter to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>) that the United States could provide the
                            necessary logistic support for a Free Chinese landing on the Mainland
                            without becoming directly involved in actual combat. Only if the Red
                            Chinese forces were heavily engaged elsewhere would it seem feasible to
                            affect any such landing in South China. Under those conditions the
                            armies of Free China might well be able to maintain an important
                            beachhead, at least. But they would require very large scale logistic
                            support from the United States. This, in turn, would necessitate
                            American naval and air support for convoys, landing of supplies, etc,
                                <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0378"/>etc. It would tax to the
                            limit the present resources of our Navy and Air Force in the Pacific.
                            And these forces would almost inevitably be involved in combat with the
                            Red Chinese Air Force within the first 24 hours. However, I saw no
                            purpose in arguing this point with President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName>. As to direct Soviet participation under such
                            circumstances, he probably was right in considering it unlikely. But the
                            Soviets had various ways of giving indirect assistance, as we well
                            knew.</p>
                        <p>After the usual pleasantries, President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName> asked about our Chiefs of Mission Conference in
                            Tokyo and my most recent call on the Governor of Hong Kong. I replied in
                            general terms and then referred to the translation of his letter to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> which I had
                            just seen.</p>
                        <p>I remarked that I agreed with nearly everything he said in his letter.
                            There was one point, however, with which I believed President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> would take issue. This was
                            the rather urgent proposal that Free China be assisted in establishing
                            beachheads on the Mainland before Chinese Communist strength could be
                            fully consolidated. I noted that statements had been made from time to
                            time that the United States would never undertake or support offensive
                            war. “Never” is a long time and these statements tended to
                            over-simplify, but a fair picture of what the United States would do,
                            under given circumstances, could be obtained by referring to
                            history.</p>
                        <p>Emphasizing that my remarks would represent simply a personal
                            interpretation, I said that the present world situation was somewhat
                            like that obtaining prior to America’s entry into World Wars I and II.
                            In 1916 peace sentiment in the United States was very strong, and
                                <persName>Woodrow Wilson</persName> was reelected to “keep us out of
                            war”. Yet a few months later we declared war on Germany and took
                            offensive action. What had happened in the meantime? Unrestricted
                            submarine warfare was the immediate factor, particularly in its effect
                            on American public opinion. But on some unspecified date President
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> evidently decided that
                            the United States could not permit the Western Allies to go down in
                            defeat. This was not simply altruistic but a practical realization of
                            our own danger.</p>
                        <p>The United States presumably could have postponed its entry into World
                            War I for some time—perhaps indefinitely—by appeasement in one form or
                            another. When it seemed that the Allies were liable to lose, however,
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> determined to force
                            the issue by taking a strong line, knowing full well that this probably
                            would bring us into war. German actions brought American public opinion
                            behind the President and war was declared in April 1917.</p>
                        <p>I recalled the years immediately preceding World War II. One day I was
                            lunching at the Capitol with Senators <persName>Connally</persName> and
                                <persName>Pope</persName>. The neutrality legislation was being
                            discussed, and <persName>Connally</persName> was <pb n="351"
                                xml:id="pg_351" facs="0379"/>questioning the wisdom of it. Pope
                            seemed equally uncertain of its value as a means of avoiding war, but he
                            emphasized that the American people wanted peace. The legislation in
                            question was intended to keep us out of war; therefore he favored it.
                            President <persName>Roosevelt</persName> ’s statements to the effect
                            that no American boys Would be sent to fight overseas were a further
                            reflection of American opinion not long afterward.</p>
                        <p>The fall of France in the spring of 1940 was a great shock to the United
                            States. Perhaps at this time <persName>Roosevelt</persName> decided, as
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> had done before him,
                            that the Western Allies faced ultimate defeat without our active
                            participation in the war, and that in our own best interest we could not
                            permit them to be lost. He also determined to force the issue by
                            adopting a strong policy, both against Germany and its partner in crime,
                            Japan. Again, the United States undoubtedly could have bought peace for
                            itself, with appeasement, for an indefinite further period of time. We
                            refused to do this, and our firm policy brought the Japanese bombing of
                            Pearl Harbor. American public opinion was already largely in support of
                            President <persName>Roosevelt</persName> and this sneak attack made it
                            all but unanimous.</p>
                        <p>I had remarked earlier that the present world situation was somewhat like
                            that in 1916–1917 and in 1940–1941. But I would mention three
                            significant differences. First, there was today no large scale fighting
                            in progress. Second, there was the existence of nuclear weapons, which
                            probably served as a deterrent to any country which might consider
                            starting an open conflict. Third, the United States today had great
                            military strength to back up its firm policy of opposition to
                            aggressors—something which had been notably lacking prior to World Wars
                            I and II.</p>
                        <p>It was possible, of course, that a situation would develop in which
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> might come
                            to a decision like those eventually arrived at by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> and President
                                <persName>Roosevelt</persName> : to force the issue with the enemy
                            to an extent liable to bring the United States into war. First, he would
                            have to decide that this was necessary. Second, he would have to obtain
                            the support of American public opinion for such a policy. As matters
                            stood today, I believed that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> felt there was a reasonable chance to win the
                            cold war without becoming involved in another hot one. I hoped so too.
                            It seemed to me that the chances of avoiding at least a small-scale war
                            in the Far East were no better than 50–50, but even that prospect made
                            it worth while to exert our best efforts in the interest of preserving
                            peace. With present American military strength to support a firm policy,
                            there was at least a possibility of forcing the enemy to back down
                            without fighting a war. We must try it in any case.</p>
                        <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0380"/>
                        <p>Coming back to the problems of Free China, I assured the President that
                            we understood and sympathized with the objective of liberating his
                            country from the Red yoke. We realized that this was a precept for Free
                            China; for us it was at least an aspiration. For him it was an essential
                            article of political faith which we could not ask him to give up. But,
                            under present circumstances, it would be no less difficult for President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> to support
                            offensive action against Mainland China than for him (President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>) to disavow his aim to
                            restore China’s freedom.</p>
                        <p>At this point the President assured me that he did not intend to take
                            offensive action against the mainland except under favorable
                            circumstances. He was simply proposing that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> consider the matter. In the
                            election campaign of 1952 much had been said about liberating the
                            countries which had been conquered by the communists. After President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s reelection this
                            year would be a good time to review the question, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> observed. I remarked that it was
                            one thing to favor and hope for liberation and another to bring it
                            about. I felt sure that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> shared his desire to see China liberated. But
                            under present conditions perhaps “active containment” or “competitive
                            coexistence” would be about the best we could do.</p>
                        <p>I went on by saying it seemed to me that we were coming along rather well
                            here in Free China. If our Congress appropriated what had been requested
                            for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 57, sufficient funds would be
                            available to complete the initial equipment of the Chinese Armed Forces
                            as foreseen in 1950–51. But actual deliveries would take at least two
                            years, during which the effectivness of the forces would increase
                            greatly. On the economic side much progress was being made. For example,
                            in a comparatively short time the chemical fertilizer industry, which we
                            had been helping, would be producing sufficiently to save US $20 million
                            yearly in foreign exchange. Military and economic strength provided the
                            base for free China’s political program. The President occupied a unique
                            position as the unrivaled leader of all anti-communist Chinese. Whether
                            the future offered war or peace, the practical preparations were the
                            same: building Free China’s military, economic and political strength. I
                            thought that the next couple of years would offer great opportunities,
                            of which we should be prepared to take advantage when they arose. To
                            succeed, Free China must be ready to swim with the tide when it is
                            favorable.</p>

                                        >Johnson</persName>, April 6, the revised draft was prepared
                                    by Legal Adviser <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName>,
                                    and approved by <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> on
                                    April 4 during a review of recent developments at Geneva.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, commenting
                                    on the draft in telegram 426 from Prague, April 5, proposed the
                                    deletion of the phrase “to the pursuit by each side of its
                                    policies by peaceful means” from paragraph 1 of the draft. He
                                    also noted that the phrase “individual and collective
                                    self-defense” had become a red flag to the Chinese, and he added
                                    that the Chinese would probably continue to be unwilling to
                                    accept such language. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1"
                                        >McConaughy</persName> wrote back in letter No. 38, April
                                    13, that the Department had considered his comments but
                                    preferred to leave the draft as formulated:</p>
                                <p>“Judge <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> in
                                    particular believes it is important to leave in the reference to
                                    the right of pursuit of policies by peaceful means, in order to
                                    undermine <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s argument
                                    that we would trick him into accepting the status quo. Judge
                                        <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> also thinks
                                    that it is very important from a psychological standpoint to
                                    adhere as closely as possible to the wording of the Communist
                                    draft. This will give more substance to our contention that we
                                    are going a long way to meet <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                        >Wang</persName>’s proposition and that our limited
                                    amendments of his draft should not make the document
                                    unacceptable to him. We are willing to accept slightly less
                                    desirable wording in paragraph two in order to preserve this
                                    position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>
                                    concurred strongly with Judge <persName corresp="#p_PH1"
                                        >Phleger</persName> on these points.</p>
                                <p>“The feeling was unanimous that we could not possibly consider
                                    doing away with the specific reference to the right of
                                    individual and collective self defense. This seems to us a
                                    cardinal point, and the cession of the point could undermine the
                                    foundations of the protective commitment we seek. Our misgivings
                                    on this score assume redoubled force in the light of the
                                    importance we have attached to this provision in the discussions
                                    to date. If we abandon this phrase now after an issue has been
                                    made of it, great significance would inevitably be read into our
                                    action, with possibly dangerous consequences.” (Telegrams 1892

                                24, <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> was instructed to

                                19 draft declaration on renunciation of force. From the point of
                                view of the Department, the draft “fulfills every essential
                                requirement of the situation for each side”, and “represents serious
                                attempt on US part to arrive at a formulation which would take into

                            any invitation to <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> to produce
                            new alternative. At close of considerable give and take in reply his
                            statement our draft had not met their objections I stated their
                            objections appeared to have two aspects. First was whether draft
                            prejudiced their position and second whether declaration was to
                            constitute unqualified renunciation of force all our disputes including
                            dispute Taiwan area. Satisfied my draft fully met all objections based
                            on first aspect. However, with regard second aspect, if <gloss

                            initiate force Taiwan area, I agreed draft does not meet <gloss

                            position. To do so would be complete perversion of whole purpose of

                                    principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and
                                    sovereignty and non-interference in each other’s internal
                                    affairs, to announce:</p>
                                <p>“The People’s Republic of China and the United States of America
                                    are determined that they should settle disputes between their
                                    two countries in the Taiwan area through peaceful negotiations
                                    without resorting to the threat or use of force against each

                                <p>“The two Ambassadors should continue their talks to seek and to

                                    Sino-American conference of the Foreign Ministers, and to make
                                    specific arrangements.” (<hi rend="italic"
                                >Ibid.</hi>)</p></note> previously transmitted Dept together with
                            relatively brief statement which did nothing to clarify its obvious
                            ambiguities.</p>
                        <p>2. I avoided any specific comment and asked series of questions designed
                            to clarify its ambiguities. I specifically asked in what way draft
                            avoided prejudicing U.S. position; whether second para, intentionally
                            excluded disputes other than those Taiwan area; whether “two months” in
                            last para, was intended limit validity declaration to that period;
                            whether last para, as whole meant that FonMin conference was “only
                            practical and feasible means”; and whether “to make specific
                            arrangements” referred to “practical and feasible means” or to FonMin
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>3. He avoided any direct response my first question, saying that mutual
                            respect clause was not only “common sense” but “also” to be found in
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. In reply to second
                            question he indicated that limiting to Taiwan area dispute was
                            deliberate because my emphasis on Taiwan area and since if settlement
                            that most critical dispute could be effected without war other disputes
                            would present no problem. <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0386"/>His
                            replies to my questions on last para, were completely evasive. However,
                            “very willing hear any ideas or suggestions” I may have.</p>
                        <p>4. At close of this phase referring to his statements on
                            “procrastination” and our seeking “freeze” situation in Taiwan area, I
                            pointed out talks had not made further progress because of their
                            ambiguous position thus far on renouncing force.</p>
                        <p>5. I made statement on implementation along lines para. 3 <gloss

                                request. Telegram 1967 to Geneva, May 9, confirmed the guidance
                                provided in telegram 1943 as the guidance for the May 11 meeting. In

                                    >Johnson</persName> was instructed to note that 18 additional
                                Chinese from the United States had crossed the border into the

                                August 1, 1955. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> was
                                instructed to contrast that record with the Chinese failure to

                            they had asked for accounting Chinese in U.S. prisons, who, I could not
                            deny, desired return China, and we had no right inquire concerning
                            Americans in Chinese prisons until we made such accounting.</p>

                                <item>It apparently places two months’ limit on ambassadors talks,
                                    requires holding of Foreign Ministers’ conference, and may limit

                            </list></p>
                        <p>2. Our analysis is that Communist proposal is by all odds shrewdest and
                            most dangerous move to date. In effect it would amount to our
                            recognition Communist sovereignty and territorial integrity, leave
                            Communists free to attack <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> whenever
                            they wished with US barred from use of force to assist defense and would
                            obligate us to agree within two months to hold Foreign Ministers’
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>3. Tactics in handling this proposal should be directed toward indicating
                            that draft unacceptable and long step backward from their December 1
                            draft. You should try and lead back to our April 19 second revision<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d175fn4">See <ref target="#d171fn2">footnote 2,
                                    Document 171</ref>.</note> as basis for discussion, pointing out
                            that it covers all legitimate requirements of situation, preserving
                            rights of two sides, renouncing use of force, and providing for
                            discussions to settle outstanding differences. Every effort must be made
                            to prevent <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>’s proposal from
                            being used as basis for discussion.</p>
                        <p>4. We should be careful that while rejecting Communist proposal we do so
                            in such a way as not to furnish grounds for break, and your manner of
                            use of material in first paragraph should be dictated by this
                            requirement. We think best tactic if possible is to get back to
                            discussion US April 19 revision and why no grounds exist for Communists’
                            refusal accept.</p>
                        <p>5. From discussion last meetings it would appear that <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> has taken position all prisoners
                            both US and Chinese are covered by Agreed Announcement, but that
                            Communists are not living up to their agreement because US not releasing
                            Chinese prisoners. Attempt to get <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName> to reiterate this position. <gloss target="#t_FYI1"
                                >FYI</gloss> We have ascertained that only 42 Chinese aliens in all
                            US prisons, and while we have no final word as yet, it may be possible
                            in relatively short time to make arrangements for deportation of Chinese
                            prisoners if release US prisoners can be thereby obtained or
                            facilitated. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>6. You should again call for release of US prisoners and Communist
                            implementation Agreed Announcement pointing out their failure thus far
                            has made it difficult to make further progress in talks.</p>

                            your solicitude and your warm remarks concerning my health, which
                            prefaced your letter of April 16th.<note n="2" xml:id="d177fn2"><ref

                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> has told me of the
                            cordial hospitality which you so generously showed him on his recent
                            visit. I was glad to hear from him that you are well and in good
                            spirits.</p>
                        <p>I have studied your thoughtful analysis of the world situation contained
                            in your letter. In this period of change and ferment in the Far East, it
                            is very helpful to have the candid views of Asian leaders, particularly
                            those of our staunch allies in the struggle against Communist
                            aggression. As you know from your recent conversations with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, there are many points
                            at which our views coincide with yours.</p>
                        <p>Your Government has a unique role in Asia as the only government which
                            can contest with the Chinese Communists the allegiance of the Chinese
                            people, both those on the mainland and overseas. The American people
                            recognize the importance of that role and have contributed in various
                            ways to assure that the Government of the Republic of China remains
                            strong and independent. I am convinced that the opportunity may arise
                            for your Government to provide leadership to people on the China
                            mainland seeking to free themselves from the yoke of Communism. In the
                            meantime, I feel sure that the close and fruitful cooperation of the
                            past few years between our two Governments will continue. You can rely
                            upon my intention to do what I appropriately can to safeguard the
                            international position of your Government and ensure that it remains
                            economically and militarily strong.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe it would be in the best interests of our two countries
                            to espouse the use of force to solve the difficult problem of Communist
                            control of the China mainland. We do not consider that to invoke
                            military force is an appropriate means of freeing Communist-dominated
                            peoples and we are opposed to initiating action which might expose the
                            world to a conflagration which could spread beyond control.</p>

                        <p>I have been greatly encouraged by the growing strength of the Free World.
                            The shift in Communist tactics which this has brought about must be met
                            with carefully planned actions, vigorously applied. If we preserve our
                            faith in the ideals of freedom and apply ourselves with energy and
                            fortitude, I am confident we can surmount the challenge implicit in the
                            new Soviet posture.</p>

                        <p>There follows a summary of the discussion at the meeting and the main
                            points taken.</p>

                        <p>The Director of Central Intelligence first commented on Egyptian
                            recognition of Communist China. He pointed out that this step had <pb
                                n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0392"/>been preceded by a lengthy
                            series of diplomatic negotiations on the part of Communist China which
                            had previously resulted in the setting up of Chinese Communist trade and
                            cultural missions which virtually constituted a diplomatic establishment
                            in Cairo. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that
                            Egypt was the first Middle Eastern state to recognize the Peiping regime
                            and, with the exception of Nepal, the only state which had recognized
                            Communist China since 1950. He predicted that the Egyptian action would
                            influence other Middle Eastern states, especially Syria. The Chinese
                            National Government had already announced that it would break relations
                            with Egypt as of today.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a continuation of the intelligence briefing by the Director
                            of Central Intelligence during which he discussed the situation in
                            Morocco, gave an assessment of an announced cut in the level of Soviet
                            forces, and discussed the effect of the Soviet de-Stalinization
                            campaign.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                            the Chinese Communists were pushing very hard to complete the new
                            railways to the ports of Amoy and Foochow. To judge from photographic
                            intelligence and other intelligence materials, the railways would be
                            completed by the end of the current year. It was difficult to explain
                            the Chinese drive to complete these railroads except in terms of their
                            determination to open up the port of Amoy. Obviously this port could not
                            be used while Quemoy remained in the hands of the Nationalists. This was
                            a situation which we should ponder.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that,
                            at the last session in the continuing Geneva meetings at the
                            Ambassadorial level, the Chinese Communists had submitted to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> a new draft
                                statement<note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">See <ref target="#d174fn2"
                                    >footnote 2, Document 174</ref>.</note> on the renunciation of
                            force in the Taiwan area. In an obscure way this new draft statement had
                            suggested a time limit for these Geneva meetings. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> thought that this might indicate
                            the possibility of a renewed crisis in the Taiwan area this autumn. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> commented that
                            such reasoning fitted into the railroad-building activities he had just
                            been describing. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            pointed out that the series of Chinese Communist airfields being built
                            opposite the Taiwan area would be completed by June of this year.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he rather
                            hated to make the suggestion, but should not the United States take
                            advantage of the current lull in the Taiwan area to get out of the
                            offshore islands?</p>
                        <p>[Here follows the conclusion of <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>’ intelligence briefing with a discussion of the
                            situation in Afghanistan. There follows discussion on items 2, “United

                        <p>In the course of the discussion of the previous item, the President
                            announced that he wished at the next meeting of the National Security
                            Council to hear precisely what this Government was going to say and to
                            do if the Chinese Communists attacked the off-shore islands. Pointing
                            out that previous Council action on this problem had involved the
                            members of the Council flying out to Denver, the President asked that
                            this time the Council be ahead of the mark.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he had
                            no objection to discussing this matter, but after all, we did have a
                            clear policy to meet this contingency, and he believed that there were
                            more important matters for the Council to discuss.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> observed that in
                            recent months the defenses of these islands had been so greatly
                            strengthened that he now doubted whether the Chinese Communists wanted
                            to mount an attack on Quemoy and the Matsus. Moreover, he continued, the
                            Chinese Communists could not mount such an attack on the offshore
                            islands without attacking at least some bases on Taiwan itself. In
                            short, he believed that the Congressional resolution<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d179fn5">Dated January 29, 1955; see <ref
                                    target="frus1955-57v02#d56"><hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.,
                                    Document 56</ref>.</note> had frightened off the Chinese
                            Communists. He predicted that the offshore islands would be very tough
                            nuts to crack.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed great
                            doubt as to whether, in any future attack, the Chinese Communists could
                            or would differentiate the offshore islands from Taiwan itself.
                            Accordingly we must assume that the Chinese Communists could not attack
                            the offshore islands without a belief, or at least a fear, that the
                            United States would intervene. The President added that he wanted the
                            report he had just asked for to contain a precise statement as to the
                            whereabouts and activities of the U.S. Seventh Fleet.</p>

                        <p>1925. 1. Two hour 25 minute meeting this morning. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> opened with prepared statement
                            again rejecting April 19 draft and advocating May 11 draft para by para.
                            Said “mutual respect” clause replaces “self-defense clause which
                            embodies ulterior motive” to justify continued US seizure Taiwan and
                            interference in liberation offshore islands. Second para was “more
                            conspicuous” accommodation to our views by making it specific that
                            peaceful settlement of disputes without threat of force applies to
                            Taiwan area. With respect to “elsewhere” are there any “real and not
                            imaginary other disputes which finds China and US facing each other as
                            parties international dispute?” With respect third para should be
                            acceptable as I had not opposed holding FonMin conference and I had said
                            this [<hi rend="italic">that</hi>?] US not desirous perpetuate danger in
                            Taiwan area. “Must two of us sit here and go on talking without an end?
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> cannot be left without assurance
                            FonMin meeting if Taiwan area to be mentioned.”</p>
                        <p>2. In reply I impliedly characterized their May 11 draft as willingness
                            renounce force for two months; as willingness renounce force only on
                            condition FonMin meeting; as willingness renounce force only on

                                <p>“It is noteworthy that the Communists worked into the first
                                    paragraph of their new draft two of their five “principles of
                                    peaceful coexistence” which have formed the basis of joint
                                    declarations with India, Burma and other states. Judging from

                                    hoping to demonstrate that we reject these principles and thus
                                    harbor the intention of interfering in their internal affairs
                                    and encroaching on their territorial integrity. This would
                                    strengthen their position vis-à-vis the neutralist states. Of
                                    course, we cannot accept paragraph one without, in effect,

                                    this reason that we asked you to try to get back to our April 19
                                    draft as a basis for discussion, rather than comment in detail
                                    on the Communist draft.”</p></note> In context inviting me make

                            draft as basis discussion would “force them consider” making it
                            public.</p>
                        <p>4. At close meeting I noted Miner’s release five years after he made
                            original application for exit and nine months after <persName

                                “high Administration source” as having stated that the Chinese had
                                demanded the release of all Chinese prisoners held in American
                                jails, and that this demand further impeded the release of American
                                prisoners held in China.</note> and other press reports reflecting
                            instructions to “demand” that we release all Chinese prisoners and
                            specifically asserting they included in September 10 announcement.
                            Although my previous presentation undercut basis for his prepared
                            statement he nevertheless used some of it, making foregoing points. In
                            reply to his question as to how many, I said did not have exact figure
                            but was between 30 and 40,<note n="6" xml:id="d181fn6">According to
                                telegram 2066 to Geneva, May 29, the total was 34. (Department of
                                State, Central Files, 611.93/5–2556)</note> to which he replied this
                            was “quite big number”. I ignored his request for list of names. He
                            renewed charge on coercing Chinese apply for permanent residence and
                            Taiwan entry permits, adding charge that US born children Chinese
                            students being denied exit. I immediately and categorically denied
                            latter charge pointing out that even though American citizens children
                            were being permitted accompany parents.</p>
                        <p>5. My statement on Chinese prisoners obviously took him by complete
                            surprise, he had no instructions to cover possibility, and therefore
                            confined himself to prepared material despite incongruities.<note n="7"

                        <p>On May 23,<note n="3" xml:id="d182fn3">According to a note on the cover
                                sheet of <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 100–5–56, the
                                Intelligence Advisory Committee concurred in the estimate on May 22
                                rather than May 23.</note> in response to your recent request, the
                            Intelligence Advisory Committee approved an estimate of Chinese
                            Communist capabilities and probable courses of action in the Taiwan
                            Straits.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> concluded that Chinese Communist
                            military capabilities in this area have increased substantially during
                            the past year and that the Chinese Communists, against Nationalist
                            opposition alone, could seize the Quemoy and Matsu groups with forces
                            now in place or readily available in East China.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> confirmed its previous estimates
                            to the effect that, although policies of the Peiping regime remain
                            firmly committed to the extension of control over the offshore islands,
                            Taiwan, and the Penghus, the Chinese Communists are unlikely to attempt
                            to seize Taiwan or the Penghus in the face of US commitments to defend
                            those areas. The <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> also continues to
                            believe that Communist concern over the risk of US intervention and the
                            over-all requirements of current Bloc “peace” tactics will continue to
                            make major attacks on Quemoy and Matsu unlikely. These considerations,
                            however, were not viewed as ruling out the possibility of Chinese
                            Communist efforts to seize some of the minor Nationalist-held offshore
                            islands or of substantial harassing or probing action against major
                            offshore islands.</p>
                        <p>The estimate concludes with the judgment that a Communist decision to
                            break off the Geneva talks would not necessarily indicate any major
                            change in Chinese Communist policy, and that the chances of communist
                            attempts to seize Taiwan or the major offshore islands would not be
                            materially affected. A break-off would, however, remove one of the
                            restraining elements to action against one or more of the small
                            lightly-held offshore islands.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss> has not yet considered the
                            release of this estimate to any foreign countries.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> addressed the
                            President and said that it was his understanding that what the President
                            desired was not a review of U.S. policy toward the offshore islands, but
                            simply a refresher as to the content of this policy.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that this was precisely what he wanted— just a
                            statement in ten words. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1"
                                >Anderson</persName> said that he couldn’t do it in quite so few,
                            but would undertake to provide the essentials. He then proceeded to
                            brief the Council on the content of U.S. policy with respect to the
                            offshore islands (copy of brief included in the minutes of the
                            meeting).</p>

                            briefing, the President stated that this was just what he wanted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> then referred to the
                            recent National Intelligence Estimate on “Chinese Communist Capabilities

                            the view of the authors that an attack by the Chinese Communists on
                            Quemoy and the Matsus was on the whole unlikely in the course of the
                            next six months. There was a possibility that the Chinese Communists
                            might attack less important offshore islands.</p>

                        <p>Upon receiving word from his Embassy in Washington of events described in
                            reference telegrams Foreign Minister telephoned me to express grave
                            concern and firm opposition to US action in case of 34 Chinese now in US
                            prisons for serious crimes. He asked me to see him today.</p>
                        <p>At Foreign Office this morning Minister described shock felt by <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> at unilateral US decision to invite
                            Indian investigation whether certain imprisoned Chinese nationals
                            desired be sent to Red China. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            reaction exacerbated by absence of consultation in matter affecting its
                            interest; Chinese Embassy was simply notified of US decision 30 minutes
                            before Indians and about same time as press. (Some indication here that
                                <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> had story before Chinese
                            Embassy).</p>
                        <p>After our repeated statements that all Chinese in US who desired return
                            homeland were free to do so, Foreign Minister learns for first time of
                            34 particular convicts (their nationals) we are holding who have not
                            been given this option and who had been discussed with Red China earlier
                            at Geneva (Lincoln White’s May 25 statement<note n="6" xml:id="d184fn6"
                                >Not printed. (Department of State, S/PRS Files: Lot 77 D

                                >GRC</gloss> we would not negotiate with Reds on matters affecting
                            their rights or interests behind their backs.</p>
                        <p>Minister made important distinction between arrangement last September
                            whereby individual Chinese in US could apply to Indian Embassy for
                            assistance, unpalatable as that was to <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss>, and present ease where persons in prison would be
                            placed involuntarily under Indian investigation. (<gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> regards Indians in this case much as US
                                <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0402"/>would look upon North
                            Koreans if British should propose their investigating wishes of US
                            prisoners in China.)</p>
                        <p>Under circumstances, Foreign Minister feels no other course open than for
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to offer receive on Taiwan all
                            34 convicts. He could not agree to forcible repatriation of <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> nationals to Red China, whatever their
                            crimes, and in Chinese eyes an Indian operation would be just that.
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> therefore offers alternative of
                            voluntary repatriation to Taiwan, however little anxious it may be to
                            take custody of convicts in question, on condition Indians are excluded
                            and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> representatives permitted to
                            question prisoners together with US officials.</p>

                                        objections, the Department noted that the Indian Embassy
                                        would not act on behalf of the People’s Republic of China,
                                        but would merely help to confirm the wishes of those
                                        prisoners wishing to return to China without intimidation or
                                        undue influence. The Republic of China had regularly
                                        resisted the deportation of Chinese to Taiwan, but the
                                        Chinese Embassy had been given a list of the criminals
                                        involved and would have access to them. The United States
                                        continued to recognize the Republic of China as the sole
                                        protector of the rights of Chinese aliens in the United
                                        States, including criminals. And the Department had not
                                        given any publicity to the prisoner decision. But the
                                        Department had an obligation to “leave no stone unturned” in
                                        the effort to obtain the release of the 13 remaining
                                        Americans imprisoned in China, and did not feel that the
                                        release of 34 essentially undesirable aliens was an undue
                                        price to pay toward that end. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.,

                        <p>3. Throughout subsequent long give and take I focused on fol weaknesses
                            his position: (a) he in effect objected to US going beyond terms agreed

                            dictate U.S. should free all alien Chinese prisoners regardless whether

                        <p>4. In his replies he generally side-stepped my attacks attempting to

                            etc. However, when pressed, position he took in essence appeared to be
                            that out of many Chinese in U.S. prisons, 30 or 40 special <pb n="376"

                            desire return, these would be subject to sham screening process by
                            Indians and results would be used by U.S. to cover up continued
                            violation agreed announcement. Also made determined effort to get me to
                            acknowledge that we had first to “review cases” as <gloss

                            characterizing May 11 draft as intensification threat to use force

                        <p>We then, at Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>’s request,
                            joined him in a conference with the Secretary. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> were also present at the
                            meeting at the Secretary’s home.</p>
                        <p>After the situation had been outlined to him, the Secretary stated that
                            this was a matter of greatest importance in which the United States
                            should take prompt and effective action. In his opinion this was a
                            probing operation by the Communists and prompt action here should be
                            highly salutary in connection with the off-shore islands of Quemoy and
                            Matsu. He further pointed out that the United States Government has a
                            stake here which other members of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> do not have. He suggested that we might move under
                            the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> treaty after talking with
                            Congressional leaders.</p>
                        <p>Complications arising from the fact that the question of who had
                            sovereignty over the Islands had not been settled were discussed. The
                            Islands are claimed by the Viet Nam Government, the Government of the
                            Republic of China on Taiwan, and the Chinese Communists. The Viet Nam
                            claim comes down through the French but is also based on historical
                            claims. The French have indicated their willingness to relinquish their
                            claim in favor of Viet Nam but have taken no action legally to transfer
                            sovereignty. The French claim itself is somewhat tenuous, resting on the
                            assertion that sovereignty was transferred from the Chinese in 1816.
                            Unfortunately, the French have no documentary evidence of this
                            transfer.</p>
                        <p>The Vietnamese, however, claim that these Islands have long been
                            Vietnamese territory, pointing out historical references as early as
                            1701 to these Islands as belonging to the Court of Annam. The Chinese
                            claim is that these Islands have from time immemorial been under the
                            jurisdiction of the Chinese Empire and have been used by Chinese
                            fisherman.</p>
                        <p>The French have a meteorological station on Pattle Island which was
                            established shortly after World War II and which presently is manned by
                            six French plus Vietnamese staff.</p>
                        <p>In December 1955 or January 1956, the Communists occupied Woody Island in
                            the Paracels, apparently for the purpose of carrying on guano
                            operations. Whether any military installations are on the island is not
                            known.</p>
                        <p>During the discussion, the Secretary pointed out that we might consider
                            acting under the Japanese Treaty since the U.S. has residual
                            responsibility over all former Japanese territories. He also expressed
                            the tentative view that we could act unilaterally under Article VIII of
                            the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> treaty.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d186fn3">Article VIII of the Southeast Asia Collective
                                Defense Treaty, signed at Manila on September 8, 1954, defined the

                            get the Philippines to act jointly with us. The Secretary rejected the
                            suggestion of consultation with other <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> powers on the ground that quick action was needed and
                            the only way to get it was for the United States to act and take the
                            responsibility for acting.</p>
                        <p>He agreed, however, that nothing could be done until the facts has been
                            ascertained from the reconnaissance aircraft from the Seventh Fleet and
                            that meanwhile various possibilities for prompt and effective action
                            should be explored.</p>
                        <p>Following the meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>
                            instructed me to draft a cable to Saigon asking them to keep us informed

                            from the Islands. This was done. (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1"

                                buildings on Woody. No troops or armament observed.” Chinese
                                activity in the Paracels was “apparently limited to guano collection
                                on Woody with occasional visits to <persName>Robert</persName>,

                                    force:</p>
                                <p>“I had not intended to say much on renunciation but listening to
                                    his opening statement the mood seized me and I let myself go. It
                                    is the type of act that loses its usefulness if put on too
                                    often, but after arriving there this morning it seemed to me a
                                    good idea. It is also, I feel, much more effective when I do it
                                    obviously extemporaneously rather than reading a prepared
                                    statement. I tried again to go as far as I felt I could in
                                    holding out the ‘pot of gold’ if they would behave themselves.
                                    It seems to me this is now and again necessary if I am to do
                                    everything possible to assume that we keep going along the
                                    present lines. However, it is hard to find new ways to say the
                                    same old thing. My present feeling is that with careful handling
                                    we can expect to be able to plow this same furrow until November
                                    but, depending on what happens then not much beyond that. It is
                                    not too early to consider how we will handle the various
                                    contingencies that might be expected at about that time, but I
                                    leave that in your good hands.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.,

                            and continued threat their part resort force if necessary. This
                            anachronistic position would never be accepted by my government or any
                            other self-respecting government. Their equating renunciation force with
                            agreeing to maintenance status quo Taiwan area was doctrine of despair
                            and pessimism in effect saying some disputes could not be settled
                            peacefully. From this led back to urging acceptance April 19 draft.</p>

                        <p>The Government of the Republic of China (<gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss>) moved to the island of Taiwan in 1949 and subsequently
                            consolidated its control over certain neighboring islands. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was accompanied by an army of about
                            500,000 men, as well as government officials and other refugees.
                            Although the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> hopes eventually to
                            return to the mainland, the United States will not support <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> offensive military operations aimed at
                            achieving this purpose under present conditions. <pb n="387"
                                xml:id="pg_387" facs="0415"/>Owing to the Chinese Communist threat,
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has had to maintain military
                            forces capable of defending Taiwan and Penghu with American naval and
                            air support. The position and strength of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> and our policy toward China are intimately connected
                            with our entire position in the Far East and with our national security.
                            The maintenance of armed forces with this capability is beyond the
                            economic resources of Taiwan. Because of its basic policy of return to
                            the mainland and because of preoccupation with military problems, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has not given priority to the
                            development of a viable Taiwan economy. It is more concerned with
                            maintenance of political stability through an adequate standard of
                            living. These facts notwithstanding, some attention has been paid to
                            economic development, and progress has been made, largely as the result
                            of United States aid, but self-support is not in sight.</p>
                        <p>The best available data, although only providing a rough approximation of
                            the orders of magnitude involved indicates that completion of the
                            presently planned build-up and maintenance of <gloss target="#t_GRC1"

                            present magnitude may cost the U.S. about $300 to $325 million a year in
                            new appropriations. Outside aid will be required thereafter and at the

                                >GRC</gloss> forces will still be unable to defend their territory

                                    such common danger involving Taiwan and Penghu. An exchange of
                                    notes a few days after the Treaty was signed assured that the

                                    combat, can, with substantial outside logistical, air and naval
                                    support, perform its mission of the ground defense of Taiwan and
                                    Penghu; its capability to defend the off-shore islands is
                                    marginal and is contingent on logistic support and on air and
                                    naval support sufficient to prevent achievement of air
                                    superiority by the Chinese Communists, isolation of the

                                <p>The country of Taiwan is small, densely populated in proportion
                                    to its arable land resources, primarily agricultural and with a
                                    relatively underdeveloped industry. Agricultural cultivation
                                    already highly intensive, does not offer scope for enough
                                    expansion to more than keep pace with population growth.
                                    Consequently, growth in the per capita Gross National Product
                                        (<gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>) depends primarily on
                                    industrialization. The rate of increase (50% during the period
                                    1950–55) is expected, however, to taper off sharply, even if the
                                    present level of investment is maintained, since rehabilitation
                                    and repair of preexisting facilities are now largely completed.
                                    A rate of growth of 2–3 percent per year is theoretically
                                    maintainable in the future, assuming among other things adequate
                                    controls over consumption. Although progress is being made,
                                    certain limiting factors still exist, such as inadequate
                                    transportation and communication facilities, lack of power,
                                    certain technical skills and other resources. Other basic
                                    problems such as a population growth of 2.75 percent annually
                                    and the incorporation into the economy over the past six years
                                    of two million refugees, the tremendous burden of supporting
                                    large military forces, and a sprawling and inefficient central
                                    government still exist. Government policy has shown a
                                    disposition toward government ownership and operation of
                                    productive enterprise, including monopoly in certain cases. A
                                    Four-Year Economic Development Plan, formulated in 1952 under
                                    U.S. encouragement, has been of little substantive value due to
                                    lack of central government support.</p>

                                        <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953. Expenditures,
                                    including those financed with U.S. assistance, have grown more
                                    rapidly than revenues. The government has operated on the
                                    assumption that a deficit can be met by U.S. aid or deficit
                                    financing. Progress toward raising taxes, controlling
                                    consumption and exercising budgetary controls, has been slight.

                                    this time, aside from military and economic considerations,
                                    would, in view of the continuing threat from the mainland,
                                    create serious and perhaps critical problems in Taiwan and the
                                    area generally. As in the case of Korea, such action would
                                    doubtless be interpreted as a lessening of U.S. interest unless
                                    compensated by alternative security or strategic
                                    arrangements.</p></item>

                                <p>Taiwan’s large current budgetary deficits before U.S. aid
                                    indicate an inability, even with drastic fiscal reform, to carry
                                    a significantly larger part of the military costs. For instance,
                                    only about 20–25% of the total defense costs have been carried
                                    by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and this covers only
                                    about 60% of the local currency costs. The deficits have been
                                    largely met by foreign aid.</p>
                                <p>The fact that the cost of the military build-up and over half the
                                    continuing cost of its maintenance is in dollars, coupled with
                                    the overwhelming dependence on outside aid to meet balance of
                                    trade deficits, leads to the conclusion that, were all
                                    assistance withdrawn, Taiwan would be unable to complete the
                                    build-up, to maintain the present forces or to maintain even a
                                    greatly reduced level of forces. It would be virtually incapable
                                    of purchasing any equipment from outside. Upon exhaustion of
                                    consumable supplies and deterioration of equipment, reduction
                                    would be necessary.</p>
                                <p>The budgetary situation described above and the low per capita
                                    productivity render almost impossible any significant diversion
                                    of resources from nonmilitary to military uses in the near
                                    future without adverse political and economic

                            brought up the proposal to withdraw United States military personnel
                            from Kinmen and Matsu, which evidently was the primary reason he had
                            sent for me.</p>
                        <p>During the subsequent conversation President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName> repeated several times, with emphasis, his
                            conviction that the withdrawal of United States military personnel from
                            the offshore islands would have a most serious—perhaps disastrous—effect
                            on Chinese morale. It would be interpreted by the Chinese military and
                            by the civilian population as a new step in American policy directed
                            toward the abandonment of Kinmen and Matsu. He recalled the
                            psychological impact of the withdrawal of American Marines from Tien
                            Tsin and Tsing Tao, which had proved far more serious than he himself
                            had foreseen. Particularly at the present time, it was of the greatest
                            importance that such a mistake should not be repeated.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I reviewed the points covered in my memoranda of conversations
                            with the Acting Foreign Minister (June 22<note n="3" xml:id="d192fn3">On

                                    corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName> cited the problems
                                experienced during the previous year by the American officers
                                stationed on Tachen as evidence of the dangers involved in the
                                present situation. He noted that <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                    >MAAG</gloss> advisers stationed on Taiwan would make frequent
                                trips to the offshore islands, and the United States would continue
                                logistic support for the islands. <persName corresp="#p_RKL1"
                                    >Rankin</persName> concluded that the advisers stationed on
                                Taiwan might increase their effectiveness, while avoiding the risk
                                of confusion and embarrassment in an emergency. (Memorandum of

                                might not be entirely withdrawn until the end of the year. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> insisted that any such withdrawal
                                would have a bad effect on Chinese morale. (Memorandum of

                            reference to the potentially awkward position of the American officers
                            in question in the event of a sudden and major Communist attack. I
                            assured him that no change of policy was involved, and that it was not
                            proposed to withdraw the officers immediately—perhaps not before the end
                            of the year.</p>
                        <p>In further explanation, I said that any American responsibilities toward
                            the offshore islands now belonged more properly to the United States
                            Taiwan Defense Command than to the Military Assistance Advisory Group,
                            whose personnel were first stationed on Kinmen and Matsu in 1954 prior
                            to the establishment of <gloss target="#t_USTDC1">USTDC</gloss>.
                            Moreover, we were faced with the larger problem of reducing the numbers
                            of official Americans in Free China from the present high level, which
                            is having unfortunate effects on Chinese-U.S. relations. Beyond a
                            certain point, I said, our local problems seemed to increase as the
                            square of the number of Americans involved. Points of friction were
                            multiplied and we tended to get our fingers into too many Chinese pies.
                            I had noted a deterioration in relations between Chinese and Americans
                            on Taiwan during the past year, and I thought it was due in large part
                            to the rapid growth of our official American group here, which today
                            exceeded 8,500 including dependents.</p>
                        <p>I said that there were also practical reasons for reducing our staffs.
                            More than a year ago some 200 Americans had come out to train the
                            Chinese in using 90 mm. anti-aircraft artillery. This training was now
                            well advanced and a much smaller number should suffice. On the offshore
                            islands, the equipment and training of the Chinese forces was
                            substantially complete, as were the defense works. I could see no reason
                            for continuing to maintain nearly 60 American advisers on Kinmen and
                            Matsu. As a matter of fact we should encourage more independence among
                            the Chinese military. It was understandable that American technical
                            assistance might be needed when new equipment was introduced. But as an
                            American lieutenant colonel said to me not long ago, “Who am I to be
                            telling a Chinese general what to do?” One of our very best Air Force
                            colonels remarked to me recently, “I came here as an adviser; now I am
                            becoming a crutch.” Both of these officers are deeply interested in
                            their work and sympathetic to the Chinese cause. I thought their remarks
                            established conclusively that it was time to reduce our staffs, although
                            I <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0425"/>did not propose to do
                            anything hastily or without due regard for psychological reactions.</p>
                        <p>Not being a military expert, I remarked that I would not attempt to say
                            how many American personnel were required to carry out various
                            responsibilities, but there was rather general agreement among Americans
                            here that a gradual reduction in staffs over the next year would be in
                                order.<note n="5" xml:id="d192fn5">In telegram 76 from Taipei, July

                            but that for the psychological reasons he had already mentioned it was
                            essential not to do so on the offshore islands.</p>

                            was receiving more emphasis than it deserved. There were columnists and
                            radio commentators in the United States who were urging a drastic change
                            in American policy, with a softening of our attitude towards Soviet
                            Russia and communists in general. However, these opinions had not
                            affected the views of top level officials of the United States
                            Government, such as President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"

                                    on July 20 with a letter to President <persName
                                        corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in which he stated
                                    his concern over the “danger confronting Asia”:</p>
                                <p>“In my opinion the greatest danger confronting Asia today is the
                                    effect already evident in Asia of the ’smile’ tactics and
                                    economic penetration waged by Soviet Russia and the Chinese
                                    Communists, with the opportunist collaboration of the so-called
                                    neutralist countries. The growth of neutralism has greatly
                                    helped Communist infiltration in Asia and weakened the
                                    solidarity of the free world. In order to hold on to our present
                                    position, it is necessary to combat the effect of neutralism,
                                    particularly in Asia. Any advance of neutralism in this part of
                                    the world is tantamount to retreat on our part. I feel strongly
                                    that we must refrain from giving any encouragement to neutralism
                                    by word or by deed. I am sure that with your wisdom and
                                    statesmanship, you will continue to take effective measures to
                                    counter this new Communist tactic.” (Department of State,

                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> pretty much summed up President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s feelings.</p>
                        <p>The present attitude of the American Government toward Soviet Russia and
                            the satellites was approximately as follows: the United States would go
                            along with the idea of exchanging visits, on a highly selective basis.
                            There would, however, definitely be no lessening of United States
                            military preparedness. On the economic side, the United States would
                            attempt to meet Soviet moves on a realistic basis, i.e., to counter
                            their actions, wherever they may be, with our own actions.</p>
                        <p>With reference to United States relations with Communist China, pressure
                            is building up on two fronts: trade and admission of Communist China to
                            the United Nations. With regard to trade, Great Britain is exerting a
                            great deal of pressure supplemented by Japan’s agitation for a
                            relaxation of trade restrictions. We may expect to hear many
                            irresponsible comments by radio commentators and columnists and even
                            some of the political leaders trying to influence the United States
                            Government to soften its policy. But the position of top level
                            Government leaders is still the same as three years ago, i.e., firm and
                            unaffected by any campaign waged to soften United States policy.</p>
                        <p>In summary,</p>
                        <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0427"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ position re Red
                            China is the same as three years ago.</p>
                        <p>Admission of Red China to the United Nations would produce violent
                            political repercussions in the United States. As of today, Congressional
                            reaction would be for the United States to get out of the United
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> then requested the
                            views of the Vice President on his present trip.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President stated that in the Philippines there had recently been
                            anti-United States sentiment stirred up by enemies of Magsaysay,
                            primarily over bases. This controversy has now been resolved.</p>
                        <p>In Vietnam, Diem is a capable leader who has the support of the people
                            and who understands communism. There is no neutralism there.</p>
                        <p>It would be unrealistic not to recognize grave dangers that exist in
                            Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia and Burma. What we must do is
                            to maintain the position we now hold. We must keep our defenses solid
                            and strong, and meet communist economic and subversive activities.</p>
                        <p>We also must consider Korea and Japan. There is a subtle campaign being
                            waged in Japan by the communists, especially along economic lines.</p>
                        <p>One result of the Communist “New Look” is that if the Chinese Reds make
                            one aggressive move all the world opinion would be mobilized against
                            them. The basis for a holding action is the hope that the Chinese
                            communists will make a mistake. All communists are now on trial,
                            because, if one of them should do something contrary to the “New Look”,
                            world opinion would be against him.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President requested President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName>’s views of conditions on the Mainland since the
                            Communist “New Look”, and any questions he might have in regard to our
                            policy in the Far East or in general.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> asked, with
                            reference to the “New Look” and putting the Communists on trial, would
                            the United States take action in the event of Communist aggression?</p>
                        <p>The Vice President replied that we would live up to our treaty
                            obligations. In the event of clear-cut aggression, there would be strong
                            support in the United States to oppose that aggression. With reference
                            to Kinmen and Matsu, these islands are not covered by treaty, but a
                            strong attack launched now would more likely be considered a threat to
                            Taiwan than formerly, since the “New Look” pinpoints any aggression and
                            makes it more apparent. (At this point the Foreign Minister observed
                            that the final decision in regard to the offshore islands must be taken
                            by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            himself.)</p>
                        <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0428"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> requested that his
                            following views be conveyed to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>: In our present holding operations it is
                            imperative that the United States should remain firm and not yield any
                            ground on any front in Asia. It is only thus that we can maintain our
                            friends in the Far East. By not giving in we may be able to prevent war.
                            Retreating, even a little, would result immediately in war.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President stated that that was his position in the Security
                            Council a year and a half ago. In his view the time is past when we can
                            give up even a little territory.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> stated that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> has often said
                            that war comes about by miscalculation. Any indication from Washington
                            that the United States is even contemplating softening its policy will
                            encourage Communists to miscalculate, and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> hoped that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> would give this matter
                            adequate attention. The United States has just barely maintained the
                            situation in the Far East during the past two years by giving the
                            impression the United States would strike back against aggression. If
                            now we give the impression that we will negotiate and compromise, the
                            Communists will test our intentions by some aggressive action. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> said that he was
                            convinced of the importance of what he had just said and asked that it
                            be transmitted to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>. He added that this was not just applicable
                            to Kinmen and Matsu but to the entire Far East.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then said that if the Communists should take over in
                            Indonesia, for example, it might start a chain reaction. He cited this
                            as an example of testing us out.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> stated that he had
                            another very important observation which was also to be conveyed to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>. There are
                            many overseas Chinese in the various countries of Asia. They are very
                            important in the economy of all of those countries. Most of the leaders
                            in these Chinese communities have been for many years closely associated
                            with government officials where they reside. The best way to stop
                            Communist infiltration is to keep these Chinese leaders on our side. In
                            recent months he has been alarmed by the inroads made by the Communists
                            in Chinese schools in Burma, Thailand, and Indonesia, and other
                            countries of Southeast Asia. American economic aid should be directed to
                            help the economic well-being of these Chinese communities. He hoped that
                            some arrangement could be made to divert United States aid to overseas
                            Chinese communities in order to insure their security. The President
                            mentioned two memoranda<note n="3" xml:id="d193fn3">Presented to the
                                Department under cover of a letter from Foreign Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> to Secretary <persName

                                    >Document 166</ref>. The memoranda are not printed but are

                                    target="#d166fn3">3, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi></ref></note>
                            prepared at his direction for the American <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401"
                                facs="0429"/>Government suggesting methods to counteract this kind
                            of infiltration. He requested these two memoranda so that our experts
                            could work out details together. He said that as it is, the United
                            States is getting the value of $1.00 for each $2.00 spent in aid; by
                            working through Chinese communities we could get $2.00 value for each
                            $1.00 spent.</p>
                        <p>At this point the Vice President mentioned the problem of working with
                            the governments where these Chinese communities live. The Foreign
                            Minister pointed out that it was not their intention that the leaders of
                            these communities should be used as agents. He said Thailand was flooded
                            by Chinese Communist goods. These same articles can be made on Taiwan at
                            the same price but of better quality. He recommended that such trade be
                            for propaganda purposes rather than as a commercial enterprise, thus
                            countering Communist infiltration.</p>
                        <p>Madame <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> added that in this
                            way Taiwan would be dealing with the overseas Chinese rather than having
                            them deal with the Communists.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President considered this an imaginative proposal and would look
                            into it.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that overseas communities are uncertain about
                            the United States attitude. They want to be sure. Chinese businessmen in
                            Thailand have little business because of inability to get Chinese
                            products. He considered it important that they be supplied with
                            commodities so that they might stay in business and remain strong
                            supporters of this (<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>) government.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President asked about the current situation in Communist China
                            as President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> would be
                            much interested in President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName>’s estimate.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> said the situation
                            there depends on how much support the Government receives from the
                            people, and the effect of the Communist “New Look”. The Chinese
                            Communists, like the Russians, are putting on a “New Look” on the
                            Mainland as well as towards outside countries. The “New Look” has
                            advantages for us in the free world. The main reason for shifting policy
                            internally is that it was found that the Communists could no longer keep
                            the people under their thumb. Six years ago, if the Communists had come
                            out with the “New Look”, it would have been more effective than now. The
                            recent peace overtures by the Communists mean that the people on the
                            Mainland realise that Taiwan has strength.</p>
                        <p>In explanation of these remarks President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName> stated that the National Peoples Conference and
                            various cultural conferences had ended in general criticism of thought
                            control. The more Communists try to cover up faults, the more
                            dissatisfied the people become. The “New Look” internally can only
                            result in exposure of Communist <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0430"
                            />weaknesses but cannot give freedom to the people. The principal reason
                            why the Communists adopted the “New Look” was that they could no longer
                            retain support of the people. As long as this Government (<gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>) exists and makes progress, and the
                            United States and China stick together, the Communists on the Mainland
                            will not be able to succeed in what they are doing. This he can
                            guarantee. He has told American friends often that the core of all Asian
                            problems centers on the Chinese Mainland. Today the anti-communist front
                            in Asia is being supported by depriving Red China of membership in the
                            United Nations. Once Red China is admitted to the United Nations the
                            entire anti-communist front in Asia will collapse.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President inquired how President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName> felt about trade with Communist China and visits
                            to Communist China.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> stated that no
                            useful purpose is served either by trade or visits to Communist
                            China.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President inquired whether the lowering of trade barriers would
                            have the same effect as admission of Red China to the United
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> stated that the
                            effect would be approximately the same and would be bad. The Geneva
                            talks were in the same category. The Chinese Communists are using trade
                            for their own purposes and are making progress in this regard.</p>
                        <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> stated that
                            he was concerned about these developments, and that time was not really
                            on our side. He cited the Communist education of youth, the result of
                            which would be a new generation of Communists in a very short time, and
                            asked whether the President shared this view.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> stated that in
                            another five years, the situation would be incorrigible. For example, a
                            five year old child entering school in 1949 would be of almost
                            university age when the return to the Mainland occurs. He was confident
                            of ultimate victory, but this was the thing that worried him most.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then stated his understanding of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>’s position as follows: (1) The
                            “New Look” was due to necessity but was dangerous; (2) the United States
                            should not change its policy.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> stated that the
                            Chinese Mainland is Soviet Russia’s greatest capital asset. He believed
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> would
                            agree that the loss of the Mainland was responsible for many liabilities
                            that have developed for us. The China Mainland is of great importance to
                            the Soviets. What he has said is his personal opinion and he has not
                            always been right. He has no intention of getting the United States
                            involved or of damaging its position. His only purpose is to strengthen
                            the position of the United States in Asia. He hoped <pb n="403"
                                xml:id="pg_403" facs="0431"/>that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> would accept his views of
                            the importance of the Mainland, as he is in a position to judge this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President stated that President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName>’s opinion was most helpful, and felt that the
                            Chinese Communists were under the complete discipline of Soviet
                            Russia.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> said that Soviet
                            Russia maintains monolithic control. There were differences between Red
                            China and Soviet Russia prior to Stalin’s death. Now a Tito-like
                            movement is not possible. The present system is much tighter for the
                            Chinese Communists than formerly. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> has filled all the cracks between Russia and
                            Red China and the relationship now is closer. There is less control over
                            the people since Stalin’s death than formerly, but there is more
                            solidarity among Communist countries. This makes our position more
                            difficult than before.</p>
                        <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> then stated
                            that dictatorships, when they loosen controls, may set free forces that
                            will destroy them. His guess was that eventually the Soviet Russian
                            regime would have to revert to purges in order to remain in power.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> expressed the
                            opinion that in another three years the pendulum would swing that
                            way.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President stated that meanwhile all we can do is to hold the
                            line.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> said that this
                            depended upon the United States and China; these two countries
                            primarily. In conclusion, he said that the United States and Free China
                            are so closely related that they must share the same fate. The most
                            urgent problem is to work together to prevent Red China getting into the
                            United Nations. He expressed the hope that the Vice President would
                            emphasize this to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>. If Red China is admitted to the United
                            Nations the cause of freedom in Asia is lost.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President stated that there was no question as to where he
                            stands on this issue.</p>
                        <p>At this point Madame <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> stated
                            that she concurred in the necessity of maintaining the status quo in
                            Asia but that this meant that we could not stand still. No method has
                            yet been found for combatting Communist infiltration by trade and
                            propaganda.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President agreed that we cannot be static but must find
                            imaginative ways to combat Communist activity. This is a difficult
                            problem. With regard to the admission of Communist China to the United
                            Nations there is no question where we stand. Pressure on us will
                            increase for United Nations admission and trade with Communist China.
                            The United States will resist pressure in these directions. He was
                            confident that we will continue to take a strong stand. He also
                            mentioned that we should always consider the possibility that our
                            enemies might make mistakes. The “New Look” presents us with <pb n="404"
                                xml:id="pg_404" facs="0432"/>a difficult situation; it may result in
                            forcing the Reds to institute repressive measures at home, and after a
                            while the smile will be replaced by aggressive action abroad with
                            adverse reactions. The Communists are playing with fire with the “New
                            Look”. They will eventually make mistakes but we should not count on
                            this.</p>

                        <p>20. 1. One hour fifteen minutes meeting today. I opened with prepared
                            statement emphasizing mutuality my April 19 draft and charging him with
                            “haggling and bargaining” over Taiwan area reference by establishing
                            preconditions for its inclusion. Ended with hope that we could at least
                            move in direction April 19 draft.</p>
                        <p>2. He replied with prepared statement along lines <persName

                                June 28, summarized in telegram 5 from Hong Kong, July 4. According
                                to this summary, <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> referred
                                to the Geneva talks as confirmation of the international position of
                                the People’s Republic of China, and added that it was becoming more
                                difficult to ignore China’s views in the settlement of major
                                international disputes while the United States was holding talks
                                with the People’s Republic of China. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.,
                                611.93/7–456)</note> with emphasis on stalling charges. “Any
                            announcement must be capable relaxation and elimination tension Taiwan
                            area instead of perpetuating status quo US occupation.” Aim of US has
                            always been secure announcement advantageous solely to US and failing
                            such attempt indefinitely drag out these talks. Cannot agree these talks
                            being used as “tool” by one party, continuation must be advantageous
                            both sides.</p>
                        <p>3. During give and take I kept coming back to April 19 draft, pointing
                            out mutual advantage as first step peaceful resolution and renewing
                            charge they unwilling make unconditional renunciation force as first
                            step.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> replied that it did not
                            appear positions two sides likely come closer together on renunciation
                            declaration, and therefore unless at next meeting I had new constructive

                                    >Johnson</persName> stated that he did not believe <persName

                                trade embargo item presaged an early break in the talks, but was
                                rather a renewed attempt to put pressure on the United States. (<hi

                        <p>5. I made no direct reply to his suggestion but pointed out inference his
                            government was rejecting unconditional renunciation of force and while I
                            discouraged at their attitude felt issues too important for despair and
                            still hopeful his government would adopt this generally acceptable

                                >Gordon</persName></hi>: I refer to your letter of July 10,
                                1956,<note n="2" xml:id="d195fn2">Not found.</note> informing me of
                            plans to deploy the 17th tactical Squadron (Matador) to Japan during the
                            third quarter Fiscal Year 1957 and also to rotate a flight of this
                            squadron to Taiwan on a TDY basis. The views of the Department of State
                            as to the advisability of these scheduled deployments from a political
                            standpoint are requested.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Japan, you state that nuclear components would not
                            accompany the deployment of a Matador squadron.… In view of the extreme
                            Japanese sensitivity to the introduction of any new weapon having a
                            nuclear potential, however, and the increased desire of the Japanese for
                            prior consultation on any United States plans or programs which might
                            arouse public opposition, I believe it is essential that we consult with
                            appropriate officials of the Japanese Government before implementing
                            plans for the deployment of a Matador squadron to Japan. If you concur,
                            I suggest that we send a joint message to Tokyo requesting Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> and General
                                <persName>Lemnitner</persName> to discuss this matter with senior
                            officials of the Japanese Government in order to elicit their reactions.
                            The number of such officials, of course, would be kept to an absolute
                            minimum.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the possible rotation of a Matador flight … I believe
                            that on balance this would have a favorable political effect. Apart from
                            enhancing the defensive capabilities of the Republic of China and giving
                            a timely boost to morale on Taiwan, such deployment would serve as a
                            reminder to other nations that the United States is determined to stand
                            by its commitments to the Government of the Republic of China. This
                            would hearten our Asian Allies in their resistance to Communist
                            expansion and would aid in the achievement of our policy objectives in
                            the area. From the standpoint of policy, therefore, we strongly favor
                            this contemplated rotation of a Matador flight to Taiwan, whether from
                            Japan or from Okinawa, and we should be prepared to enter into
                            negotiations with the Government of the Republic of China to implement
                            it whenever required. We consider that the advantages to the <gloss

                            this requirement, as you are aware, lies in the fact that photographic
                            coverage of air fields and supply installations, by indicating
                            comparative activity, will furnish the critical indications which must

                            Commander-in-Chief, Pacific, because of the obvious international
                            complications and threat to his mission which would arise from
                            compromise. The Department of Defense, therefore, requests the
                            concurrence of the Department of State in the assignment of these
                            aircraft in order that the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific, may fulfill the
                            deep penetration portion of his intelligence mission. Defense Department
                            action to deliver the deep penetration RB–57 planes is being deferred

                                    July 19, the Department outlined its opposition to discussion of
                                    the trade control item, stating that “we must maintain our
                                    fundamental position that there can be no fruitful discussion of
                                    this item under the overhanging threat of use of force; that
                                    there must be a meaningful agreed announcement by parties
                                    renouncing force before trade embargoes can be usefully
                                    discussed”. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> was
                                    instructed to point out that it was unrealistic to think that
                                    any country would help to strengthen another country which
                                    threatens to use force if its demands are not met. (<hi

                                    additional insight on the Department’s position on the trade
                                    control item:</p>
                                <p>“You will see that we are taking a strong line in refusing to
                                    discuss trade controls in the absence of a renunciation of
                                    force. It is substantially the position you took last November,
                                    and the position you recommended in your comments on the last
                                    meeting. We debated for some time whether we should also state
                                    that discussion of trade or any other practical matter would
                                    additionally be contingent on full Chinese Communist compliance
                                    with the agreed announcement. We somewhat reluctantly decided
                                    not to put this in, for tactical reasons. At the same time you
                                    will understand that this second condition, although not to be
                                    expressed by you at this time, still stands. If they should
                                    agree to renounce force, we would then point out that they would
                                    have to make good on their commitment of September 10 before we
                                    could go on to any other practical matter at issue.” (<hi

                                <p>“We believe it is important at the coming meeting to protest the
                                    prolonged failure of Communists to implement the agreed
                                    announcement on return of Americans. Point out agreement made
                                    more than 10 months ago, return was to be expeditious, and that
                                    90 days had even been discussed as a limit of time. Point out
                                    our full compliance in letter and spirit with announcement, and
                                    our recent action in arranging for deportation of Chinese in
                                    prison, although they not covered by announcement. Point out
                                    that this U.S. decision made in light Communist repeated claims
                                    that they included so that there could be no possible basis for
                                    Communist continued refusal to release U.S. prisoners. Point out
                                    difficulty in making arrangements for exercise by prisoners of
                                    choice of repatriation and for participation by Indian Embassy;
                                    incomprehensible failure of Indian Embassy to cooperate due to
                                    request by Communists that it do not do so. Point out difficulty
                                    of making progress toward further agreements when those already

                        <p>President: Admiral, you used to visit the Far East at the end of every
                            year. Is there any special mission which caused your visit at this time
                            of the year?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>: I came over expressly
                            for the inauguration ceremony of the Naval Air Station at Cubi Point,
                            P.I. Since I am already in this part of the world, I feel that I should
                            take advantage of this opportunity to visit also the other allies in the
                            Far East. Apart from this, I have no other mission to perform.</p>
                        <p>President: What is the latest United States policy toward the
                            communists?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>: The United States does
                            not intend to initiate any military action against the communists. On
                            the other hand, we will not permit the communists to start any
                            aggression anywhere. For example, if the communists tried to invade
                            Thailand, the United States, based on her commitments arising out of the
                            South East Asia Treaty Organization, would offer armed support to
                            Thailand.</p>
                        <p>President: I have recently dispatched a letter<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d198fn2"><ref target="#d169">Document 169</ref>.</note> to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, suggesting
                            plans to puncture the iron curtain. I should like to hear your views,
                            Admiral.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>: At the present, we
                            cannot start a war. Even if there is necessity of war, we must make the
                            communists bear the responsibility of starting the war.</p>
                        <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0440"/>
                        <p>President: My plan does not directly involve the United States. Its chief
                            aim is to keep alive and strengthen the anti-communist movements on the
                            mainland, so that they can be ready when the opportune moment comes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>: In the eyes of the
                            outside world, any military action conducted by the armed forces of the
                            Republic of China will be regarded as having United States sponsorship.
                            After all, the Chinese armed forces must rely on United States for
                            equipment, ammunition and other supplies.</p>
                        <p>President: If the United States could encourage the peoples behind the
                            iron curtain to rise up against their communist rulers, it will be
                            something similar to the United States policy of liberating the captive
                            nations. The communists have announced their “New Look” policy for the
                            time being. Neither the Soviet Russians nor the Chinese Communists would
                            want to appear to start any war within the next three to five years. We
                            should pick on the enemy’s weak points and make use of this opportune
                            moment to instigate and sustain anti-communist movements behind the iron
                            curtain. The United States does not have to participate directly, but
                            she should not hinder other nations in their actions to liberate their
                            own peoples. Please tell President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> that if we do not make use of the chance this
                            time, the chance may never come again. It is no use having a policy of
                            liberation and taking no actions now. The real purpose of giving aid to
                            other nations will also be lost.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>: The anti-communist front
                            line of the United States is a huge link stretching from the North Pole
                            to the Pacific. Along this front line, the United States maintains
                            treaties of alliance with many allied nations. If action is intended
                            anywhere along the line which needs American concurrence and support,
                            the United States must consider the opinions of the other related allied
                            nations. The United States maintains many military bases in various
                            Asian and European countries. If she acted against the will of these
                            allied nations, I am afraid it would affect the maintaining of American
                            military bases in those countries. As to clandestine activities behind
                            the enemy lines, the United States has supported The Republic of China
                            in parachuting a small number of persons to the interior of the Chinese
                            mainland for sabotage activities. Owing to the tight control of the
                            Chinese Communists, such activities have not been successful.</p>
                        <p>President: I feel the attitude of the United States in extending aid to
                            other countries tends to be rather subjective. I do not question for a
                            minute the value and propriety of the United States aid, but I do feel
                            the methods can be improved. United States aid might be used much more
                            effectively if you could be more objective and listen more to the
                            opinion of the local people.</p>
                        <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0441"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName>: What the President means
                            is that United States aid to China should be geared to our final
                            objective of recovering the Chinese mainland.</p>
                        <p>President: If we do not have an objective and a plan for counterattack,
                            there is no significance in our being here in Taiwan. We shall certainly
                            ask for your concurrence when the moment comes for us to implement any
                            plan, but you must first agree to the principle underlining any plan of
                            counterattacking the mainland. Indefinite waiting with no plan will
                            seriously affect the morale of our troops and people.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>: I completely understand
                            and agree with the President’s ideas. But if you were in President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s position, Mr.
                            President, you would perhaps agree to the two factors that must be
                            considered: (1) Most of the American people are descendants from
                            European countries, thus their sentiment is unavoidably pro-European.
                            (2) From a military point of view, without the cooperation of her allies
                            in Europe, United States cannot single-handedly start any war. At the
                            present moment, simply by agreeing to your starting any military action
                            will draw criticism, if not objection, from many other allies, both in
                            Europe and Asia.</p>
                        <p>President: I do not think other allied nations can accuse you, as long as
                            the United States does not directly participate in the actions.</p>
                        <p>Madame: At least we should let the people on the mainland know that the
                            purpose of the United States aid to the Republic of China is not to
                            defeat our final objective of liberating the mainland. In other words,
                            the purpose of aiding Taiwan is not just to defend Taiwan.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>: This is exactly the
                            United States policy toward China, only that we cannot express it in
                            your way. Frankly speaking, there are still many countries in the world
                            who are against your going back to the mainland. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> often has to defend the
                            action of the United States Government in continuing its aid to Taiwan.
                            If President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> openly
                            supports any plan for you to counterattack the mainland, I am afraid it
                            will seriously affect his re-election. I would like to list two points
                            for your attention, Mr. President: (1) If it is for the mere purpose of
                            defending Taiwan only, the present strength and magnitude of the armed
                            forces now on Taiwan already far exceed the needs. (2) Under the present
                            world opinion, no United States President can afford to openly support
                            your counterattacking the mainland. Even many of your good friends in
                            the United States Congress would not advise the United States President
                            to do so.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of giving aid to other countries is to produce enough
                            strength with which they can resist aggression.</p>
                        <p>I have often traveled around the world, observing in first hand the
                            political and military situations of different countries. I would be <pb
                                n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0442"/>unfaithful to you, Mr.
                            President, if I did not tell you the true facts and my honest
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>President: I do not ask for any commitments from the United States. What
                            I hope for is that you do not object and hinder our final objective of
                            counter-attacking the mainland. The current public opinion, particularly
                            in Hongkong, feels that the United States is restricting our
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>The report about the possible reduction of the United States armed forces
                            will have a most unfortunate impact upon Asia. If you are to announce
                            your reduction without offering instead some suitable guarantee of your
                            liberation policy, the peoples in Asia, particularly the intellectuals,
                            will tend to believe in the Chinese Communist propaganda line—that the
                            United States is following the Soviet Union in disarming, and the next
                            step will be the abandoning of the United States overseas bases.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>: In Asia, most of the
                            United States Army units are stationed in Korea. There are no United
                            States troops in Taiwan, neither is there any need for United States to
                            station troops in Japan. Soviet Union was not the first one to reduce
                            the number of ground troops. Three years ago, shortly after the Korean
                            armistice, the United States reduced 700,000 men from its armed forces.
                            We should never overlook the fact that our fire power has been on the
                            increase. And, if countries like Japan and Germany, where United States
                            troops are stationed, formally demand the withdrawal of the United
                            States troops, we have no reason to refuse. The United States ground
                            forces in Europe can be replaced by the ground forces of the European
                            countries, while United States atomic weapon units will remain to
                            support them. Some people have the wrong conception that the United
                            States is going to reduce all of her overseas forces. As a matter of
                            fact, the United States Government has not announced any plan to reduce
                            her armed forces. Come what may, we will keep on strengthening our Air
                            Force and Naval bases overseas, and our fire power will be even greater
                            than ever. If the communists think we are reducing our strength and dare
                            try to find out, they will be committing a serious mistake.</p>
                        <p>President: I would like to summarize our talk into the following three
                            points: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The Soviet “New Look” may expose her weak points and trap her
                                    in her own device. It is unlikely now that she will start a war

                        <p>The Asian problem boils down to the problem of the Chinese Communists on
                            the mainland. If we can uproot the Chinese Communist regime within two
                            to three years, the Soviet Russians will then be deprived of their
                            biggest capital asset, consequently they cannot start any major war. To
                            uproot the Chinese Communists, it is not necessary to increase United
                            States aid, nor would the United States be involved in a war. We can
                            devise some economical ways and means to achieve it. I do hope the
                            United States aid will support a plan with the liberation of the Chinese
                            mainland as its final objective. If it meets with your President’s
                            approval, we can discuss the details. For example, two years ago we
                            requested 30,000 parachutes. The request was subsequently reduced to
                            10,000 parachutes. The cost would not have been much, but they would be
                            very useful in our counterattack action. Unfortunately, the United
                            States Government did not agree to that request.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>: Airborne operation of
                            such magnitude needs proper logistic support, as well as complete air
                            superiority. The large amount of long-range air transports needed for
                            such operation will be difficult to acquire. It will be very difficult
                            to push such plans for the time being.</p>
                        <p>President: We shall drop the men at places where enemy’s strength is the
                            weakest. They will subsist on the land, needing no outside supplies.
                            About 100 men will be dropped everytime to occupy neighboring cities,
                            and soon we shall be able to control vast areas.</p>
                        <p>My basic concept for counterattacking the Chinese mainland is as follows:
                            (1) Uprising movements on the mainland must be instigated within the
                            next three years. Otherwise, success will be even more difficult. (2) As
                            soon as there are uprising movements on the mainland, help can be sent
                            from the outside. I hope the United States would help to realize this
                            plan. In its implementation the United States will not be involved.</p>

                            include any direct landing operation on the mainland coast, the United

                            “real” attitude is on the question of American correspondents visiting
                            Red China. I told Mr. <persName>Sulzberger</persName> that as far as I
                            knew there is no difference between the official prohibition against any
                            American citizen travelling to Red China and the sentiment in the
                            Administration. Mr. <persName>Sulzberger</persName> pointed out that
                            undoubtedly of the fifteen who apparently have been invited by Peiping,
                            there will be one or more who may accept regardless of passport
                            restrictions. If they did what would the Department’s attitude and
                            action be? I said I believed that the holder of the passport who would
                            violate the regulations governing it might subject himself to the loss
                            of his passport but that this undoubtedly would have to be decided when
                            the case arose. He said that obviously the problem of what to do placed
                            a newspaperman in a difficult position because there is undoubtedly a
                            most interesting story to be obtained. He said he was particularly eager
                            to visit Ulan, Bator, and Lhasa, and other points in western China.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. <persName>Sulzberger</persName> that a great many
                            correspondents, including members of the staff of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >New York Times</hi>, for months past had been eager to undertake
                            such an assignment. He pointed out that now, however, Peiping had
                            actually issued an invitation to do so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sulzberger</persName> also said he had visited President

                            had raised the question. He indicated that the President had not given
                            any firm indication of what Mr. <persName>Sulzberger</persName> should
                                do.<note n="4" xml:id="d199fn4">See the memorandum <ref

                            violation of the publicized policy of this Government in his case would

                        <p>There is no doubt that the present Chinese invitation will be most
                            tempting to the correspondents invited and we can expect that one way or
                            another some will try to take advantage of it. I think that immediate
                            study should be given to this question so that there will be no doubt
                            about the Department’s attitude when questions are raised.<note n="5"

                        <p>The Pres. returned the call, and the Sec referred to the problem re the
                            invitation for correspondents to go to Red China. The Sec said he feels
                            we should oppose it and read the statement.<note n="2" xml:id="d200fn2"
                                    ><p>On August 7, the Department released a statement relating to
                                    the Chinese invitation which reads as follows:</p>
                                <p>“The Department of State has taken note of the fact that the
                                    Chinese Communist regime has announced that it has invited
                                    certain United States newspaper correspondents and commentators
                                    to visit Communist China.</p>
                                <p>“The State Department has taken this occasion to review carefully
                                    its policy with respect to the non-issuance of passports
                                    validated for travel to Communist China. After such review, it
                                    continues to be the policy of the State Department not to issue
                                    such passports.</p>
                                <p>“The United States welcomes the free exchange of information as
                                    between different countries irrespective of political and social
                                    differences. But the Chinese Communist regime has created a
                                    special impediment. It adopted the practice of taking American
                                    citizens into captivity and holding them in effect as political
                                    hostages. It continues to do so despite the fact that on
                                    September 10, 1955, at Geneva, it promised that all Americans in
                                    Communist China would be allowed expeditiously to exercise their
                                    right to return to the United States.</p>
                                <p>“So long as these conditions continue it is not considered to be
                                    in the best interests of the United States that Americans should
                                    accept the Chinese Communist invitation to travel in Communist
                                    China.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                                    August 20, 1956 pp. 313–314)</p></note> The Pres. said <pb
                                n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0446"/>it is one of those things where

                            about it yesterday from <persName>Cy Sulzberger</persName>. The Sec.
                            referred to the Geneva talks. The Pres. said to get in the thought that
                            it is our policy to open up exchanges etc. but Red China has not made it
                            possible for self-respecting countries to do it, etc.</p>

                        <p>129. 1. Two hour twenty minute meeting today. <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName> opened with statement that ten months have been
                            spent on discussion renunciation of force suggested by US and in spite
                            three <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> drafts submitted US still
                            “stubbornly clinging unacceptable demands.” While I had indicated
                            willingness hear <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> views on trade, my
                            statements had indicated I did not intend to carry on businesslike
                            discussion and settle this matter. This was “unfair and unequal” and
                            hoped this was not my intent. Therefore formally proposed we agree
                            discuss question embargo seek practical settlement.</p>
                        <p>2. In reply I made long statement reiterating renunciation as first
                            essential step in seeking peaceful settlement disputes, therefore could
                            not agree we abandon efforts reach agreement on this subject. Reviewed
                            history negotiations on this stressing retrogression May 11 draft,
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> attempt confuse with other
                            issues and establish preconditions for renunciation. Also reasserted
                            inseparable relationship between renunciation and trade but reminded him
                            I had previously agreed inclusion subject trade our discussions
                            therefore willing to hear his views. Also reiterated invitation amplify
                            aspects they had in mind in accordance questions asked my Nov 3
                            statement as well as <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0447"/>reiterated
                            statement made last meeting that no advantage to US in trade where goods
                            received can be used support use of force.</p>
                        <p>3. In reply he agreed renunciation force declaration “is at the heart of
                            the disputes between us” as attested by their patience ten months
                            negotiations on this and three successive drafts. I still failed put
                            forward any views which eliminate obstacles to agreement and no progress
                            could be made by repeating old arguments. He then made statement we
                            should strive step by step to resolve disputes, embargo was against
                            interest both countries, violated accepted international principles
                            trade, prejudiced interests other countries and provoked extreme
                            dissatisfaction people other countries, lifting would be first step in
                            improvement of relations as well as in interest American people, etc,
                            etc. Wanted to hear my views with regard to first steps for lifting
                            embargo. Should not entangle with other subjects or establish
                            preconditions.</p>
                        <p>4. I replied with statement charging they seeking unilateral advantage
                            from talks as demonstrated by their position with respect renunciation
                            and trade and then led directly into implementation pointing out
                            contrast between advantages resulting agreed announcement to <gloss

                        <p>5. He replied rejecting argument abolishment trade embargo solely in
                            interest <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> stating even among US
                            authorities “some people recognize necessity abolishing.” They were
                            continually receiving applications from American journalists for
                            permission visit China and they had now agreed in order correct false
                            stories and let them see construction of new and industrialized China.
                            Also to refute slanders about iron curtain or bamboo curtain. Pointing
                            out <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> had approved <pb n="420"

                            reciprocity, he wondered if US would have been able give reciprocity.
                            Charged US was actually iron curtain country and was absurd for US to
                            attempt exploit their approval these applications for “blackmail” and
                            demands extraneous preconditions. World and even American press would
                            blame US. As far as Chinese in US concerned many who had returned told
                            of efforts by <gloss target="#t_INS1">INS</gloss> persuade them go to
                            Taiwan or not return and when insisted on returning such unreasonable
                            time limits imposed as prevent them bringing personal belongings. This
                            violates spirit agreed announcement and at variance my statements
                            freedom Chinese to depart.</p>
                        <p>6. I refuted his charges with usual arguments not single case obstruction
                            brought attention Indian Embassy, etc., and pointed out only action by
                            his government could remove impediments if they desired Americans visit

                                attitude.<note n="4" xml:id="d201fn4">The Department’s attitude, as
                                outlined in guidance telegram 124 to Geneva, August 6, was that, in

                                journalists to visit China, “we consider it timely to remind

                                the invitation to visit China. He had in mind the legal questions
                                involved in the situation, and anticipated that the problem might

                            From amount conferring his assistants over my replies and other signs,
                            gained definite impression his intent was to set stage for at least
                            public statement if I flatly refused, or in even count obtain commitment
                            discuss to propose so informing press [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].</p>

                            other disputes” as occasion for reviewing questions US had thus far
                            presented here, that is, detained Americans, renunciation force, and
                            missing <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> personnel, asking him
                            whether implication his statement these problems would be resolved if US
                            agreed with them on trade matters. He avoided trap. In reply my review
                            concessions we had made in agreed announcement to obtain resolution
                            problem detained Americans and our disappointment at results he replied
                            that if US had “faithfully abided by announcement situation would be
                            much more satisfactory.” I of course rejected this. In reply my review
                            concessions we had made on renunciation force he said if US had accepted
                            principle of mutual respect in May 11 draft agreement could have been
                            reached. He rejected missing personnel as not in terms of <pb n="424"

                        <p>At 12:30 a.m. on August 23, a United States Navy patrol plane was shot
                            down off the Chushan islands in the East China Sea. Based on its final
                            reports the plane was approximately 180 miles north of Taiwan and 32
                            miles east of the Chinese mainland when it was shot down. A broadcast
                            from Peking on August 23 indicated that Chinese aircraft had damaged a
                                “<persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>” aircraft
                            near the Chushan islands. Some of the aircraft’s wreckage and two bodies
                            of crew members were recovered after an extensive search of the area by
                            United States naval aircraft. Two more bodies were later recovered on
                            the Chinese mainland and returned by Chinese authorities to American
                            officials in Japan. On August 25 the United States inquired, through the
                            British Chargé in Peking, about the missing plane and any survivors. The
                            Chinese Foreign Office replied on August 27, denying knowledge of an
                            American plane or crew, but referring to an attack by Chinese aircraft
                            on a “<persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> military plane” which
                            had intruded into Chinese air space. The note stated that if the plane
                            was a United States naval aircraft, China “could not but express great
                            regret”, but must also register a serious protest with the United States
                            Government over the intrusion into China’s territorial air space. The
                            United States responded on August 31 with a lengthy press release issued
                            jointly by the Departments of State and Defense which reviewed the
                            history of the incident, concluded that responsibility lay with the
                            People’s Republic of China, and demanded compensation for the loss of
                            American lives and property. In a press release issued in Peking on
                            September 3 the Chinese Government rejected United States demands for
                            compensation as “unjustified”, but the United States submitted a formal
                            demand for compensation through the British Chargé in Peking on
                            September 10. The Navy discontinued the search for survivors on
                            September 13. The Chinese press release of September 3 is summarized in

                            Government leaders have been greatly perturbed over reports that the
                            United States may be planning to withdraw its <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> advisers from the off-shore islands. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> explained that the
                            Chinese troops on the islands are now fully trained and no longer need
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisers for instruction
                            purposes. The Pentagon is anxious <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426"
                                facs="0454"/>to cut <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> expenses,
                            and the idea had been to have a gradual attrition of the advisers
                            stationed on the off-shore islands. The main problem from the U.S. point
                            of view is that we would lose our independent communications facilities.
                            He agreed that it would perhaps be best to plan for a reduced number of
                            advisers rather than to withdraw the entire group. A small group could
                            be left on the islands, possibly for communications purposes entirely.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> suggested that
                            consideration be given to the issuance of a press release which would
                            make it clear that the United States is not withdrawing its forces from
                            the islands.</p>

                                Coast</hi></p>
                        <p>There was discussion regarding salvage operations with respect to the
                            Navy plane shot down last week by the Chinese Communists. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> mentioned that he had
                            discussed the situation with the Secretary and that the Secretary was
                            not clear in his own mind regarding our legal position with respect to
                            salvage operations on the floor of the sea, as distinct from surface
                            operations to which the traditional three mile limit would apply. The
                            Secretary thought the President should know of the problem and that his
                            views should be ascertained. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> pointed out that underwater devices to locate the
                            plane wreckage were on the way to the scene in international waters but
                            that the wreckage itself has not yet been located. Therefore, the
                            question of salvage has not yet arisen. The Navy has the problem of
                            protecting the security of certain equipment which was on board the
                            plane and a major reason for our forces remaining in the area is for the
                            purpose of preventing the Chinese Communists from finding the wreckage
                            and removing it. He stressed that all that was needed now was State
                            Department clearance for the surface search. Once the wreckage was
                            located the problem of salvage operations could be faced.</p>
                        <p>There was some further discussion regarding a press release to be issued
                            the afternoon of August 31 regarding the plane incident.<note n="2"

                        <p>230. One hour fifty minute meeting this morning. I opened with statement

                                248 to Geneva, September 5, dealt with trade controls. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> was instructed to decline
                                to discuss the Chinese draft agreed announcement on trade, or to
                                discuss either the Chinese multilateral trade control system or the
                                U.S. embargo on trade with China. The U.S. refusal to discuss trade
                                controls was based upon: “(a) persistent Chinese Communist refusal
                                to renounce force which makes it unthinkable on national security
                                basis for U.S. to contribute through trade to Communist China
                                industrial and economic build up; and (b) Chinese Communist breach
                                of Agreed Announcement of September 10 which casts serious doubt on
                                Chinese Communist good faith in implementation of any commitment
                                Chinese Communist representatives may enter into”. The Department
                                took the position that “even if Chinese Communists have made firm
                                decision suspend talks unless we make concessions on trade, we do
                                not intend to yield to pressure on trade issue”. In paragraph 4 of

                                    >Johnson</persName> was instructed to give <persName

                            renunciation force and trade reiterating old points and then made fairly
                            extensive prepared statement on plane incident during which he refused
                            pickup Aug 31 press release, as “only <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> has right make protest this incident” and handed me
                            copy Sept 2 <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> press release. In reply
                            I pointed out that in my original statement I said I did not intend
                            enter into discussion plane incident here and was giving him copy press
                            release as matter of courtesy in order that his authorities would have
                            full and accurate text. Noted we had already received through <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> copy Sept 2 <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> release but glad take copy he had handed me. Then made
                            fairly extensive statement on trade and renunciation force making it
                            more explicitly clear than in opening statement that I was not willing
                            discuss trade until they had accepted principle of renunciation force
                            and agreement reached on text declaration. In course this statement
                            emphasized our record flexibility on language renunciation force
                            statement and willingness to consider and reconsider any language that
                            preserved essential principles. Hoped he would be in position next
                            meeting abandon May 11 draft and seriously negotiate with me on text
                            which would preserve area of agreement shown our April 19 draft. Avoided
                            any expressed or implied commitment we would present new draft.<note

                            publicity and propaganda and said that if they made statement US would,
                            of course, have to consider making reply.</p>
                        <p>I then made strong and extensive statement on implemention in reply to

                            They did a very thorough job. They carried out their instructions
                            precisely, presenting the three choices very fairly and explaining the
                            matter fully and impartially. We can say with confidence that no
                            pressure of any sort was exerted on the prisoners, and that they were
                            afforded an opportunity to make up their own minds on the basis of full
                            and exact information, without any interference. Three prisoners elected
                            to go to Mainland China, two to Taiwan, and nineteen preferred to remain
                            in prison to serve out their sentences. The remainder had already been
                            released under normal prison regulations. We are having <pb n="429"
                                xml:id="pg_429" facs="0457"/>the reports on each of the 24 cases
                            reproduced for transmittal by pouch to you either today or Monday.</p>
                        <p>We have not yet decided whether we will bring the Indian Embassy into the
                            picture as to the three who wish to go to Mainland China. We are leaning
                            in that direction mainly because we want to do everything possible to
                            influence Peiping to give <persName corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName>
                            more scope in his efforts to help our imprisoned nationals. At least we
                            want to put them as much on the defensive as possible if they refuse to
                            give <persName corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName> any better access.
                            We also would like to present the Communists with the bill for the
                            transportation of these people. Indian participation would make that
                            possible. On the other hand Indian participation might slow up the
                            procedure, when we are impatient to move the three out of here as fast
                            as possible. No final decision has been made yet. But we already are
                            working with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Bureau
                            of Prisons on the preliminary steps looking in the parole of the three
                            individuals for shipment out of the country. Immigration and
                            Naturalization Service does not care whether they are deported or leave
                            voluntarily with Indian assistance.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is committed in writing to take
                            any prisoners who choose Taiwan so long as the Indians are not allowed

                            list, we have brought the Japanese more or less into line. We have had
                            high level meetings with the British, French, Germans and Italians at
                            which we have presented quite strongly our case for preserving a
                            substantial China differential, with some concessions on our part. We
                            are hoping that with Japanese support, combined with the pressures we
                            are putting on these countries, we can hold the line at least for the
                            near future. A CG meeting is contemplated for December.</p>
                        <p>Everybody here likes the way you handled the last meeting. While we
                            naturally do not invite any resort to publicity by the Chinese
                            Communists, we are prepared to meet it and do not fear it.</p>

                        <p>On September 21 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Peking issued a

                            forward in the Geneva talks on August 21. Text of the Chinese statement
                            was transmitted to the Department in telegram 293 from Geneva, September
                            22; Department of State, Central Files, 611.93/9–2156. For text of the

                        <p>The United States responded with a press release issued by the Department
                            of State on September 24: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“For more than thirteen months the United States has been

                                    objectives has yet been achieved. On September 21 the Chinese
                                    Communists issued a statement announcing that they had proposed
                                    in the Geneva meetings that discussions be shifted to the
                                    question of relaxation of trade restrictions, but that the
                                    United States had ‘in effect refused.’</p>
                                <p>“The United States is not prepared to enter into a discussion of
                                    trade restrictions with the Chinese Communists at a time when
                                    they continue to refuse to renounce the use of force in the
                                    Taiwan area and continue to hold imprisoned American citizens as
                                    political hostages, despite their pledge in the Agreed
                                    Announcement of September 10, 1955, to permit them expeditiously
                                    to exercise their right to return. We have so informed the
                                    Chinese Communists at Geneva.</p>
                                <p>“It is hardly reasonable to expect the United States to discuss a
                                    relaxation of its trade restrictions when the trade that would
                                    result from such a relaxation would strengthen a regime which
                                    refuses to renounce the use of force against us.” (Department of

                                long duration of the talks lend color to this suspicion. This plays
                                into the hands of all of those throughout Asia who advocate policies
                                of closer relationships for their countries with Communist China.

                                them (which they evidently do) they may continue to hold some
                                Americans hostage to ensure that the talks continue. They may
                                estimate that if all Americans were freed we would have attained our

                                only commitment they have made to us in the course of the talks. It
                                would be more in keeping with our national dignity and would be
                                readily understood throughout the world if we were to refuse to talk
                                any longer with a regime which has shown its contempt for us by
                                flouting its word. The tactical advantages we have obtained at
                                Geneva could be preserved by the right type of break-off statement,
                                which would emphasize that we would welcome at any time a bona fide

                                is the presence of powerful American armed forces. The second
                                important deterrent is the Chinese Communist desire to maintain a
                                peaceful posture before the world. These two factors would continue

                                <p>“I may well be wrong and you all may well be right, but I do not
                                    think it can be assumed because they have continued talking up
                                    to now they will continue to do so indefinitely. During past
                                    months I have been able to do a certain amount of stringing them
                                    along and dangling a certain amount of ‘pie in the sky’, but I
                                    have now largely run out of that as I have never been in a
                                    position where I could say if you do so and so we will do so and
                                    so. I full well realize the reasons it has never been possible
                                    to enable me to take any such positions, but I know also that
                                    you realize the extremely narrow limits in which this has
                                    required I operate. As I did full well realize this at my last
                                    meeting I threw renunciation in the cultural exchange package
                                    and strengthened it today. My only point is that with the
                                    material now at hand, I do not feel confident that I will be
                                    able to keep things going much longer. Perhaps I feel low this
                                    afternoon after the verbal exercise of this morning and perhaps

                                been increased. At the same time, however, the international
                                position of the National Government has declined, causing an
                                increased feeling of insecurity and concern for the future.</item>

                                remains in power no substantial change in Nationalist policy is
                                likely to occur. Should he die prior to the expiration of his

                                will almost certainly continue to decline. Although the Chinese

                                Taiwan probably will not weaken critically so long as the people

                            <item>In the longer run, it is likely that evidence of growing prestige
                                and material progress on the part of the Chinese Communists will
                                have a serious impact upon the attitude of the people on Taiwan.

                                    Communist failure carry out pledge made in Agreed Announcement.
                                    Lead off with <persName>McCarthy</persName> case as typical
                                    example of Communist disregard of pledged word. First point out

                                    should have been released long ago if clear language of Agreed
                                    Announcement had any meaning. Now one of nine belatedly

                                    from leaving and requesting representations his behalf. When

                                <p>“The principal event since your last meeting has been the Chinese
                                    Communist last-moment refusal to allow Addis, the British
                                    Counselor from Peiping, to see Father
                                        <persName>McCarthy</persName> in Ward Road Jail in Shanghai
                                    on October 5, after all arrangements had been made and after
                                    Addis arrived at the prison. Addis was met with the bland
                                    statement from the officials that <persName>McCarthy</persName>
                                    had changed his mind and did not want to see Addis. The
                                    officials added that they could not force
                                        <persName>McCarthy</persName> to have the interview. Addis
                                    was naturally taken aback, but did what he could by way of
                                    remonstrance. The British are of course as aware as we are that
                                        <persName>McCarthy</persName> did not voluntarily change his
                                    mind. The Communist claim was either an outright lie, or else
                                    they had broken <persName>McCarthy</persName>. We suspect that
                                    they want to demonstrate to the British that they are wasting
                                    their time in trying to see the prisoners. The Communist
                                    decision may have been made after they allowed Father
                                        <persName>McCarthy</persName> ’s letter to <persName
                                        corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName> to be delivered. We are
                                    enclosing a copy of the full text of this letter, which shows
                                    that Father <persName>McCarthy</persName> was alert and resolute
                                    when he wrote the letter. We have it from other sources that he
                                    probably is the most resourceful and durable of the remaining
                                    Shanghai prisoners, which makes it all the more unlikely that he
                                    would have voluntarily given up the fight. Since this represents
                                    a callous and completely indefensible hardening of the Chinese
                                    Communist position, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"

                                must continue to have first priority in the development of the

                                bilateral aid agreements, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that
                                U.S. programs for development and support of these forces must be
                                oriented toward the military situation most likely to be faced in
                                event of external aggression and toward the mission which they can

                            <item>A realistic appraisal must recognize that direct U.S. military
                                intervention will probably be necessary in the event of external
                                attack, particularly by the Chinese Communists or the <gloss

                                necessary, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that a concept based
                                on cooperative effort involving the pre-planning for the use of
                                combined forces (U.S. and indigenous) in which each member
                                contributes that which it can do most effectively, must be adhered
                                to. While we should not specify in detail the forces which we would
                                make available in the event of war, we should conduct joint planning
                                with each of the nations involved and give a broad indication of a
                                strategic plan whereby the United States would come to their

                            <item>A major objective of the United States with respect to Taiwan is
                                the development of the military potential of the <gloss

                                collective non-Communist strength in the Far East. The Chinese
                                Nationalists currently have in being an army of 21 active divisions.
                                This force poses a constant and substantial threat to the Chinese
                                Communists. So long as this threat remains, it will require that
                                large numbers of Communist troops be committed to the defense of the
                                Chinese mainland against possible attack. Therefore, the Joint
                                Chiefs of Staff consider that, from a military point of view, any
                                reduction of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces would reduce
                                the over-all capability of the United States to counter Communist

                            <item>It is considered that the Chinese Communists have the capability
                                to seize the Quemoy and Matsu groups, assuming that these islands
                                were defended by Nationalist forces alone. Conversely, with U.S.
                                assistance these islands could be held.</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>The Chinese Communists have the capability to launch and support
                                an initial assault against Taiwan and/or Penghu utilizing a maximum
                                of 75–100,000 fully equipped troops. The assault could be supported
                                by Fresco and Beagle aircraft using newly constructed fields in East
                                China. Such an assault would probably succeed in reaching Taiwan if
                                it were attempted against Nationalist naval and air forces only.
                                However, it is considered that the United States, utilizing U.S.
                                forces presently deployed to the Western Pacific, would prevent a
                                successful Communist assault against Taiwan and Penghu.</item>

                                would require tremendous increases in naval and air units to build

                            contains some of my thoughts on the current world situation for your
                            consideration. Your re-election is a blessing not only to the American
                            people and the cause of Sino-American friendship, but also to the future
                            of mankind.</p>
                        <p>The world situation today is, in my opinion, even more serious than what
                            it was four years ago when you first assumed office. For this reason, it
                            presents a greater challenge and a historic opportunity to the free
                            world. The recent revolts in the satellite countries in East Europe
                            foretell the eventual downfall of Soviet imperialism. It is for us now
                            to give every encouragement and support to these forces of freedom so
                            that they may grow in strength and effectiveness. We must never allow
                            them to be ruthlessly suppressed and exterminated by their despotic
                            rulers. For this would bring despair to the peoples behind the Iron
                            Curtain and condemn them to perpetual enslavement.</p>
                        <p>In recent months, I am much disturbed by the mounting influence of
                            neutralism, particularly in Asia. Disguised as a movement for peace, its
                            evil influence does not seem to have been fully realized by the world at
                            large. In order to combat Communism effectively, I feel <pb n="447"
                                xml:id="pg_447" facs="0475"/>that we must at the same time direct
                            our attention to holding neutralism firmly in check, so that the
                            solidarity of the free world may not be impaired and the hopes of the
                            enslaved peoples doomed. I am sure that in your position, you must be
                            keenly aware of the dangerous ramifications of neutralism.</p>
                        <p>It is gratifying to note that the United States has taken strides in
                            strengthening its own defense and in reinforcing that of the free
                            nations through its military and economic aid programs abroad. This has
                            indeed done much to deter Communist aggression. But Soviet Russia, apart
                            from continuing with its active military preparations, is vigorously
                            pursuing its well-known “protracted warfare” by resorting to all kinds
                            of cold war tactics. As a result, the free world has been outmaneuvered
                            into a passive position and Soviet Russia seems to be able to create
                            situations in times and places of its own choice and to its own
                            advantage.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, it seems to me that while avoiding a direct
                            conflict with Soviet Russia and military involvement abroad, the United
                            States, as the leader of the free nations, should assume the role of a
                            world arsenal for the democracies in combatting Communism. Only thus can
                            the United States make the fullest use of the available manpower and
                            resources of its allies and wrest the initiative from the Communists.
                            This is the only way to prevent the consolidation of the Communist
                            forces and counter their further aggression.</p>
                        <p>Today, the inherent weaknesses of Communism are already beginning to
                            manifest themselves as serious upheaval and unrest becomes widespread in
                            all areas under Communist control. This might well be a turning point if
                            the free world could take advantage of this favorable development by
                            puncturing the Iron Curtain at its most vulnerable spots in Europe and
                            in Asia. Once the Iron Curtain is punctured, the ensalved peoples behind
                            it will rise in revolt against the Communist tyranny. Confronted with
                            pressure both from within and without, Soviet Russia and its puppet
                            regime in Peiping will be denied the advantage of massing their total
                            strength for repression at home or aggression abroad. I feel that
                            effective measures should be taken to carry out this positive strategy.
                            If, on the contrary, we fail to heed the anguished appeals of the
                            enslaved peoples, we would only prolong and intensify their sufferings
                            while causing them to lose faith in the eventual triumph of freedom over
                            slavery. The tragedy of the recent abortive anti-Communist uprisings in
                            Poland, Hungary, and in Tibet and Sinkiang should be taken as a bitter
                            lesson for the democracies.</p>
                        <p>I recall how, four years ago at the time of your election, the hopes of
                            the free world were lifted by your farsighted statesmanlike references
                            to the liberation of the captive peoples. Under your able leadership,
                            the free world has made decided progress in its capacity <pb n="448"
                                xml:id="pg_448" facs="0476"/>to deter aggression. This has given
                            rise to greater hopes and expectancy on the part of the free world for
                            the eventual deliverance of the enslaved peoples. Your re-election and
                            the greater prestige which you now justly enjoy will make it possible
                            for you to lead the free world to undertake this historic task, upon the
                            outcome of which hinges the fate of mankind and human civilization.</p>
                        <p>I feel that you have now before you a task far greater in consequence and
                            in the number of lives involved than that which was accomplished by
                            President <persName>Lincoln</persName> in the emancipation of slaves in
                            the United States. In this, I pledge to you my whole-hearted support and
                            cooperation. As millions of people of the world are looking to you in
                            their continuing struggle for freedom, it is my fervent hope and prayer
                            that, under your leadership in the next four years of office, the world
                            will see not only the emancipation of the captive peoples in Europe as
                            well as in Asia, but also the fulfillment of our long-cherished
                            aspirations for freedom, peace and justice.</p>
                        <p>My wife and I take this opportunity to send you and Mrs. <persName

                                    United States has been continually haggling over implementation
                                    of Geneva agreement and of violating it by failing furnish China
                                    with complete list of names Chinese nationals under detention
                                    and those who are being prevented from returning China. So far
                                    as I understand position it is that Geneva agreement
                                    contemplated release those prisoners who were under detention
                                    and had not been convicted in accordance with legal process and
                                    that to circumvent agreement Chinese rapidly secured conviction
                                    eight Americans under detention. Hence your government regard
                                    Chinese as guilty of breach faith. In regard to Chinese on list,
                                    I understand there are no Chinese nationals under detention who
                                    are eligible for release and no Chinese nationals who have been
                                    prevented from returning to China. I should be grateful if you

                                    territories as Formosa, Quemoy and Matsu. He alleged Hong Kong,

                                    activities against Chinese mainland. He referred to 800 American
                                    “bases” Japan, Philippines and Siam. He said tension this area

                                    impression is that Peking would be prepared release remaining

                                    said yes and at considerable detail. The Pres. said we don’t use
                                    the word never but until these things that are going on have
                                    been relieved there is no sense talking about it. He said

                                    Pres. said the hell it hasn’t and explained what had been done.
                                    The Sec said he talked to him Sunday and said if they let the 10
                                    go we would take a different position on passports and that
                                    might break the logjam. The Pres. also spoke re breaking the

                        <p>A memorandum of <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> on
                            December 19 was prepared in the White House, but a note on the source
                            text reads: “Practically impossible to hear the Prime Minister”. The
                            identity of the person who prepared the memorandum is not indicated on
                            the source text. The section of the memorandum dealing with China reads
                            as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Prime Minister talked at length, mentioning the name of
                                        <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>. The
                                    President said that is number one priority. He spoke of the
                                    incident of the invitation for newspapermen to go over there,
                                    and our thought that, step by step, we might have been able to
                                    reach some kind of modus vivendi.</p>
                                <p>“The President spoke of his conversations with <persName
                                        corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>. When he visited
                                    there right after the War, he was impressed to hear everybody
                                    talking perfectly freely, and that they seemed to like ‘having
                                    us around.’ They put the President in the most beautiful
                                    quarters he has ever been in. There seemed no danger, or no
                                    thought of any molestation or interference. The President said
                                    that he, for one, was particularly shocked when we saw
                                    developing in the country those terrible pictures of United
                                    States victims.</p>
                                <p>“The President said he would like to get our people over their
                                    currently very adverse attitude toward Red China. They put Red
                                    China at the bottom of the list, even below Russia, which he
                                    does not understand—but that it is true. He thinks most of it is
                                    about the ten prisoners and the fact, as he had told <persName
                                        corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> the other day, of the
                                    casualties suffered in Korea. Our people are sensitive—in World
                                    War II, they thought that it was something that had to be
                                    fought. He said he never heard discussed so much the theories of
                                    World War II as of the casualties of Korea. So the President
                                    thinks the main thing from our side is (a) the ten prisoners,
                                    and (b) Korea.</p>
                                <p>“With those things straightened out, we would of course naturally
                                    do something with our public opinion here; secondly, we could do
                                    something, as the President had said before, about sending
                                    newspapermen over there who would begin to find out what they
                                    are thinking. There would then be a flow of news coming back
                                    that would tend to ameliorate this uneasy state of pandimonium.
                                    And <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0482"/>there could, out of
                                    such a small achievement as this, spring something very
                                    fine.</p>
                                <p>“But the President’s feeling, as of this moment, is that it is
                                    impossible for us to take the first step. He said <persName

                            that the only thing he knows and understands well is strength. The
                            President <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0483"/>said that the United
                            States should never fear that India would go Communist. He deplored the
                            way in which the United States placated and coddled <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>. He stated that that is the very
                            way which would make him lean toward the Communists and that the United
                            States should take a firmer and stronger hand in dealing with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> was an individual who
                            might lose power tonight and that the Indian people would remain and
                            that the United States must exert every peaceful effort to prevent a
                            large group of people from orienting themselves to Communism or becoming
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> cited another
                            country—Burma—which had previously chosen to align itself with the
                            neutralist bloc, but that now, in the face of recent events, Burma was
                            beginning to orient itself toward the free world and that there was hope
                            that India would, in due and good time, shift its position from one of
                            neutralism to one of stronger ties with the free world.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the Chinese Communists should be dealt with in a
                            firm manner, that the only thing the Communists know and understand is
                            strength and that the United States Government is in a position to
                            assume real and effective leadership from strength. He stated that the
                            Geneva talks should be terminated forthwith. It was his opinion that,
                            had a firm stand been taken in the beginning, the American prisoners
                            would have been released, and, as it is, the talks have been dragging on
                            for over a year and the release of the prisoners is still not in
                            sight.</p>
                        <p>The President kept pointing up the leadership of the United States and
                            stated that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            is, since his re-election, at the peak of his prestige and power as a
                            world leader, and that he has the highest regard for him and his
                            leadership.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> stated that he
                            heartily approved of the stand which President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> took in the recent Suez
                            crisis. As regards Hungary President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName> stated that the free world must not and cannot
                            let the liberation movement in Hungary die. He stated that if this
                            movement or effort to become free is crushed, it would be a terrific
                            blow to the free world and to people under Communist domination who
                            sought freedom and who are willing to fight and die for it.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that the United States must assume the leadership in
                            some way to help the people of Hungary who are still fighting and dying
                            for a cause of which the free world is proud but which the free world
                            has not seen fit to give sufficient help.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> inquired just what
                            did President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> have in mind
                            that the United States could do.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> smiled and stated
                            that he had very definite and concrete ideas of what could and might be
                            done but that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> has not appointed him as his Chief of
                            Staff.</p>
                        <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0484"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stated that the
                            United States was leaving no stone unturned in its endeavor to have all
                            differences between nations settled by peaceful means through the United
                            Nations and that the President wished to continue to use the United
                            Nations in our efforts to settle disputes wherever they might arise.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> remarked that it
                            was the United States prestige and leadership which made the United
                            Nations, and that without the United States the United Nations would be
                            an empty shell incapable of accomplishing anything.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> remarked that the
                            United Nations passes endless resolutions and there is considerable
                            exchange of views within the United Nations regarding the plight of
                            oppressed people like the Hungarians, but that the United Nations had
                            never taken the firm and positive stand and approach necessary to give
                            effective assistance to Hungary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that we had the
                            United Nations with us and that as long as it existed, which he hoped
                            would be forever, we must use the United Nations to the fullest.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> interspersed his
                            remarks from time to time with the comment that he was only talking as
                            one friend to another friend and that the United States should assume a
                            stronger role in world leadership which has become our
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>At this point Madame <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> came
                            into the room and spoke to her husband which was a signal for the
                            conversation to terminate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stated that he
                            wished to say just one more thing, and that was that we welcome
                            constructive advice from our friends and that without their friendship
                            and help and advice our task would be much harder, and that we looked
                            forward to closer and stronger ties with our Chinese friends.</p>

                        <p>After normal amenities, Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu
                                Ta-Wei</persName> stated that he had seen <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGNF1">General Twining</persName> and Secretary
                                <persName>Quarles</persName>. He had hoped also to see <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> but had been unable to
                            because <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> had been
                            ill. The Minister said that he would like to give the Admiral a round-up
                            of the Nationalist China military situation, that he hoped to see
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName>, and would
                            report further to <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> after this meeting.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> gave the following
                            summary report of the readiness of the Chinese Nationalist forces:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Army</hi>. 21 divisions are in an advanced state of
                            training and have been combat-ready since 31 October 1956. From the
                            logistical viewpoint there are some deficiencies. However, they will be
                            corrected by May of next year at which time all troops, including
                            logistic elements, will be fully combat ready.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Navy</hi>. The Navy has continued training and is
                            considered to be in a good state of readiness. The basic deficiencies
                            here are associated with the problem of maintenance, largely incident to
                            the many types of ships which they have. (This is directed primarily to
                            the Japanese type ships which are part of the Nationalist Navy.)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Air Force</hi>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YT1"
                                >Yu</persName> considers that the Air Force is in a high condition
                            of readiness. The F–84 groups are combat ready and the F–86 groups are
                            combat ready except for one which will be ready in March. At that time
                            they will have five combat ready groups, in addition to the
                            reconnaissance, patrol, and transport aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> then stated that the
                            Chinese Nationalists had gone through several phases in their
                            development. The first phase was at the time of the Truman announcement
                            regarding protection of Taiwan.<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2">Apparent
                                reference to the announcement by President
                                    <persName>Truman</persName> on June 27, 1950, in the wake of the
                                outbreak of fighting in Korea, in which he instructed the Seventh
                                Fleet to prevent an attack on Taiwan and to see that all sea and air
                                operations by the Republic of China against the Chinese mainland
                                were stopped. (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                                July 3, 1950, p. 5)</note> The second phase was what the Minister
                            called the hardware movement phase. This has largely been completed. The
                            third phase, and the Minister considers that they are in that now, is
                            the phase of bringing about a combined defense and joint effort with the
                            United States. He pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >Chinat</gloss>s do not want more hardware at this time because they
                            would be unable to utilize it efficiently. (New equipment would be
                            required only for replacement purposes.) In this connection the basic
                            problem is one of maintenance. The <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >Chinat</gloss>s now have 5000 technicians in training and can’t
                            absorb any more.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> then indicated that he
                            was puzzled about what to do at this time. They have good forces that
                            are highly trained and he is casting about for ideas as to how to keep
                            them in this condition. <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0486"
                                /><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> pointed
                            out that the problem which the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                            >Chinat</gloss>s have is essentially the same as our own. Our personnel
                            change rather rapidly, so there is a continuing requirement for training
                            as new personnel are inducted.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then turned to a discussion of the new German draft law,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> suggested
                            that maybe something along this line might prove beneficial to the
                            Chinese. He asked Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> of
                            the status of the manpower pool on Taiwan. Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> indicated that he had no problem at
                            this time and for the next few years, but that he anticipated the
                            situation would get bad in about three years. However, he came back to
                            the point that maintenance was the number one problem. Again <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> referred to the German
                            solution, in which personnel who want technical training would have to
                            agree to serve longer periods of time. He also referred to the fact that
                            volunteers of the German Armed Forces receive higher pay than do
                            draftees.</p>
                        <p>In extension of his thoughts about the phase three which they were now
                            in, Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> indicated that it
                            was his objective to have the Chinese Navy as an adjunct of the Seventh
                            Fleet; to be particularly available to perform jobs which the American
                            Naval forces are not authorized to perform. With respect to the Air
                            Force, he desired to have the combat units in such condition that they
                            might operate as an integral part of <gloss target="#t_FEAF1"
                                >FEAF</gloss>. In this connection he pointed out that it would be
                            necessary to tie in their radar network with ours and for this and other
                            reasons we must have much better communications between Taiwan and
                            Okinawa than we have at the present time. He also observed that there
                            are no better reconnaissance units in the world than the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s. However, he felt the U.S.
                            should provide its own all-weather fighter units. With regard to the
                            Army, he again emphasized the fact that the active divisions are combat
                            ready and that the reserve is almost ready. The training program turns
                            out nine companies of troops each week. He indicated with respect to all
                            forces that he would like very much to maintain a forward looking policy
                            and to keep their forces modern. In this regard he would welcome the
                            deployment of Matador units on Taiwan at the earliest possible date and
                            would also like to have advanced equipment such as Nike and Talos
                            deployed to Taiwan and the off-shore islands at an early date. With
                            regard to the Navy, the principal thing he wanted to do was to replace
                            the old Japanese type ships with American types. He indicated that he

                            considerable. He said they had recently found a new Jet field about 190
                            miles north of Canton. He indicated that the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >Chinat</gloss>s were tying down approximately 50% of the <gloss

                            the Chinese mainland opposite Taiwan. The railroad to Amoy is completed
                            but is not yet in use.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> inquired as to
                            the impact of the Hungarian situation in China. Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> said that this situation had made a
                            decided impact on the Chinese and that he felt that the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s were making significant progress
                            in regard to the people on the Chinese mainland. He pointed out that the
                            situation now as compared to 1949 is quite different, insofar as the
                            overseas Chinese are concerned. In 1949 about 20 overseas Chinese went
                            back to the China mainland as opposed to about one to Taiwan. Now the
                            situation is reversed. In this connection <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Admiral Radford</persName> suggested that the <gloss

                            possible to attract investments in Taiwan from wealthy overseas
                            Chinese.</p>
                        <p>The conversation ended with Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1"
                                >Yu</persName> again summarizing the condition of the <gloss

                            <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                            <p>Thank you for your message of December 11<note n="2" xml:id="d225fn2"
                                    >Transmitted in <ref target="#d220">Document 220</ref>.</note>
                                transmitted to me by Ambassador <persName>Hildreth</persName>.</p>
                            <p>I share your strong desire to bring about harmony among nations and
                                contribute to a lasting peace. It was in this spirit that in
                                mid-1955 we undertook conversations with the Chinese Communists at
                                Geneva. Although those talks have not borne out our hopes, they are
                                continuing and we intend to persevere. Under present circumstances
                                we are convinced that the Ambassadorial level is more appropriate
                                than the Foreign Minister level for this limited negotiation with
                                the Chinese Communists. The matters under discussion can be dealt
                                with adequately by the fully empowered Ambassadors who are meeting
                                regularly at Geneva, if the Chinese Communists have any desire to
                                reach a reasonable agreement on these matters. Since they have so
                                far not demonstrated such a desire we do not consider that raising
                                the level of the talks would improve the prospects of agreement.</p>
                            <p>We cannot alter our opposition to Chinese Communist entry into the
                                United Nations simply on the basis of Chinese Communist pretenses of
                                good will and in the absence of concrete actions which would
                                demonstrate without question that their policies and practices have
                                changed since the United Nations declared them aggressors in Korea.
                                The seating of Communist China in the United Nations under present
                                circumstances, would, in my opinion, gravely imperil the progress
                                which has been made in strengthening the independence of the free
                                countries of Asia, violate the provisions of the Charter as to
                                membership, and strike a serious blow at the vital interests of our
                                ally, the Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the ten American civilians (all reputable persons held
                                on political charges) who are still wrongfully imprisoned in
                                Communist China, we consider that they should all have been released
                                long ago. The Chinese Communists declared in the Agreed Announcement
                                of September 10, 1955 that ‘Americans in the People’s Republic of
                                China who desire to return to the United States are entitled to do
                                so’ and further promised to ‘adopt appropriate measures so that they
                                can expeditiously exercise their right to return’. This pledge was
                                not qualified in any way and was clearly understood to apply to the
                                Americans in jail, for these were the very persons on whose behalf
                                we were negotiating. We have never been concerned in the Geneva
                                talks with Chinese Communist legal processes and the question of
                                whether or not some of the Americans had been ‘convicted’. Our
                                concern—referred to by <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                    En-lai</persName> as ‘haggling’ and ‘dragging out the talks’—was
                                and continues to be to bring the Chinese Communists to fulfill their
                                public commitment to free all of the imprisoned Americans.</p>
                            <p>With respect to Chinese in the United States, I can assure you that
                                no Chinese is prevented from leaving this country. We issued a
                                public appeal for anyone who knew of a Chinese being prevented from
                                leaving to bring it to the Government’s attention. No one has done
                                so. Moreover, we made arrangements for the American National Red
                                Cross to interview personally all Chinese aliens in Federal and <pb

                                country in order to ascertain which of them desired to go to
                                Communist China. There were some thirty such prisoners, all common
                                criminals serving terms for various crimes such as traffic in
                                narcotics or homicide. Only one chose to go to Communist China in
                                preference to completing his sentence. He was deported there through
                                Hong Kong on October 29.</p>
                            <p>Our experience with the Chinese Communist refusal to fulfill their
                                pledge to release American civilians does not encourage us to rely
                                on any other pledges they might give in the future. Nevertheless, we
                                are pressing them at Geneva to recognize that the serious issue with
                                us regarding the Taiwan area should not lead to armed conflict. We
                                seek an unqualified renunciation of the use of force, which they
                                adamantly refuse to give. The continued assertion by the Chinese
                                Communists that they are entitled to attack Taiwan if it is not
                                surrendered to them, coupled with the standing Chinese Communist
                                threat to the Republic of Korea and all Southeast Asia, is a
                                continuing source of instability in the area and a chronic threat to
                                the peace. The disturbing Chinese Communist buildup of its
                                aggressive capabilities in the South China area is a cause for grave
                                concern. Were the Chinese Communist threat of force demonstrably
                                removed, the conferees at Geneva could proceed to the discussion of
                                other practical matters at issue.</p>

                        <p>On December 24, <persName>William Worthy</persName>, correspondent for

                                    <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName>. It is gratifying
                                to know that in carrying out my responsibilities in the difficult
                                years ahead I can rely not only on support at home, but also on the
                                understanding cooperation of staunch allies abroad.</p>
                            <p>I believe we are in agreement that the world situation today, and for
                                the next few years, presents both serious dangers and challenging
                                opportunities. Recent developments in the European Soviet bloc
                                afford ample evidence that the oppressed peoples are beginning,
                                little by little, to shake loose the iron control of their Communist
                                rulers. Once started, such a popular movement is extremely difficult
                                to halt or reverse.</p>
                            <p>The present difficulties in the Communist world demonstrate the
                                weaknesses of the Communist system. In those weaknesses lies the
                                hope that the people now suffering under Communist dominion can
                                eventually gain their freedom without direct military action by the
                                free world. We must recognize, of course, that the portentous
                                changes taking place in the Soviet bloc, and indeed within the
                                Soviet Union itself, while giving cause for hope, do carry risks of
                                erratic Communist ventures. Therefore, during this critical period
                                it is necessary for the countries of the free world to remain calm
                                but steadfast <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0491"/>fast in their
                                dedication to the principles of the United Nations Charter, which we
                                all uphold.</p>
                            <p>The free countries must maintain their military strength, encourage
                                healthy economic development and fortify their will to remain
                                independent. It is important also to minimize differences between
                                them which frequently tend to serve Communist ends. With greater
                                progress toward these objectives, we can, I believe, face the future
                                with confidence.</p>
                            <p>We do not yet see within the Communist-dominated parts of Asia the
                                same degree of unrest apparent in Eastern Europe. Yet, I believe
                                that if we persevere in our present firm policy, particularly with
                                respect to the Chinese Communists, we can confidently expect to see
                                in the Far Eastern area also, a growing rebelliousness among the
                                captive peoples which their Communist rulers will, in the end, be
                                unable to contain. We must be prepared to take advantage of any such
                                developments in an appropriate manner when the time arrives. I am
                                confident that the continued close cooperation of our two countries
                                will contribute to this end.</p>
                            <p>In order to develop effective policies in the countries of the free
                                world, it is of the greatest importance that we understand fully
                                each other’s viewpoints. It is particularly helpful to know how
                                Asian leaders themselves view developments in that area of rapid
                                change. I appreciate, therefore, receiving your frank assessment of
                                the Far Eastern situation and I hope that we can continue, from time
                                to time, to exchange ideas on this subject.</p>

                                to you and Madame <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> our

                                <p>U.S. defense arrangements in the area and the military assistance
                                    program were continued along established lines and adequately
                                    ensured the security of Taiwan (Paras. 3a, c, d). Working
                                    relations with the Chinese were good.</p>
                                <p>The Chinese Communists continued to increase their military
                                    capability and to call for the take-over of Taiwan by military
                                    force if necessary (Paras. 4, 9). The Communist propaganda and
                                    diplomatic campaign against the Chinese Government on Taiwan was
                                    intensified and it was increasingly difficult to maintain the
                                    international position of that Government even though it took
                                    some effective steps in countering the Communist campaign
                                    (Paras. 7, 8).</p>
                                <p>With the cooperation of the Chinese Government progress was made
                                    in strengthening the economy of Taiwan (Para. 3e). More
                                    attention needs to be paid to the expansion of the island’s
                                    productive capacity if Taiwan is to achieve and maintain a
                                    satisfactory rate of economic progress (Paras. 3e, 12, 13).</p>
                                <p>Since the report was approved by the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"

                            considerable urgency in his mission, and apparently reflects the concern
                            with which Peiping views events in Eastern Europe. The Chinese Communist
                            premier abruptly cut short his stay in India and postponed his visit to
                            Nepal and Afghanistan in order to be able to stop over briefly in
                            Peiping en route to Moscow. Some light is shed on Chinese Communist
                            policies and possibly on <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s
                            trip by the release on December 28, less than a week before <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s return to Peiping, of the first
                            Chinese Communist commentary on Tito’s dispute with the Kremlin.</p>
                        <p>The December 28 commentary contained nothing designed to assuage Asian
                            concern at Soviet policies in Eastern Europe. On the contrary, it
                            elaborately rationalized Soviet actions against Hungary and the Soviet
                            position in the Tito dispute. Peiping stated that it sympathized with
                            parts of Tito’s argument, but that “comradely criticism” of Communist
                            leaders must be subordinated to the struggle of Communism against the
                            West. Peiping restated its criticism of “great national chauvinism” (for
                            the first time attributed specifically to Stalin) and its insistence
                            that Communist regimes should maintain their “independence.” However,
                            the Chinese Communists made it clear that bloc members should
                            subordinate themselves in the struggle against the West to Soviet
                            leadership and that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should
                            continue to constitute the prime model for revolutionary regimes.
                            Peiping reiterated its primary concern with the necessity of restoring
                            and maintaining bloc solidarity.</p>
                        <p>The reservations concerning Soviet policy suggest that on some points the
                            Chinese Communists may attempt tactfully to mediate between Moscow and
                            certain Eastern European leaders. However, the main impact of Peiping’s
                            policy and of <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s trip more
                            likely will be to support the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            to cut short Eastern European hopes that Peiping’s sympathy for more
                            flexible bloc relationships may extend to the point of supporting
                            “national Communism” against Moscow.</p>

                            and <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>. All of us sympathize
                            with you in the frustrating and exasperating position <pb n="467"
                                xml:id="pg_467" facs="0495"/>in which you find yourself; with the
                            talks apparently leading nowhere and dragging on indefinitely with the
                            same tired points being reworked ad infinitum and ad nauseam at every
                            meeting. Undoubtedly it is difficult for the man who is on the scene and
                            who is carrying the chief burden to see the further utility of the
                            exercise. However the talks are precisely fulfilling the primary purpose
                            envisaged by the Secretary in 1955. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> told him yesterday about your letter including
                            the question you had raised about the desirability of prolonging the
                            talks. The Secretary smilingly recalled that when he was giving you your
                            instructions he had mentioned to you that you should be prepared to
                            carry on the talks for two years. The Secretary said that you were
                            handling the talks exactly in accordance with his wishes, and that the
                            talks were serving the purpose he had in mind. He appreciated the
                            difficulties you confront but his views as to the importance of the
                            talks and the desirability of continuing them had not changed. He said
                            that when the Middle East pressures subsided somewhat, he would be glad
                            to review the matter and give careful attention to any arguments against
                            continuation of the talks which we might consider overriding. But as of
                            now he felt the talks should continue and that you should know that he
                            approves the way in which you have conducted the talks.</p>
                        <p>Undoubtedly the talks continue to cause us some embarrassment, and lead
                            to some misunderstanding of our posture vis-à-vis Communist China,
                            especially in the Far East. Also the continuance of the talks makes it
                            difficult for us to manifest the full extent of our dissatisfaction at
                            Chinese Communist violation of the Agreed Announcement. On the other
                            hand, we still have the Chinese Communists tied up in talks which may
                            make it more difficult for them to start any hostilities in the Taiwan
                            area. If they should initiate any such action while conversations are
                            going on, the risk they would run of general world condemnation and
                            possible multilateral sanctions against them would be appreciably
                            increased. While the Chinese Communists obviously estimate at this stage
                            that their interests are best served by continuing the talks, they are
                            probably not happy over the negotiating situation in which they find
                            themselves and would be delighted if we broke off the talks. An onus
                            would attach to the side which took the initiative to break off the
                            talks, and this the Chinese Communists want to avoid. We have them in a
                            situation where they are on the defensive on both of the principal
                            points at issue, and unable to improve their negotiating position. As
                            one officer put it, if we broke off the talks now we would in a sense be
                            letting the Chinese Communists off the hook and would be giving up just
                            at a time when we for once are beating them at their own game by
                            out-sitting and out-talking them. As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1"
                                >Phleger</persName> put it, “<persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Alex</persName> is doing fine, and should carry on along the lines
                            that he has already <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0496"/>developed
                            so well”. You don’t need to worry about repetition, or lack of new
                            topics. It may be a dreary, boring business but it is serving a purpose
                            which is more apparent here than it can be in the front line. The talks
                            undoubtedly are reducing the pressures from European quarters for other
                            U.S. contacts with the Chinese Communists and they make it much easier
                            to refute the arguments advanced for a Foreign Minister level
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>2. We were quite interested in the record of the last meeting. <persName

                                    Schuman</persName> were indicted by a federal grand jury in San

                                during the Korean war. The Powells and Schuman published <hi

                                1953 and were specifically charged with conspiring to hamper the
                                progress of U.S. armed forces in Korea by publishing articles
                                accusing the United States of germ warfare in the conflict. On
                                October 5, a federal court order was issued granting the defendants
                                the right to take depositions on their behalf at government expense
                                in the People’s Republic of China. On October 11, the Government of
                                the People’s Republic of China announced that it had found 50
                                persons willing to testify in support of the Powells and Schuman on
                                the question of the American use of germ warfare during the Korean
                                conflict. Abraham L. Wirin, attorney for the Powells and Schuman,
                                petitioned the U.S. District Court in San Francisco on January 2,
                                1957 for court validation of his passport to allow travel to
                                mainland China and North Korea since the Department of State had
                                refused such validation despite the fact that he would be traveling
                                as an officer of the court to collect depositions. On January 25
                                Judge Louis E. Goodman responded that he lacked authority to
                                instruct the Department of State to take an action which would
                                affect the conduct of U.S. foreign relations. At the same time, a
                                spokesman of the People’s Republic of China indicated that Wirin, as
                                an officer of the court, would be representing the United States and
                                his passport would have to be validated by the U.S. Government
                                before he could be admitted into China. The details of the Powell

                            that the United States Government should communicate with the Chinese
                            Communist authorities concerning his travel. (Copies of the defense

                            judge that the Geneva talks would be a suitable channel for
                            communicating with the Communists concerning his travel. The Department
                            of Justice attorney who is handling the Washington end of the case
                            informed us that the judge categorically turned down Wirin’s request for
                            a court order that his passport be validated for travel to Communist
                            China and North Korea. The judge said he had no authority to issue such
                            an order. The judge is reportedly unsympathetic to Wirin’s latest
                            gambit. He has asked that appropriate government authorities provide him
                            with an affidavit setting forth the United States Government’s position
                            with regard to the Chinese Communist and North Korean regimes, travel by
                            Americans to those areas and the facts concerning the Geneva talks. We
                            are preparing material on these subjects for Justice, which will then
                            prepare the affidavit A hearing is set for February 2, when the judge
                            will consider this information.</p>
                        <p>It seems clear that the Chinese Communists are using the Powell case as
                            another lever to compel a change in our policy regarding travel to
                            Mainland China. They probably feel that they are in a strong position in
                            this case, since if the U.S. Government blocks Wirin’s travel to
                            Communist China, there is a good chance that the case against the
                            Powells will be dismissed. Thus, whichever way we move, the Communist
                            movement would stand to gain. Peiping’s tactics in this case strongly
                            suggest that they are not interested in utilizing the Powell case to
                            revive the germ warfare charges against the U.S. If they were, they
                            would certainly be more inclined to facilitate <pb n="470"
                                xml:id="pg_470" facs="0498"/>Wirin’s travel. Their propaganda, too,
                            has supported this conclusion, since they have played up the Powell case
                            as another attempt by the U.S. to persecute journalists who try to tell
                            the truth about Communist China. Germ warfare has been barely mentioned.
                            We are giving Justice the information we have on the various efforts by
                            Peiping to break down our passport policy, so that they can pass this
                            background informally to the judge.</p>

                        <p>I am much troubled by our attitude toward mainland China, although I am
                            prepared to agree with much of our official doctrine on the perfidy of
                            the Chinese Communists and their general inimical attitude. A large
                            number of our allies and practically all of the so-called uncommitted
                            governments do not share our views. The time is inevitably coming when
                            the government in Peking by a purely procedural vote of the General
                            Assembly will be seated in the United Nations as being directly
                            representative of the people of China, and when that time comes whoever
                            is the American Secretary of State (and possibly the head of the Policy
                            Planning Staff with him) is <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0499"
                            />going to be hauled over the coals by certain powerful elements of
                            American public opinion.</p>
                        <p>Another famous Republican Secretary of State, <persName>Charles Evans
                                Hughes</persName>, once established a fairly simple doctrine on
                            recognition. It had nothing to do with emotion. The criteria established
                            by Secretary <persName>Hughes</persName> were that a government must be
                            in effective control of the territory of the state concerned; that it
                            must have, by and large, the clear support of its people; and that it
                            must honor its obligations under international law. With the exception
                            of the final point it could be said by this standard the government in
                            Peking is already qualified for recognition. However, that is a matter
                            of bilateral concern to the United States and China and I am addressing
                            the tenor of this paper largely to what we should do given the postulate
                            that sooner or later Red China will be admitted to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt at all that once the Peking Government is seated in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> it will redound greatly to the
                            prestige of that Government. The acceptance of Peking’s credentials by
                            the General Assembly will result in an increase of de jure recognition
                            of the Peking regime by a number of governments who, largely through
                            suasion by the United States, have thus far refrained from such
                            recognition. In an Asia which still attaches great importance to “face”,
                            the entry of mainland China to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            will have a great impact. However, this is something which is going to
                            happen and there is no use wringing our hands and ordering the tide to
                            go back. King <persName>Canute</persName> got his feet wet when he tried
                            that.</p>
                        <p>It can likewise be argued that it would be most unfortunate to have a
                            Communist China represented in the Security Council rather than a
                            representative of Nationalist China who on most issues can be counted on
                            to vote our way. However, I believe the danger of having a Chinese
                            Communist in the Security Council can easily be exaggerated since two
                            vetoes can be no worse than one. Likewise it can be argued with
                            considerable effectiveness that our insistence that the representative
                            of Taiwan in fact speaks in the name of the Chinese people is a
                            violation of the Charter, since it was the clear intent at San Francisco
                            that the five permanent members represent what was then regarded to be
                            the five great powers and this clearly does not describe the Security
                            Council representative of Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that before the Bandung powers and certain of our own
                            allies vote mainland China into the United Nations, we might seek to
                            extract such diplomatic advantage from an untenable situation as can be
                            found. At this late date the chief benefit we possibly can derive by
                            negotiation would be to secure effective guarantees that only a peaceful
                            solution of the Taiwan problem shall be resorted to by either side. We
                            might likewise secure at least a public pledge possibly backed by <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> guarantees (and in this India would <pb
                                n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0500"/>primarily be interested), that
                            China would not seek to change its frontier, nor would it aid limitrophe
                            nations in changing their frontiers, by force. This would have immediate
                            application in North Korea, North Vietnam, Burma and Laos with a more
                            residual application in Tibet and Nepal.</p>
                        <p>Such a negotiation could at a minimum be based on assurance by the United
                            States that it would withdraw its present adamantine opposition to the
                            entry of Communist China into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            even though if for purposes of the record we might not vote in favor of
                            such admission. If the bargaining got more sticky we might contemplate
                            raising the ante to include recognition.<note n="2" xml:id="d232fn2"
                                >Yesterday, in conversation with Congressman Zablocki, I asked what
                                he thought American public opinion was in respect to Red China. He
                                said that he and several other Congressmen were startled at a
                                meeting of American businessmen held fully two years ago at which he
                                judged that 75% of the persons present favored increased trade with
                                Red China, and recognition as an adjunct to facilitating such trade.
                                He quoted Representative Mrs. <persName>Kelly</persName>, who was
                                present at the meeting, as remarking to him, “Well, I’ll be
                                God-damned!” [Footnote in the source text.]</note></p>
                        <p>Once Communist China is admitted to the United Nations it will be so
                            generally recognized by other governments that we might as well follow
                            suit, utilizing to the extent possible our readiness to recognize, to
                            round off the rough edges of any modus vivendi we negotiate with Peking.
                            Among the incidental advantages to reckon on from a policy planning
                            aspect, one can cite the very important advantage of having an Embassy
                            in Peking. Although our presence diplomatically speaking in Moscow is
                            not going to change the Soviet way of life, certainly the judgments
                            provided us by the Moscow Embassy are of immense value in estimating the
                            direction Soviet policy will take. A similar benefit would be derived
                            from an Embassy in Peking and this might prove of crucial importance if
                            as many believe China in future years will assert a decisive influence
                            on the trend of Russian policy.</p>
                        <p>In such a negotiation it will, of course, be essential to provide
                            safeguards for the integrity of the new Republic of Taiwan. It should,
                            however, be perfectly easy among the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            membership to arrange for the admission of Taiwan as a member in its own
                            right. We would thus come to the policy of “the two Chinas,” and the
                            continuous wrangle in Credentials Committees of various international
                            organizations, whereby we call black white and yellow red in insisting
                            that the Nationalist Government of Taiwan speaks for 600 million
                            mainland Chinese, would at last be ended.</p>
                        <p>It goes without saying that in the course of accepting the Peking regime
                            into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, steps would be taken to end
                            the state of hostilities between that regime and the Governments which
                            fought in Korea under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> aegis.
                            Advantage could be taken of this negotiation <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473"
                                facs="0501"/>to secure guarantees of the neutrality of the two
                            Koreas and the two Vietnams, and further safeguards if necessary for
                            Taiwan. It would be helpful in this connection to enlist Japan and India
                            as guarantor powers. Ultimately if this course of action were followed
                            we might find it possible to reduce the present astronomical dollar
                            contributions which the US is making to such amputated patients as South
                            Korea, South Vietnam and Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>I realize that the foregoing is an analysis based more on pragmatism than
                            principle. However, as Confucius did not say, “if you are going to be
                            raped you might as well relax and enjoy it.”</p>

                            newspaper men to Communist China have not been very favorable for us.
                            The press is giving strong support to Stevens and Worthy. Apparently
                            they have been able to whip up a certain amount of public support for
                            their position. Worthy appeared on Eric Sevareid’s nation wide newscast
                            Sunday afternoon February 10 and probably evoked quite a bit of sympathy
                            for his position. Worthy left Moscow before the Embassy received our
                            instructions, and he refused to submit his passport to the Legation in
                            Budapest for restrictive endorsement. He also refused to say yes or no
                            on the passport hearing which was offered him, placing his case in the
                            hands of the Civil Liberties Union. When Worthy passed through
                            Immigration at Boston his passport (by decision) was not taken up or
                            restrictively endorsed. As I see it this will make it difficult for us
                            to follow through in Stevens’ case. <hi rend="italic">Look</hi> magazine
                            plans to fight the case of Stevens and Harrington. Presumably there will
                            be a passport hearing in Washington when Stevens returns to this
                            country. Stevens was given the choice of a hearing in Moscow or
                            Washington before restrictive action was taken, and Look magazine
                            instructed him to choose a hearing in Washington, which will presumably
                            take place a few weeks hence.</p>
                        <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0502"/>
                        <p>The decision to seek to restrict the passports was taken with some
                            reluctance in view of the legal uncertainty but our hand was more or
                            less forced by the press release of December 28<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d233fn2">See <ref target="#d226">Document 226</ref>.</note>
                            in which it was stated flatly that the passports would be made valid for
                            return to the U.S. only. We did soften the proposed action by making it
                            clear to our Embassy in Moscow that we did not require Stevens to come
                            home. The instruction was to endorse the passport “upon departure from
                            the Soviet Union, valid for return to the U.S. only”. This would enable
                            Stevens to continue his assignment in the U.S.S.R. without interruption.
                            However <hi rend="italic">Look</hi> has elected to bring him home in
                            late March in order to fight the case.</p>
                        <p>We are faced with a flat defiance of the Department by Worthy, and strong
                            resistence short of defiance in the case of <hi rend="italic">Look</hi>
                            magazine and Stevens.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary took a very strong position in his press conference of
                            February 5.<note n="3" xml:id="d233fn3"><p>At a press conference on
                                    February 5, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                        >Dulles</persName> was asked to give his philosophy
                                    concerning the policy of denying American reporters passport
                                    authorization to travel to mainland China. He responded:</p>
                                <p>“Well, my philosophy is, I think, in that respect the same as the
                                    President expressed at a recent press conference, that we don’t
                                    like to have American citizens used as a means of coercion as
                                    against the United States Government. As you know, of course,
                                    the Chinese Communist Government has for some time been trying
                                    to get reporters—preferably those it picked—to come into
                                    Communist China, and it has repeatedly tried to use the illegal
                                    detention of Americans in Communist China as a means of pressure
                                    to accomplish its ends in that respect. We do not think that it
                                    is sound philosophy to permit other governments—other regimes—to
                                    feel that it is profitable business for them to withhold and
                                    detain illegally and throw into jail American citizens so they
                                    can put a price on their release. If we allow that to happen in
                                    one case, then I think the safety of all Americans throughout
                                    the world is lowered by several degrees for a long time in the
                                    future. It is a fact that the Chinese Communists are trying to
                                    use Americans to accomplish that end, which makes us reluctant
                                    to do it. If the Americans were released, then we would, of
                                    course, give a new look at the situation.” (Department of State

                            for a passport to go to Communist China. The Judge has requested Justice
                            to submit briefs on two questions as follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Whether the Court possesses the power to compel the Secretary

                        <p>We armed Justice with quite a bit of material for the meeting which the

                        <p>The Secretary agreed to hold a meeting with a small group representing
                            the press and asked Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                                >Herter</persName> to make the arrangements. He thought Monday
                                afternoon<note n="2" xml:id="d234fn2">The meeting took place on
                                Monday, February 18. See <ref target="#d237">Document
                                237</ref>.</note> would be the best time.</p>
                        <p>In agreeing to the meeting, the Secretary said that the best possible and
                            most complete and articulate statement of our policy on this subject
                            should be pulled together as a basis of his discussion and that of the
                            other Departmental participants. Essentially the Secretary felt that our
                            policy was entirely correct but that it would have validity only if it
                            was effective and it would only be effective if it was really “saleable”
                            to the American people. Conversely the Secretary felt that we should not
                            hold to this or any other policy which was not understood and not
                            supported by the American people.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recognized that the newspaper correspondents were only one
                            group of the American people concerned with the problem of entry into
                            Communist China; that missionaries, businessmen, etc, were also
                            involved. He thought however that a special problem was created by the
                            journalists as representing the source of news on Communist China and
                            also because they were so conspicuously in the forefront of those
                            involved in pursuing the policy; that therefore the proposed meeting
                            should not include representatives of groups other than the press and
                            radio.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed with the point made by most of the participants that
                            we had not yet articulated properly the policies under which we were
                            operating in this area, i.e., the relationship with Communist China in
                            terms of admission of U.S. citizens, and that we therefore had not had
                            any success in selling the policy. He looked to the proposed meeting as
                            a testing ground from this standpoint, to take high-minded,
                            public-spirited and interested people and put to them our policy with
                            the greatest force and see whether it would stand up.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary at the outset of the meeting had read Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName>’s brief (dated February 8<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d234fn3">Not found in Department of State
                                files.</note>) and made extensive comments upon it, principally
                            along the lines that, while the document was an able marshalling of the
                            elements of the problem, it overlooked, it seemed to him, the most
                            important basis for our present policy. He pointed out that the
                            strongest single motivation of the Chinese in their international
                            conduct was a desire to be treated like everyone else and that our
                            unwillingness to concede to them in this had been the greatest sanction
                            upon them which we held. The Secretary believes <pb n="478"
                                xml:id="pg_478" facs="0506"/>that we should not accede to their
                            desire until they have earned it in the sense of demonstrating a
                            determination to conduct themselves properly and in accord with
                            international law and custom.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed serious concern on two other elements of the
                            problem. In the first place, he saw that a concession on the particular
                            issue of the correspondents was the first step in a long slippery path
                            on which he saw little possibility of halting; the missionaries and
                            businessmen and then tourists would follow upon the correspondents. In
                            the second place, he was sure that any revision in our present policy
                            would be wrongly interpreted in a number of areas but particularly in
                            those countries whose morale we spent much energy to bolster because of
                            their closeness and yet their resistance to Communist China, i.e.,
                            Korea, Formosa and Southeast Asia; these would assume that this was
                            simply the first step to recognition of Communist China and their
                            reaction would be one of great nervousness.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary made this further comment. He felt that there was no doubt
                            whatsoever that, if we can keep the correspondents out of Communist
                            China, it was in the best interest of the U.S. He was not sure however
                            that, as with the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> controls,
                            it might not be better to have violations than to agree to a
                            relaxation.</p>

                            our attitude toward Americans going to Communist China. He said he had
                            narrated to the group the various evil deeds of the Chinese Communists,
                            culminating in their attempting to use 10 Americans as hostages to gain
                            political ends. He said the group felt that the full story had never
                            been adequately told to the American people, and that if it were, they
                            would understand better why we did not issue passports for China and
                            discouraged travel to Communist China. I recalled to <pb n="479"
                                xml:id="pg_479" facs="0507"/>the President that we were planning a
                            meeting with some of the newspaper heads on Monday to discuss this
                            matter fully.<note n="3" xml:id="d235fn3">See <ref target="#d237"
                                    >Document 237</ref>.</note> The President suggested that I could
                            discuss it again at my next press conference and he would do the same.
                            The President said he felt that if we could get the full story across,
                            public reaction would support our position. The President said that
                            under present conditions he would never see the issue of passports valid
                            for China. The President said he recognized that we might have to
                            tolerate a certain amount of “bootleg” travel there.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Secretary welcomed the group saying that he was appreciative of the
                            opportunity of discussing frankly with them our policy on travel of
                            Americans in Communist China. He recognized that we had perhaps not put
                            forward as convincing a case as we should, in part because not all of it
                            could be made public, and in part perhaps because we may not have
                            considered all of the elements ourselves. In this latter respect he
                            looked for the meeting to be helpful, and he hoped the meeting might
                            come to some accord.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then developed the factors underlying our policy and
                            notably the fact that we were in a state of semi-warfare with Communist
                            China resulting from the Korean hostilities and technically at warfare
                            in the sense of the still-existing orders and regulations. <pb n="482"
                                xml:id="pg_482" facs="0510"/>He touched upon the continuing threat
                            of warfare and the violation of the armistice by the Chinese
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that over and above the argumentation that the
                            gentlemen had undoubtedly heard often, there were two factors which he
                            wanted to impress upon them which they might not have considered as
                            thoroughly: <list>
                                <label>(a)</label>
                                <item>First was the effect upon third countries, notably the
                                    anti-Communist countries of the Pacific and Southeast Asia, of
                                    any policy of permitting U.S. citizens to go to Communist China
                                    apparently with the U.S. Government’s blessing. He described the
                                    difficulty which the maintenance of the morale of these
                                    countries presented to the U.S. and contrasted it with the
                                    European countries a few years back when Communism threatened,
                                    pointing out the lack of “depth” in resistance of these Far
                                    Eastern countries and their constant vulnerability to Communist
                                    pressure and to neutralism. Any indication of softening on the
                                    part of the U.S. would have extremely serious
                                    repercussions—tending to discourage those who oppose Communism
                                    and to encourage those ready to make an accommodation with the
                                    Communist Chinese. The Secretary developed the point that, as
                                    with Western Europe at one time, Communism was thought to be the
                                    “wave of the future” whereas now in Europe this has been changed
                                    and freedom is the “wave of the future.” In the satellites there
                                    is evidence that freedom is surviving. In contrast there is no
                                    comparable feeling of resistance to the wave of the future
                                    attitude in the Pacific and Southeast Asia and it is therefore
                                    necessary to uphold the neighboring countries and this poses a
                                    difficult task.</item>
                                <label>(b)</label>
                                <item>The cultural exchanges and traveling of Americans into
                                    Communist China is of such importance because the Chinese
                                    Communists, even as the Russians, seek this more than anything
                                    else in order to give themselves a sense of respectability that
                                    they do not have when they are on the U.S. forbidden list. Even
                                    more important, if they achieve cultural exchange with the U.S.
                                    then they can use it most effectively with the less strong
                                    neighboring countries. We can presumably trust the Americans who
                                    would participate in a cultural exchange, particularly the
                                    reporters, but the representatives of the weaker countries are
                                    far more vulnerable. Thus, the Secretary said, if we change our
                                    position and treat the Chinese Communists as respectable members
                                    of the international community, even though they have done
                                    nothing to earn it, the net effect in his view would be to
                                    weaken our overall anti-Communist position.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Secretary then pointed out that he did not believe any policy
                            revision could be limited to newspapermen; the admission of newspapermen
                            would soon lead to missionaries, educators, businessmen and others in
                            the area of cultural exchange.</p>
                        <p>Addressing the relationship of this problem to the prisoners held by the
                            Chinese, the Secretary reviewed briefly the history of the prisoner
                            problem. He mentioned the assertion by the Communist press after the
                            failure to achieve a <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                            meeting that they, the Communists, would be more lenient when the U.S.
                            attitude <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0511"/>on cultural exchanges
                            was revised. The clear implication, the Secretary said, was that if we
                            let newspapermen into Communist China, and perhaps others, it would
                            constitute a revision sufficient to warrant the release of the
                            prisoners. The Secretary quoted (and Mr. <persName>Jones</persName>
                            asked for a specific citation) of the 14th of February 1957

                            Chinese in the Geneva talks that it was not even necessary for the
                            Communists to make reply to the Secretary’s statements on February 5
                            since “the American press had already done the job for them.” The
                            Secretary said that it made his blood boil to observe such bargaining
                            and that he was not ready to permit the Chinese Communists to make it
                            seem profitable to use captive Americans in this way. In this connection
                            he reminded the group that it was the Chinese Communists who connected
                            the issue of the prisoners with the correspondents in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary told the group that the President feels strongly on this
                            issue even though a contrary impression seems to prevail that the policy
                            is <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Walter Robertson</persName>’s or his. He
                            related that only a few evenings ago the President, following a
                            discussion with some of his hunting associates at Thomasville, got
                            sufficiently steamed up on the issue to call him and point out
                            emphatically that he does not want to change his policy with the
                            circumstances as they presently are.<note n="3" xml:id="d237fn3"><p>As
                                    recorded by the Secretary’s Personal Assistant,

                                    the Secretary had the following telephone conversation on
                                    February 13 on the question of permitting newspapermen to travel

                                <p>“The Pres asked if we have any change from the Chinese on those
                                    10? No. The Pres mentioned allowing newspaper people in. The Sec
                                    referred to the mtg yesterday and Monday etc. We have word from
                                        <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> at Geneva
                                    that this business is weakening our position there. We can’t
                                    maintain our position if we can’t persuade the newspaper people
                                    of the lightness of our position. The Pres said then we close
                                    our eyes to it. The Sec said <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                                        >Herter</persName> is doing it. The Pres said it is too bad.

                                    get the newspaper people in and will hold them for something

                        <p>The Secretary touched upon the troubles which arose from a slow erosion
                            of our policy and in this connection cited Senator
                                <persName>Green</persName>’s announcement today that the Chinese
                            Communists should be recognized sooner or later.<note n="4"

                        <p>Also to show the effect of erosion, the Secretary described the
                            difficulties which the Government had experienced on <gloss
                                target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> with the pressures exerted by
                            other governments for a relaxation of the trade controls. After full and
                            careful thought, the US had decided not to agree to liberalization even
                            though bootlegging activity would thus be increased, simply because of
                            the political impact of U.S. participation in such liberalization on the
                            important anti-communist countries close to Communist China. The
                            Secretary feared, along the <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0512"
                            />same lines of erosion, that with the inevitable passing of the elder,
                            strong anti-Communists, such as <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName>, leaders motivated by less deep conviction might
                            permit a weakening which could lead to a loss of the countries without
                            fighting.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded by citing the allegory from St. Paul that it is
                            not a question of one’s own ability to take the strong meat and drink
                            but whether one’s taking of it “may be a stumbling block to them that
                            are weak.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, at the Secretary’s
                            invitation, enlarged upon the Secretary’s presentation. He pointed out
                            particularly that we are not afraid of the reporting which will be
                            forthcoming if U.S. correspondents go into China. He also said the
                            Chinese Communists know full well the U.S. position and know that no
                            Congressman has heretofore been able to see his way to come out for
                            recognition; but the Chinese Communists are playing for Asia. He
                            similarly emphasized the point that this was a policy for Americans
                            generally, not just newspapermen.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> then presented a
                            chronology of Chinese Communist actions starting from the repudiation of
                            all commitments on coming to power, the Korean invasion, the support on
                            Viet Minh and undermining of Indo China, the negotiations for the
                            release of the fliers, including the “play” for the travel of the
                            mothers, the Geneva Conference and the subsequent Geneva meetings of
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName>. He reemphasized the Secretary’s
                            point that the Chinese Communists through all this were desperately
                            seeking respectability and were seeking to attack us by subverting Asia
                            first.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from Mr. <persName>Jones</persName>, the
                            Secretary reminded the group that it was the Chinese Communists who had
                            related the problem of prisoners to the travel of correspondents and
                            that this had made it considerably more difficult to lift the ban on
                            travel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Jones</persName> stated that he did not believe that the
                            removal of the prohibition on the travel of newspapermen would mean it
                            had to be removed for others. He pointed out that reporters do go
                            everywhere when they are permitted (e.g., foxholes in wartime) and
                            reporters now resent being made an instrument of foreign policy. Mr.
                                <persName>Jones</persName> also took issue with the comparison with
                            the European analogy made by the Secretary and said that the continued
                            presence of reporters in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> when
                            the rest of Europe was weak did not hurt our effort to strengthen
                            anti-Communist forces and indeed probably helped it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Jones</persName> said that he strongly disagreed with those
                            who said that the Department should be defied and travel should be
                            undertaken by correspondents despite the ban. He also said that there
                            should be a passport control. The trouble was that the control in this
                            instance was not right and appropriate.</p>
                        <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0513"/>
                        <p>There was an inconclusive exchange of comments on whether the presence of
                            our embassies in satellite countries which we recognize did assist our
                            people and the <persName>Oatis</persName> case was cited.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d237fn6"><persName>William N. Oatis</persName> was the
                                Associated Press correspondent in Prague, Czechoslovakia when he was
                                arrested on espionage charges in April 1951. He was convicted and
                                sentenced to 10 years in prison. After vigorous American protests,
                                he was released in May 1953. For documentation relating to the

                                    Part 2, pp. 1338</ref> ff.</note> The Secretary pointed out that
                                <persName>Oatis</persName> was gotten out without submitting to
                            blackmail. It was generally agreed, however, that there was no real
                            danger to be feared for the safety of reporters if they went to
                            China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that the
                            case with Russia was different in that we were not at war with Russia
                            nor were the Russians holding U.S. prisoners and using them as hostages.
                            He also reminded Mr. <persName>Jones</persName> that newspapermen do not
                            go anywhere; the particular right of the newspapermen was to publish—and
                            the Department strongly upheld this principle—not the right to go
                            anywhere.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight</persName> made reference to the
                            ANPA resolution<note n="7" xml:id="d237fn7">See <ref target="#d233fn5"
                                    >footnote 5, Document 233</ref>.</note> which he said had not
                            been taken lightly and was motivated by the feeling that we would be the
                            stronger through more knowledge. He would, however, agree with the
                            Secretary that it would be difficult to limit the travel to reporters;
                            this was, however, a calculated risk from which he thought we would get
                            a net gain. The Secretary felt that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Dwight</persName> should give more thought to the impact upon the
                            anti-Communist neighbor countries, to which argument the Secretary had
                            alluded earlier.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to the question of reporters from other
                            countries in Communist China. The Secretary pointed out that from the
                            political standpoint the action of the U.S. in permitting admission was
                            the only one that really mattered to the anti-Communist neighbor
                            countries; these countries looked to us and were wholly dependent upon
                            the U.S. determination not to recognize and not to make deals which
                            would give respectability to the Chinese Communists. These countries had
                            demonstrated an indifference to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                            French actions with respect to trade controls and a complete respect and
                            dependence upon the U.S. position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight</persName> reemphasized his view
                            that an informed U.S. public is the strongest weapon against Communist
                            China and that the American public only has real confidence in American
                            reporters.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Luce</persName> asked when the last time the President or
                            the Secretary had given a forceful public presentation of the Chinese
                            Communist crimes comparable to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>’s eloquent presentation. He said that although
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> had frequently
                            spoken publicly on this subject, he thought there was a need for the
                            President or the Secretary <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0514"/>to
                            speak more often on it even though there still existed in the U.S. an
                            overwhelmingly strong sentiment against Communist China. Mr.
                                <persName>Luce</persName> said he put this forward as a related
                            element because of his fear that the dangerous situation would “unravel”
                            even by such weakening moves as Senator <persName>Green</persName>’s
                            suggestion on recognition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Jones</persName> reverted to the comparison of the European
                            situation and pointed out that even at the time of the Berlin blockade,
                            which was a very real violation of agreements and a serious threat to
                            the U.S. and the West, there was no talk of pulling out the
                            correspondents. He also quoted from an official State Department press
                            statement of a few years back concerning a revision in the travel
                            authority granted for Americans going into the satellites in which
                            travel was specifically not forbidden, but travelers were requested to
                            consult with the Department. This he thought would be appropriate for
                            the Chinese Communist situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary tried to explain the dilemma in which the Department found
                            itself when addressing the problem of the anxiety of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China to gain approval
                            and respect through recognition and cultural exchange. He cited the
                            example of the Summit. The actual evaluation of gain or loss he would
                            leave to historians but it was undeniable that the Communists had gained
                            tremendously and exploited the gain by being able to show all over the
                            Communist world pictures of the President of the United States with
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMNA1">Bulganin</persName>. In weighing the
                            gains and losses inherent in this situation, the Secretary said that he
                            was convinced there was a very great gain for us in maintaining our
                            position and in not giving respectability to the Communist Chinese in
                            the fashion they wished through admission of the correspondents and
                            other travelers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Luce</persName> raised the point that the admission of
                            correspondents to Communist China represents a change on their part also
                            since correspondents were banned from China in 1949. In this same
                            connection, Mr. <persName>Jones</persName> cited an October 1949 press
                            statement from the Department that said the effect of the Chinese ban on
                            correspondents from Communist China was to blot out the free press in
                            order to force recognition; thus there seems to be a reversal of the
                            positions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed
                            out that this was, however, prior to the Korean War and the
                            circumstances were considerably different now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Jones</persName> noted that we did not withdraw
                            correspondents or take comparable steps at the time of the Russian
                            atrocity in Hungary. The Secretary pointed out that we had sharply
                            curbed our cultural exchanges and to do otherwise would have been
                            unthinkable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Hurleigh</persName> pointed out that he had been unable to
                            get an expression of views on this matter from his association members
                            so that his statement was speaking personally but he believed very
                            strongly that the Department’s and the Secretary’s position was entirely
                                <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0515"/>correct and that at least
                            his network would, following this meeting, try even more to clarify the
                            position to the American people. He saw American newsmen simply as
                            Americans in this proposition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Luce</persName> indicated that he had not taken any
                            definite position for himself or for the people whom he “more or less
                            represented” but that he was inclined to follow the position of the two
                            newspaper associations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized once more his inability to let down the barriers
                            for certain newspaper people and then draw the line against the travel
                            of other Americans. Instead he saw that any weakening of the position
                            would be a breakdown in our whole policy and therefore an achievement by
                            the Chinese Communists of cultural exchanges which they so much desire
                            and would view as a complete victory. The Secretary again expressed his
                            regret that the more compelling parts of this argument could not be made
                            public, notably the extremely difficult morale problem related to the
                            neighboring anti-Communist countries who face the all-pervasive power
                            and culture of a Communist China in the area. He was convinced that a
                            change in our policy would make our whole problem in the area very much
                            more difficult.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Luce</persName> left the meeting stating that he would like
                            to concert with Messrs. <persName>Jones</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight</persName> and possibly respond to the
                            Secretary in a report, which probably should be one to be held in
                            confidence.</p>
                        <p>In response to an inquiry from Mr. <persName>Jones</persName>, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> explained that of
                            the 10 prisoners 8 were missionaries and 2 were civilian employees of
                            the Defense Department who had been in a downed airplane flying, as he
                            recalled it, from Formosa to Japan. However, he pointed out that the
                            “innocence” of these men was not at issue since the Chinese Communists
                            had, after full examination and discussion of the individuals, agreed
                            that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> would be released.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed appreciation for the opportunity to discuss this
                            critically important and difficult situation with these people and to
                            have been able to tell them of our reasoning and thinking. He hoped that
                            they would think over the whole situation, including especially those
                            facets of the problem which he had pointed out were an essential element
                            in the formulation of the policy but which were not as well known as the
                            equally important elements involving the press coverage. He wanted the
                            group to think carefully over the matter before expressing to him any
                            further views.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu Ta-Wei</persName> called at his
                            request, following three months of medical treatment in this country,
                            and on the eve of his return to Taipei. He said that he was concerned at
                            the rapid increase in Chinese Communist capabilities for attack against
                            Taiwan. He did not know whether a Communist assault against Taiwan or
                            the off-shore islands was probable. But the capability was there and it
                            was growing every month. The Chinese Communists had made great
                            sacrifices in order to expedite completion of the railroad into Amoy and
                            Foochow. They had also exerted themselves in order to speed completion
                            of the system of forward air bases in the coastal area of Fukien
                            Province. These bases were not now occupied, but they could be occupied
                            almost overnight. He thought these forward bases would be used for
                            fighter planes which would be used to protect the heavy bombers which,
                            with their longer range, would come from rear bases around Nanching and
                            other places farther west. The Minister thought that the Chinese
                            Communists had sacrificed part of their industrial mobilization <pb
                                n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0517"/>scheme in Manchuria, and in
                            Yumen and elsewhere in west China in order to accelerate the build up of
                            military capabilities opposite Taiwan. The Communists must have
                            something pretty definite in mind in order to give this high priority to
                            the South China build up in the face of strong competing demands
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said it would be very useful to the commanders of the
                            garrisons on Quemoy and Matsu if more could be known of the U.S.
                            military plans in the event of a Chinese Communist attack on the
                            off-shore islands. The Chinese Commanders would plan differently for a
                            one-week campaign without assistance than they would for a holding
                            action of indefinite duration without assistance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> reminded General
                                <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> that the President was
                            fully empowered under the Joint Resolution of January 29, 1955<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d239fn2">See <ref target="frus1955-57v02#d56">vol. <hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, Document 56</ref>.</note> to make
                            this decision, and the President alone could make it. The President
                            would have to make a decision in the light of all the circumstances at
                            the time as to whether an attack of that sort were related to the
                            security of Taiwan. The Chinese Government should not anticipate any
                            decision in the matter in advance, because it could not be forthcoming.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> offered to give the
                            Minister a copy of the Joint Resolution of Congress, but the Minister
                            said the Resolution was his “Bible” and he did not need to see a copy of
                            it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> expressed some
                            skepticism as to whether a Chinese Communist attack was probable, but
                            agreed that it was a possibility which the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> had to reckon with.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> said that he felt that
                            his work of rebuilding and expanding the Chinese Army was now about
                            finished, enabling him to concentrate on strategic problems. He felt
                            that his work of converting the Chinese Army from a poorly organized
                            group of mercenaries into a modern well-trained force was his greatest
                            achievement. He felt he would be remembered for this after everything
                            else he had done was forgotten. He described how the conscription system
                            worked. All 20-year old men, both Taiwanese and Mainlanders, were
                            automatically conscripted for 2 years. They were given 4 months of basic
                            training in nine combat regiments, then 20 months of active duty in the
                            21 regular divisions. After the completion of the 2 years of active
                            service, the draftees were placed in the active reserve for several
                            years. The active reserve maintained 9 reserve divisions. He said that
                            this system of training had brought the average age of the soldier down
                            to 26 years, and it would soon be further reduced to 24 years. Morale
                            was excellent and the Taiwanese were serving without complaint, on a
                            basis of friendship and non-discrimination, with the Mainlanders. The
                            system had enabled the Government to bring the 21 active divisions
                            almost to full strength. The seven divisions on <pb n="490"
                                xml:id="pg_490" facs="0518"/>Quemoy and Matsu were at full strength
                            or slightly over, and the 14 divisions on Taiwan would soon be at about
                            95%.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> said that he felt it was
                            essential to expedite the completion of the Matador missile project. His
                            Government had regretted the premature publicity which came from
                            American military sources. Since the information had been released, he
                            felt it was important to get on with the exchange of notes and the
                            actual installation. He had been told at the Pentagon that the project
                            had been given complete approval there, and that the next move was up to
                            the State Department.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1"
                                >McConaughy</persName> stated that no agency was holding up the
                            project. Both Defense and State agreed that the project should be pushed
                            vigorously. There had been some technical obstacles to be overcome. We
                            were working on the formal exchange of notes, and we expected to be able
                            to move rapidly from this point on.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> said he was also anxious
                            to see the Kung Kuan airfield project pushed more aggressively. He said
                            this air base actually would be principally for American use, and he
                            thought it was in the U.S. interest to proceed with the construction
                            with a minimum of delay. He feared that budgetary problems might have
                            caused some loss of valuable time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> assured him that we
                            were fully committed to pushing the undertaking with all possible speed.
                            No serious financial difficulty was anticipated.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> said that he felt Taiwan
                            was seriously deficient in defense against air attack. The 90-mm
                            aircraft guns could not reach the high altitude modern Communist planes,
                            such as the Soviets were supplying to the Chinese Communists. He said
                            that the best U.S. anti-aircraft devices were needed to protect Taiwan.
                            He expressed the hope that “Nike” missiles could be installed in the
                            near future. He said that electronic equipment on Taiwan needed to be
                            modernized and expanded. The modern war plane was sustained by
                            electronic aids just as completely as the sailing ship of old was
                            supported by the water. The best electronic equipment would be needed
                            both to track and intercept enemy planes and to support our own. He
                            included better radar in this reference to electronic equipment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> told General
                                <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> that the matters he had
                            dealt with fell largely in the military sphere, but we too were of
                            course interested in improving the defense capabilities on Taiwan. We
                            were confident that these matters would receive thorough consideration
                            in the Department of Defense.</p>

                                        Non-Communist Asians are increasingly sensitive to Peiping’s
                                        preponderant military power and rapid economic growth.
                                        Neither of its potential rivals, India or Japan, exerts a
                                        successful counter-influence in the area. Elsewhere, most of
                                        the other Free Asian states, including India, have been

                                    of the report. It seemed to him that the statement on the rising
                                    position of Communist China fully accepted the view that
                                    Communist China represented the wave of the future for Asia and
                                    that we must accommodate ourselves to this alleged fact. Such
                                    views as to the wave of the future prevailed not so very long
                                    ago with respect to the Soviet Union in Europe, but certain
                                    things had happened, and happened quite recently, to make the
                                    situation appear quite otherwise. These same people <pb n="492"
                                        xml:id="pg_492" facs="0520"/>now feel that the wave of the
                                    future is with the Free World countries and not the Communist
                                    powers. Everywhere in the world the local Communist Parties have
                                    weakened, their discipline gone and their loyalty to Moscow
                                    seriously impaired. Indeed, Communist weakness generally had
                                    been so exposed that the Communist regimes could no longer even
                                    be sure of the loyalty of their own younger generations, who had
                                    been brought up with knowledge of nothing but Communist regimes.
                                    Thus Communism is not the wave of the future, but is rather a
                                    receding wave.</p>
                                <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> further
                                    predicted that developments would in the future come in
                                    Communist China which would just as effectively prove that
                                    Communism was not the wave of the future in Asia as events had
                                    already proved that Communism was not the wave of the future in
                                    Europe. Therefore, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                        >Dulles</persName> thought that there was no point
                                    whatsoever in the argument that we must make some kind of a
                                    bargain with Communist China in order to save Taiwan—for
                                    example, admitting Communist China into the United Nations. In
                                    the future—perhaps in one year, two years, five years—Communist
                                    China will be on the defensive. There is no need for the United
                                    States or the Free World, therefore, to accommodate to the
                                    Communist Chinese and give them what they want—the view which
                                    seems to be implicit in this section of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                            discussion that “the course of action which would most certainly
                            undermine the Chinese National Government on Taiwan and lose the island
                            to the Communists would be a general settlement between the United
                            States and Communist China”. The President agreed.</p>

                        <p>At the Gridiron Club Dinner I sat next to the head of the UP. He spoke to
                            me about the ban on newspaper people to China. He suggested the
                            possibility that some arrangement might be made whereby one or possibly
                            three persons would be agreed upon by all of the news media to go to
                            China on a reporting mission and that if it could be handled in this way
                            that would get away from the concept of a general breakdown of ostracism
                            of the Chinese Communists and a beginning of “cultural exchange”.</p>
                        <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0521"/>
                        <p>I said that if indeed the news media could agree upon one person or not
                            more than three to go to China on such a mission I thought we might be
                            able to set it up in a framework which would be free of the difficulties
                            which I had foreseen in any general relaxation of restrictions. I
                            invited him to explore this further and he said he would do so. I
                            likened the situation to where in time of war or under special
                            conditions the news agencies agreed upon a pooling of their resources
                            through one or a very limited number of persons.</p>
                        <p>I said I questioned whether the Chinese would accept this but
                            nevertheless it might be a good try.</p>

                            Matador flight on Taiwan and Penghu would serve our policy objectives by
                            giving further evidence of our determination to assist in the defense of
                            the islands, thereby enhancing the morale of our Chinese allies,
                            encouraging our other Asian allies, and serving as a further deterrent
                            to Chinese Communist aggression. For these reasons, this project was
                            approved in principle, and when brought to the attention of the Chinese,
                            it secured their immediate and enthusiastic oral concurrence.</p>

                        <p>At the time that this exchange of notes is being negotiated our
                            Ambassador would tell the Chinese that we would not expect them to

                            desirable to clarify this point with the Chinese, because in the past

                            assumed the Chinese authorities would provide them with the same
                            facilities it provides the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> with
                            respect to housing, office space and related items. It was not our
                            intention to request such facilities for other non-<gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> units when they were sent to Taiwan.
                            Defense has so informed the Services and it is advisable to reassure the
                            Chinese on this matter. This position is in conformity with our stand in
                            the status of forces negotiations.</p>

                                incentives and repression the regime will probably be able to
                                prevent popular discontent from becoming a significant factor in

                            <item>The position of the Chinese Communists in the Communist world has
                                been greatly enhanced as a result of developments since the death of
                                Stalin and particularly because of the prominent role they have
                                played in Bloc affairs in the past year. Peiping will probably
                                further increase its influence within the Communist Bloc and will
                                have an important voice in matters affecting the Bloc as a whole.
                                Communist China will continue to rely on the Bloc for the bulk of
                                its military and economic imports. Although it is probable that some
                                conflicts of interest and disagreements will develop between Moscow
                                and Peiping, it is highly unlikely that either will permit such
                                conflicts to impair Sino-Soviet solidarity. (<hi rend="italic"

                            <item>Communist China’s influence has increased markedly in the
                                non-Communist world, and its presence is especially felt in Asia.
                                The Chinese Communists have been able to create the impression in
                                much of non-Communist Asia that Communist China is a dynamic,
                                permanent, and perhaps not unfriendly world power, which it is
                                unwise to offend by too close alignment with the West. At the same
                                time, however, there is apprehension concerning Communist China’s
                                real intentions and a recognition, though seldom voiced publicly, of
                                the importance of the US in restraining Communist China from overt
                                aggression. (<hi rend="italic">Paras. 44, 54, 57–58</hi>)</item>

                            <item>The replacement of Western influence by Communist influence in
                                Asia will continue to be a major Chinese Communist objective. In its
                                approach to this objective and other international problems, Peiping
                                will probably try to avoid courses of action which it believes would
                                provoke US military intervention. It will remain hostile to the US,
                                and will not offer major concessions on basic issues. Nevertheless,
                                it will probably endeavor to appear conciliatory and flexible on
                                international issues. At the same time, it will continue its
                                subversive efforts, and will take advantage of opportunities for
                                Communist expansion, possibly including the extension of support to
                                armed revolts against non-Communist governments. Peiping will remain
                                determined to obtain control of Taiwan, but will almost certainly
                                not attempt to seize Taiwan by force so long as the US is committed
                                to its defense. (<hi rend="italic">Paras. 59–60, 62, 64</hi>)</item>

                                difficulties of increasing the amount of land under cultivation, the
                                regime’s success in increasing agricultural production will depend
                                largely on its ability to raise yields. The quality of the soil and
                                the supply of water are adequate to support a substantial increase
                                in output per acre, provided a heavy <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499"
                                    facs="0527"/>investment is made in fertilizers and irrigation.
                                However, we believe the total investment in agriculture included in
                                the Second Five Year Plan (1958–1962) is inadequate for achieving
                                the agricultural goals. State investment is largely limited to some
                                large scale flood control and irrigation projects. The bulk of the
                                investment, which will be for local projects, is to be provided by
                                the collectives from their own production, over and above their
                                contribution to the national budget.</item>
                            <label>31.</label>
                            <item>Whether the collectives will fulfill their goals will depend in
                                part on the peasants’ reaction to collectivization. During the first
                                year of full scale collectivization (1956), peasant reaction was not
                                unduly adverse, probably because of the prospects for a good crop
                                year. We believe a continuation of this attitude will depend largely
                                on whether the regime is able and willing to permit some increase in
                                the real earnings of the peasants. The prospect for a rising peasant
                                income will rest on the regime’s decisions regarding total national
                                expenditure and investments, and on the weather. We believe that the
                                regime, recognizing this problem of peasant incentive/will probably
                                make some concessions to the peasants, and cadres have already been
                                instructed to limit the investment, welfare, and reserve fund
                                allocations from the income of the collectives in order to maximize
                                direct payments to the peasants. This situation will tend to limit
                                the additional resources for investment which the regime can hope to
                                mobilize through its collectivization program, and in addition will
                                render the program vulnerable in the event farm output fails to
                                increase.</item>

                            <item>Even with adequate progress in capital formation, the regime will
                                still have the continuing problems of planning and of proper
                                allocation of investment. As the industrial sector becomes
                                integrated, orderly progress will depend on timely, realistic, and
                                accurate planning which avoids mistakes such as those which in 1956
                                resulted in shortages of cement and steel, shortfalls in petroleum
                                production, low quality of output in many industries, and shortages
                                of commodities for export. The planners must also act to end the
                                serious congestions and delays which have occurred on various
                                sections of the railroads.<note n="3" xml:id="d244fn3">See

                            <item>The shortage of trained personnel will continue to be another
                                problem of major proportions. The increase in investment, the
                                projected completion of new plants, and the progressive integration
                                of industry, are certain to accelerate the requirements for trained
                                personnel in industry. In particular, the Communists admit that the
                                development of necessary skills is the critical factor in the
                                establishment and expansion of such industries as chemical,

                                Plan period the educational system will find it difficult to provide
                                both for its own expansion and for the needs for trained personnel
                                in industry and agriculture. Moreover, the shortage of scientific
                                manpower will continue and scientific research and development will
                                remain limited.</item>
                            <label>34.</label>
                            <item>There will also be the problem of satisfying the increasing
                                requirements for essential imports of machinery and other
                                commodities. Further increases in production in almost all
                                industries will depend upon installations of new productive
                                capacity, much of which is to be furnished by the Soviet Bloc, but
                                some of which will come from the West. During the period of this
                                estimate, the Chinese Communist ability to import will be adversely
                                affected if, as it now appears, the Soviet Union extends no further
                                credits. It will also be adversely affected by the need to repay
                                outstanding Soviet credits and by the extension of grants and
                                credits to Asian Communist and non-Communist countries. Exports will
                                therefore have to be increased even more than imports, which will be
                                difficult in view of present problems in squeezing out agricultural
                                goods for export. Moreover, developments within the Soviet Union and
                                the European Satellites may have an important adverse impact on the
                                volume of imports from the Bloc and the timing of their arrival.
                                Delay or curtailment of scheduled installations as a result of
                                stresses within the Bloc could have a seriously depressing effect
                                upon the Chinese Communist rate of industrial growth. However, if
                                Western trade controls were relaxed the regime’s dependence on the
                                Bloc would be reduced and its import problems eased.<note n="4"

                                against 18 percent in the First Five Year Plan. In absolute terms,
                                the plan provides that military expenditures will remain
                                approximately at 1956 levels. Not only does military spending reduce
                                the funds available for other purposes, but it also competes for
                                commodities in short supply such as steel and trucks, and takes a
                                large share of the earnings from exports to finance military
                                imports.</item>

                                the Far East, we believe that the gross national product will
                                increase at an annual rate of six to seven percent during the period
                                1956–1962, as compared with an annual rate of increase of
                                approximately seven to eight percent during the period 1952–1957.
                                This increase will result in a total increase in <gloss

                                1958–1962 as compared with the 45 percent envisaged in the proposal
                                for the Second Five Year Plan announced in September 1956.
                                Agricultural output will probably increase at an average annual rate
                                of about three percent rather than the planned rate of six percent.
                                Since the regime will have to compensate for the shortfall in
                                agriculture, the Chinese people, especially the peasants, will be
                                placed under heavy strain. However, it is not likely that the regime
                                during the five year period will push the investment program to the
                                extent that no increase in per capita consumption is possible,
                                although they may do so for short periods to make up for temporary

                                maintaining and developing its armed forces as a basic aspect of
                                national power. With Soviet assistance, it has become by far the
                                strongest Asian military power. The ground forces of the People’s
                                Liberation Army total 2,500,000, many of whom are battle tested and
                                most of whom are fairly well trained. The air arm, including naval
                                aviation, is estimated to have 395 jet light bombers and 1,475 jet
                                fighters. The naval forces include four destroyers and 13
                                submarines, with additional units under construction, and an
                                estimated 315 aircraft. Of the latter, 160 are jet light bombers and
                                30 are jet fighters.</item>

                            <item>The position of the Chinese Communists in the Communist world has
                                been greatly enhanced as a result of developments since the death of
                                Stalin and particularly because of the prominent role they have
                                played in Bloc affairs in the past year. Communist China’s initial
                                reaction to Soviet criticism of Stalin was one of aloofness and
                                noninvolvement, with Peiping taking care to point out Stalin’s
                                “strong points” as well as his “weaknesses.” However, as a result of
                                the Polish and Hungarian crises, Peiping has become increasingly
                                involved in Eastern European affairs. It has asserted the necessity
                                for each Communist country to develop with due regard to its own
                                political and social backgrounds, has pointed out that no one
                                Communist country is entitled to adopt an attitude of superiority
                                over other Communist countries, and probably has favored a more
                                flexible approach in Soviet relations with the Satellites. Communist
                                China has so far not joined in Soviet criticism of the Polish press
                                and there is some evidence of Sino-Soviet differences on Poland. On
                                the other hand, it supported the Soviet use of force in Hungary and
                                has insisted that the first duty of all Communist countries is
                                loyalty to international proletarian solidarity under the leadership
                                of the Soviet Union.</item>

                            <item>The tone of authority in the Chinese Communist statements and the
                                need apparently felt by the Kremlin for Chinese support on Eastern
                                European issues have made a deep impression on the Communist world,
                                and have further weakened the concept that Moscow is the only
                                authoritative interpreter of Communist ideological guidance. The
                                actions of the Chinese Communists would appear to suggest an
                                awareness of the need for some concessions to nationalism in the
                                interests of Bloc solidarity.</item>

                            <item>The Chinese Communists, in many cases, are the channel through

                                these parties probably look to the Soviet Union for leadership. The
                                Chinese Communists exercise substantial influence in North Vietnan
                                and North Korea. Communist China has extended a credit of $320
                                million to each of these countries, continues to maintain large
                                forces in North Korea, and is the principal supplier of military
                                assistance for North Vietnam. Communist China is developing
                                influence in Outer Mongolia, which until recently was an exclusive

                                industrial facilities, and supplied a large number of

                                increase its influence within the Communist Bloc and have an <pb

                                affecting the Bloc as a whole. However, Communist China will
                                continue to rely on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                                the Communist Bloc as the chief source of the imports, aid, and

                                programs. In addition, Peiping will almost certainly continue to
                                rely on Soviet military guarantees as its chief insurance against
                                what it regards as the danger of US attack. Although it is probable
                                that some conflicts of interest and disagreements will develop
                                between Moscow and Peiping, it is highly unlikely that either will
                                permit such conflicts to impair Sino-Soviet solidarity.</item>

                                the first half of 1956. Other examples have been the rice-for-rubber
                                deal with Ceylon, the Sino-Burma trade agreement, and the
                                suggestions to Japan that large amounts of coal and iron ore would

                                influence. The Sino-Cambodia aid agreement, which was signed in June

                                aid. Under an agreement signed in October 1956, Nepal is to receive

                                Chinese Communist foreign policy, designed to convince non-Communist

                                subversive activities in Southeast Asia. Moreover, the buildup of
                                Chinese Communist military capabilities and occasional border
                                incursions constitute a continuing pressure on neighboring

                                especially those of Southeast Asia. It is attempting to obtain
                                control of local Chinese schools, newspapers, organizations, and
                                leaders, and is conducting a large scale propaganda campaign to
                                revive interest in Chinese culture. In mainland China, preferential
                                treatment has been promised to Overseas Chinese students and to
                                relatives of Overseas Chinese. Although these efforts have resulted
                                in some increase in Communist China’s influence among Overseas
                                Chinese, the bulk of the latter still appear to be intent on
                                improving their positions in their resident countries, and seek to
                                avoid involvement in the struggle for their allegiance.</item>

                                Communist groups in Asia. This policy has been followed even in the
                                neutralist countries despite its adverse effects on Chinese
                                Communist relations with the governments concerned. In Burma, the
                                government is concerned over the assistance given by the Chinese
                                Communist Embassy to the local Communists. Many Indonesians,

                                the ties between the Indonesian Communist Party and Peiping. The
                                Indian government is concerned by the probability that the Chinese
                                Communists are giving assistance to the Communists in Nepal and the
                                possibility that the Naga tribes have received arms from Communist

                                exclusively of the intention to “liberate” Taiwan by “peaceful”
                                means. Peiping has adopted a “moderate” attitude toward the
                                Nationalists, offering potential defectors positions in the Peiping
                                regime corresponding to those of ex-Nationalist collaborators in
                                Communist China. Peiping propaganda directed toward Taiwan attempts
                                to create the impression that the US is an unreliable ally for the
                                National government and that the latter will inevitably collapse.
                                Despite Peiping’s seemingly conciliatory attitude toward Taiwan, the
                                Chinese Communists continue to reject categorically any suggestions
                                for a compromise solution to the Taiwan problem involving “two
                                Chinas”; they equally reject suggestions for a meaningful

                            <item>The attitude of Communist China toward the US continues to be one
                                of hostility and mistrust and its policy is directed toward
                                destroying the US position in the Far East. Peiping portrays the US
                                as the chief threat to peace in Asia and the world and the source of
                                most of the problems facing the countries of Asia. Nevertheless, the
                                Chinese Communists have made some gestures to create the impression
                                that current Communist “peace” tactics apply also to relations with
                                the US. These gestures, however, appear to de directed not at
                                improving relations with the US, but at undermining US policies and
                                creating a belief, particularly in Asia, that a shift in the US
                                attitude toward the Chinese Communists is imminent.</item>

                                permanent, and perhaps not unfriendly world power, which will exert
                                a major influence on the course of events in Asia. Many Asians are
                                impressed by the effective control which the Chinese Communists

                                anticolonialist propaganda and do not believe that the Chinese

                                receptivity to this propaganda is encouraged by the tendency in Asia
                                to equate capitalism and private enterprise with colonialism. There

                                of Western intentions, there is also an undercurrent of apprehension
                                regarding Communist China’s real intentions. This apprehension has
                                been caused by Communist China’s role in international Communism,
                                particularly its connections with the support of indigenous
                                Communist movements in individual Asian countries, and by mistrust
                                in many Asian countries of historical Chinese expansionism.
                                Peiping’s efforts to exploit the Overseas Chinese communities in
                                most Southeast Asian countries have also created fears of its

                                military power, and that they are dependent upon the US for defense
                                against a possible Communist attack. Because of their dislike of
                                such dependence and their concern as to the effectiveness of US
                                action in their defense, many prominent Asians, especially in South
                                and Southeast countries, have come to believe that they should show
                                discretion in some form of neutralism or at least a willingness to
                                be friendly and to reciprocate Chinese Communist overtures, and
                                finally, that if a trend toward Communist success should develop,
                                they should not be the last to attempt some form of political
                                accommodation. Many Asian leaders seem to have confidence that, even
                                though they increase their political and economic contacts with
                                Communist China, they will be able to resist attempts to encroach
                                upon their political independence. These factors exist to some
                                extent even in many of the countries aligned with the US. At the
                                same time, even in non-aligned neutralist countries there is a
                                widespread, though seldom publicly voiced, recognition of the
                                importance of the US in restraining Communist China from overt

                                anticolonialist, and nationalist sentiments in Asia and will
                                continue its efforts to discredit US actions and motives and to seek
                                a reduction in Western influence and military power in Asia. It will
                                encourage wherever possible the formation of governments in which
                                the Communist influence could be expanded. Communist China will
                                almost certainly increase its official and unofficial contacts with
                                the governments and people in non-Communist Asia, and will probably
                                continue to increase trade with non-Communist countries, especially
                                with Japan and other Asian countries. Peiping will also probably

                                Peiping will continue its attempts to acquire influence over, and

                                China will continue its subversive efforts, will probably apply
                                pressure on a selective basis to remind the Asians of its power, and
                                will take advantage of opportunities for Communist expansion,
                                possibly including the extension of support to armed revolts against
                                non-Communist governments. During the period of this estimate,
                                Peiping will probably try to avoid courses of action which it
                                believes would provoke US military intervention. However, the
                                possibility cannot be excluded that the Chinese Communists will step
                                up military action against the offshore islands, or will attempt to
                                seize one of the smaller islands, to test US intentions and to
                                increase external pressure on the US to bring about a Nationalist
                                evacuation of these islands. If the Chinese Communists became
                                convinced that the US would not assist in the defense of these
                                islands with its own forces, they probably would attempt to seize
                                them. Should the Communist regimes in North Vietnam or North Korea
                                be subject to external attack the Chinese Communists would almost
                                certainly give material support to the Communist regimes in these
                                countries and would if necessary commit “volunteer” units to avoid a
                                defeat. However, the Chinese Communists would probably seek to limit
                                the area of conflict and to obtain a cease fire.</item>

                                almost certainly continue to be centered on neutralizing sources of
                                US support, isolating the US from its allies, and, ultimately,
                                destroying the US position in Asia. However, in its “peace”
                                strategy, Peiping may make conciliatory gestures relating to
                                peripheral questions in an effort to create the impression of
                                reasonableness. Peiping will almost certainly continue to press for

                            <item><hi rend="italic">Taiwan</hi>. Peiping remains determined to
                                obtain control of Taiwan. However, the Peiping regime apparently
                                recognizes that its military forces will not be able to seize Taiwan
                                against US military opposition. In consequence, Peiping is
                                attempting to reduce morale on Taiwan, in the hope that Nationalist
                                leaders may ultimately be induced to negotiate with Peiping over
                                Taiwan’s assimilation into Communist China. A major objective in any
                                conference with the US would be to induce the removal of US military
                                protection from Taiwan. The Chinese Communists will continue to
                                improve their military capabilities in the area opposite Taiwan and
                                the offshore islands, but they will almost certainly not attempt to
                                seize Taiwan by force so long as the US is committed to its defense.

                                they will almost certainly maintain adequate forces in Manchuria to
                                permit immediate reintervention. The Communists will almost
                                certainly refuse any settlement in Korea which endangers Communist
                                control of North Korea.</item>

                                prevent its re-emergence as a major military and political power in
                                Asia. It will attempt to weaken Japan’s links with the US by
                                exploiting US-Japanese policy differences. The Chinese Communists
                                will seek to increase the tolerance for Communism among the
                                Socialists and other groups. They will probably also offer trade
                                inducements, seeking both to increase Sino-Japanese trade and to
                                induce Japan to break the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"

                                Japan, anticipating the establishment of formal diplomatic
                                relations. These policies will contribute to the weakening of
                                Japan’s willingness to support US policy toward Communist

                                extend Communist control to South Vietnam and will probably act in
                                concert with Hanoi to expand Communist influence in Cambodia and
                                Laos. Through pressure, subversion, and overt propaganda the two
                                Communist regimes will attempt to discredit and undermine the
                                authority of the Diem government. The Chinese Communists probably
                                will not encourage North Vietnam to initiate open hostilities
                                against Diem, but might encourage Hanoi to initiate guerrilla
                                activities. In the event <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0537"/>a

                                a conciliatory approach in order to encourage a neutralist
                                development. Toward Cambodia and Laos, the Chinese Communists will
                                continue their gestures of friendship and goodwill and will probably
                                not engage in overt hostile propaganda, at least so long as the
                                authorities in these two governments reciprocate. Communist China
                                will probably expand its relations with both countries and formal
                                diplomatic relations are likely to be established.</item>

                                will continue to give covert support to the Indonesian

                                organization. Following the achievement of independence in Malaya
                                (expected in August 1957) and self-government in Singapore, Peiping
                                will seek to obtain recognition by these governments and will try to
                                promote greater Chinese political influence in relation to the Malay

                                continue, at least for the next few years, to strengthen friendly
                                relations with India and to encourage India’s efforts to bolster a
                                neutralist sentiment throughout Asia and the Middle East. But this
                                general approach will probably not cause the Chinese Communists to
                                cease their efforts to increase their influence in the Indo-Tibetan

                                willing to agree to a settlement of the boundary dispute on terms
                                that appear conciliatory but is unlikely to cease its subversive

                                committed to the ultimate incorporation of Hong Kong and Macao in
                                its territory although this has not been stated as explicitly as in
                                the case of Taiwan. However, for the period of this estimate the
                                Chinese Communists will probably not attempt to seize these colonies
                                by force. Non-Communist Hong Kong and Macao have a certain utility
                                to Peiping as points of contact with the West; furthermore, Peiping
                                probably believes that an attack on Hong Kong at least would involve
                                hostilities with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and possibly
                                with the US as well. Nevertheless, during the period of this

                                arise over Hong Kong and Macao. Peiping will almost certainly

                                “peaceful penetration” to increase its political and economic
                                influence in Hong Kong and Macao, to reduce the effectiveness of
                                these areas as Western listening posts, and to undermine the resolve

                            has every intention at this time to honor its commitments to the U.S.
                            but expresses the opinion there are certain factors which might alter
                            the situation.</p>

                        <p>The leaders of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> are getting old
                            and may feel that time is running out. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> is in his seventieth year, and he
                            aspires to a “place in history” which he cannot achieve except through
                            return to the mainland. A further problem is the changing composition of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> army. Taiwanese recruits compose
                            almost 30% of the army, and some <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            officials believe the attempt to return must be made before the 30%
                            figure is reached. Thus, there are strong pressures on the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> at high levels for doing something
                            soon.</p>

                        <p>International factors which might impel the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> to take a calculated risk or to make a desperate attack
                            would be: admission of Peiping to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>;
                            rapprochement between Japan and Peiping; an incident in Korea which
                            would stimulate <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> action; a real or
                            feared shift in U.S. policy such as talks with Peiping at the highest
                            levels; evidence of conditions on the mainland which might encourage an
                            attempt to crack the bamboo curtain from outside.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Military factors</hi></p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> military forces will soon reach
                            the point of maximum efficiency with present equipment. After that point
                            is reached and passed, the Chinese Communists will tend to grow
                            proportionately stronger in comparison. Their military build-up opposite
                            Taiwan will not only make invasion of the mainland more difficult but
                            will also pose an increasingly serious threat to the security of Taiwan.
                            Thus, although by U.S. standards the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            armed forces do not have sufficient power successfully to invade the
                            mainland, they are better <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0540"

                            considerations, as well as the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> hope
                            that there would be support from mainland dissidents, the Chinese might
                            make an invasion attempt.</p>

                                    <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> military action</hi></p>
                        <p>The Embassy lists six situations which might stimulate or involve <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> military action: (1) an attack on
                            Taiwan or Penghu; (2) an attack on Kinmen or Matsu; (3) outbreak of
                            hostilities in Korea or Vietnam; (4) revolt on the mainland which would
                            invite intervention; (5) <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> bombing of
                            mainland airfields in self-defense or retaliation; (6) a deliberate
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> “desperation” assault on the
                            mainland.</p>
                        <p>With respect to (1), our policy is clearly defined, and although not
                            mentioned by the Embassy, we have carefully warned the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> against provocative or unjustifiable
                            action under (5). The Embassy suggests we might wish to re-examine or
                            formulate policy with respect to courses (2), (3), (4), and (6). In the
                            event of revolt on the mainland, for example, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> might consult with us regarding action
                            in support of the rebellion. Should we oppose such action, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could attack independently, make peace
                            with Peiping, or abandon hope of return to the mainland. The last can be
                            all but excluded; unlikely though it is that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> could come to terms with Peiping, it is more probable
                            than the abandonment of return hopes. The most likely <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> course would be to attack
                            independently. The Embassy states that in the event of a mainland revolt
                            the factors which prevented our effective intervention in Hungary are
                            generally lacking, and notes that failure to act in the Far East would
                            have the most serious consequences for the position of the US and the
                            free world.</p>

                        <p>One significant conclusion which can be drawn from this despatch is that
                            very grave risks would attend any attempt to impose a “two-Chinas”
                            solution on the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, or in any other way
                            to make the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> accept an indefinite
                            future on Taiwan. According to the judgments expressed in this despatch,
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could be expected to launch an
                            independent attack on the mainland, or even make its peace with Peiping,
                            in preference to abandonment of its hopes of return to the mainland.</p>

                            which essentially set forth the idea of a procedure whereby “the

                                    be beneficial to us.</item>

                                    limiting would be quite difficult and that further difficult

                                    appear that the Department was deciding arbitrarily who would

                        <p>To estimate the likelihood of military action by the Chinese Nationalists
                            against the mainland in the next year or so.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>1. We believe that the Chinese Nationalists are very unlikely to launch
                            an invasion or, in the absence of Chinese Communist provocation, to
                            initiate other major military action against the mainland in the next
                            year or so. There may be some increase in small scale raiding
                            operations, to prevent stabilization of the situation in the Taiwan
                            Strait and to improve intelligence. Moreover, although we believe it to
                            be unlikely, the possibility cannot be excluded that the Nationalists
                            might attempt within the period of this estimate to embroil the US in
                            major hostilities against the Chinese Communists by a “one-shot”
                            military operation, short of invasion, but of a scale or nature
                            calculated to cause substantial Chinese Communist retaliation. (<hi

                        <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                        <p>2. The Government of the Republic of China (<gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss>) has consistently maintained, since its withdrawal to
                            Taiwan in 1949, that its primary objective is to regain control on the
                            mainland and to eliminate the Chinese Communist regime. Military and
                            political action <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0544"/>and planning
                            on Taiwan continue to reflect the primary concern of top Nationalist
                            leaders with preparations for eventual return. Although there probably
                            are a number of Nationalist officials who have little hope of a return
                            to the mainland in the foreseeable future, the top leadership not only
                            maintain this hope, but appear to believe that both their claim to be
                            the government of China and their prospects for recovering the mainland
                            will diminish with prolonged confinement to Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>3. There has been in recent months a new flurry of statements by top
                            Nationalist leaders on the subject of return to the mainland,
                            emphasizing the combat readiness of their armed forces. Although these
                            statements have been more numerous and somewhat more definite in tone
                            than in recent years, they probably have been inspired in part by a
                            desire to refute Chinese Communist propaganda alleging “negotiations”
                            with Nationalist leaders on the future of Taiwan. In addition,
                            Nationalist leaders have indicated renewed interest in determining US
                            views on joint military action and have also shown greater awareness of
                            the need for determining the degree and extent of dissatisfaction on the
                            mainland. The Chinese Nationalist armed forces have made plans for large
                            scale operations, but such planning does not appear to go beyond normal
                            staff activity, and there are no indications at this time of any actual
                            preparations for large scale attack.</p>
                        <p>4. The following factors exist which might tempt the Nationalists to take
                            action against the mainland over the next year ox so: <list>
                                <label>a.</label>
                                <item>The Nationalist leaders probably estimate that the rate of
                                    improvement in their armed forces will level off as the <gloss

                                    Combat units presently have most of their weapons, and major
                                    shortages exist only in logistical support equipment.
                                    Furthermore, in the Nationalist view, the gradual influx of
                                    Taiwanese into the armed forces could over a period of time
                                    substantially reduce Nationalist capabilities against the
                                    mainland. Finally, the Nationalists probably estimate that the
                                    effectiveness of the Chinese Communist forces is increasing at a
                                    rapid rate as they acquire better weapons, improve their
                                    logistic capabilities, and increase their air and naval
                                    strength, and that the relative strength of the Nationalist
                                    forces is progressively declining.<note n="3" xml:id="d248fn3"

                                <item>The Nationalists probably also estimate that there is
                                    widespread dissatisfaction with Communist rule among the Chinese
                                    people on the mainland, which has been intensified by the recent
                                    socialization drive and to some extent by developments in

                                <item>Finally, the Nationalist leaders are concerned that increased

                                    United Nations, and may cause the US to support a stabilization
                                    of the situation on a “two Chinas” basis.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>5. We estimate that by exercising their maximum capability and with an
                            element of surprise the Chinese Nationalists could establish a beachhead
                            on the China mainland, but without US assistance they could hold it for
                            only a short time against determined Communist counteraction. We believe
                            that the top Nationalist leaders probably make the same military
                            estimate. We believe that under these circumstances they will not
                            attempt an invasion unless they are sure that it will either (a) be
                            accompanied by a large scale uprising of the Chinese people, including
                            substantial defections from the Chinese Communist armed forces, or (b)
                            have the active assistance and support of the US.</p>
                        <p>6. The Chinese Nationalists are not likely, within the next year or so,
                            to consider either of these conditions satisfied. They are aware that
                            dissatisfaction on the mainland is not organized and directed, and they
                            probably estimate that an invasion attempt, during the period of this
                            estimate, would not trigger mass uprisings and defections on a scale
                            sufficient to be of significant assistance to them. Moreover, the
                            Chinese Nationalists have almost certainly concluded that the US will
                            not agree to a joint military operation against the mainland, at least
                            under present conditions. We believe, therefore, that they are unlikely
                            to make a formal request of the US for such a joint operation, or to
                            take unilateral action in the hope or expectation of receiving direct US
                            military support. Under the terms of the exchange of notes pursuant to
                            the Mutual Defense Treaty of December 1954 the Government of the
                            Republic of China is committed to “joint agreement” with the US with
                            regard to the “use of force” from territory under its control except for
                            “action of an emergency character which is clearly an exercise of the
                            inherent right of self-defense.” Nationalist leaders almost certainly
                            believe that their best chance of eliciting US support would lie in
                            making the hostilities appear to be Chinese Communist-initiated, and
                            they are fully aware that preparations for a major assault could not be
                            concealed from American eyes. Recently President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> again assured the US Ambassador
                            in Taipei that his government would not attempt a return to the mainland
                            without prior consultation with the US. The top Nationalist leaders,
                            however, probably believe that any Chinese Communist threatening move,
                            such as a movement of combat aircraft to the nearby coastal air fields,
                            would justify counteraction within their emergency right of
                            self-defense.</p>
                        <p>7. The possibility cannot be excluded that the Chinese Nationalists might
                            attempt to invade the mainland as a matter of desperation, <pb n="518"
                                xml:id="pg_518" facs="0546"/>if they felt that their position was
                            deteriorating so greatly as to threaten their existence. However, we
                            foresee no events likely to have this result within the period of this
                            estimate; for example, even Japanese recognition of Communist China or
                            the seating of Communist China in the UNGA, should either occur, would
                            probably not drive the Chinese Nationalists to the point of desperation,
                            provided the US continued to give firm support to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>8. Accordingly, we conclude that the Chinese Nationalists are very
                            unlikely to launch an invasion, or, in the absence of Chinese Communist
                            provocation, to initiate other major military action against the
                            mainland in the next year or so. The chances of major Nationalist action
                            would be increased if the Chinese Communists were to become involved in
                            hostilities in Korea (with or without collusion between the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>) or in Vietnam. However, we believe that, unless such
                            hostilities were accompanied by widespread uprisings on mainland China
                            or the Chinese Nationalists were convinced that the US would support and
                            assist them, the Nationalists probably would not even then undertake
                            major action.</p>
                        <p>9. The Chinese Nationalists nevertheless possess the capability, and have
                            indicated an intention, to increase the number of small raids and
                            probing actions against the mainland. Such actions could be planned and
                            launched without prior knowledge of American observers. Motivation for
                            increasing such operations would be to prevent stabilization of the
                            situation in the Taiwan Strait and to improve intelligence relating to
                            the coastal areas of the mainland. We believe that over the next year,
                            assuming the present degree of US controls, there may be some increase
                            in small scale raiding operations for these purposes.</p>
                        <p>10. The Chinese Nationalists still believe that their best chance for a
                            successful return to the mainland (short of an internal collapse of the
                            Chinese Communist regime) lies in a war between the US and Communist
                            China. We do not believe the Nationalists would consider that small
                            scale operations would cause the Chinese Communists to hit back in such
                            force as to invoke the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>–US Defense
                            Treaty, nor do we believe that the Nationalists would conduct any series
                            of larger operations in the face of US disapproval. Although we believe
                            it an unlikely course of action, the possibility cannot be excluded that
                            the Nationalists might attempt within the period of this estimate to
                            embroil the US in major hostilities against the Chinese Communists by a
                            “one-shot” military operation, short of invasion, but of a scale or
                            nature calculated to cause substantial Chinese Communist
                            retaliation.</p>

                                >Rankin</persName> develops the thesis that we should attempt to
                            supply the “missing ingredient” in our China policy—grounds for <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> confidence in the future.</p>
                        <p>Noting that we have accomplished much through military and economic
                            support, the Ambassador states that nevertheless the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> leaders may doubt that time is on their
                            side. In their minds, they see the possibility of: (1) a change in U.S.
                            policy with a consequent shifting of responsibility for Taiwan to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> which would undermine the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and make a Communist take-over
                            inevitable; (2) expanding US contacts with Peiping eventually leading to
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> disintegration; (3) a deal
                            between Tokyo and Peiping which the US could not prevent; (4) a war of
                            attrition in the offshore-island area not of sufficient intensity to
                            stimulate US intervention but ending with Communist air and sea control
                            in the area; (5) full-scale war involving the US elsewhere and thereby
                            exposing Taiwan to Communist conquest before effective US assistance
                            could be sent; (6) large-scale nuclear war in Asia with Taiwan and
                            Okinawa as priority targets. The only two possibilities offering the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> hope are: (1) internal collapse
                            on the mainland, permitting a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> return
                            or (2) aggression by Peiping in Asia which would secure US support for a
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> military return to the mainland.
                            Unfortunately for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> morale and
                            confidence, the disastrous possibilities are more numerous and seem more
                            likely to happen.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> lacks
                            confidence in the future and finds itself a “pawn” of external events.
                            Although not desperate now, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            could become desperate, and it is in the US interest to prevent

                                    abridging the freedom of the press and using the press as an
                                    instrument in its diplomacy. I agree that other principles are
                                    involved, but in the long view this one seems to me to be

                            convinced that our Far Eastern policies, of vital importance to the
                            United States, would be gravely impaired if there were a general influx
                            of Americans into Communist China at this time. There are many reasons
                            for this, so many that when we sometimes refer to one reason and
                            sometimes to another we are charged with being “inconsistent”. I could
                            list here, if time permitted, twenty reasons which are cumulative such
                            as the non-recognition of the regime, so that we cannot issue a
                            “passport” to it; the existence of a quasi-state of war and the
                            continued application of the Trading with the Enemy Act; the illegal
                            jailing of Americans already in China despite promises to let them out;
                            the effect upon free countries of Asia of what the <gloss

                            have soberly and definitely come to the conclusion I expressed.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed this problem informally with a number of leaders in the
                            newspaper field. One of them made the suggestion that the newsgathering
                            fraternity might agree to some “pooling” arrangement as has sometimes
                            been the case in the past. I felt that, if so, we might be able to
                            accept that without the unacceptable consequences to which I allude. I
                            emphasize the idea was not one that I originated or initiated; it was an
                            idea brought to me by a responsible leader in the newspaper field. I am
                            inclined to think that he and others who have examined this proposal now
                            feel that it would be impractical to agree to bring about an acceptable
                            limitation. But what concerns me is that the reasoning which leads
                            responsible members of the newsgathering fraternity to conclude that
                            they cannot draw lines as between themselves points up the difficulty of
                            the Department’s drawing lines as between “responsible” newsgatherers
                            and what you call “frivolous journalistic adventurers”. Also I see no
                            valid distinction between newsgatherers and those members of other
                            professions who claim a constitutional right to travel, once travel for
                            a profession as a whole is allowed.</p>
                        <p>It did seem to me that since, as you say, it would be “necessary to guard
                            against frivolous journalistic adventures by people more interested in
                            visiting China than reporting what is going on there”, and since the
                            Department itself cannot well establish that guard and make the
                            differentiations that would obviously be called for, the newspaper
                            fraternity might do that themselves. Then they might arrive at a result
                            which the Department could accept.</p>
                        <p>You suggest that our policy with respect to Americans going to China
                            “abridges the freedom of the press”. The constitutional “freedom of the
                            press” relates to <hi rend="italic">publication</hi>, and not to the
                            gathering of news. There are, of course, many occasions and many areas
                            where, for security or policy reasons, newspaper correspondents are
                            excluded. Also you suggest that we are “using the press as an instrument
                            of our diplomacy”. But United States foreign policy inevitably involves
                            the acceptance of certain restraints by the American people. If it were
                            not so, foreign policy would be impotent. When young men are drafted and
                            sent abroad, they are used as instruments of foreign policy. When
                            business people are not allowed to trade with Communist China, they
                            might equally argue that they are being used as instruments of our
                            diplomacy. Foreign policy and diplomacy cannot succeed unless, in fact,
                            it channels the activities of our people, and in this respect
                            newspapermen have also their loyalty and patriotic duty.</p>

                            left a young wife and an infant daughter. The United States military
                            authorities issued a press release on March 21, stating the Chinese and
                            United States authorities were investigating the case and would make a
                            report.</p>
                        <p>The incident was picked up in the local English and vernacular press and
                            led to much speculation. The general tone of the press was unfavorable
                            to <persName>Reynolds</persName>; there were allegations that the
                            killing was a deliberate grudge affair and that the deceased and
                                <persName>Reynolds</persName> had engaged together in black-market
                            operations. At that time the Embassy reported that “some difficulty” was
                            expected over the fact that two shots were fired, the second occurring
                            after <persName>Reynolds</persName> had followed the deceased some
                            distance from his residence. The Embassy also reported that the Chinese
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs had expressed concern over the case and
                            appeared to expect that <persName>Reynolds</persName> would be court
                            martialed. The case was also picked up in Chinese Communist
                            propaganda.</p>
                        <p>Press comment continued generally unfavorable to
                                <persName>Reynolds</persName> but ceased at the end of March,
                            perhaps on instruction from official quarters. In the meantime,
                            investigations were carried out by our military officials and by the
                            Chinese officials. Under the terms of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> Agreement, <persName>Reynolds</persName> enjoyed
                            immunity from Chinese jurisdiction, and the case was to be handled by
                            Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, under the procedures of
                            the United States Military Code.</p>
                        <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0553"/>
                        <p>On April 9, the Chinese Procurator’s Office announced that its
                            investigation had been completed and the results would be forwarded to
                            the Embassy through the Foreign Ministry. The Embassy reported that this
                            caused additional press interest mainly devoted to speculation as to how
                            the United States military authorities would dispose of the case.</p>
                        <p>On April 16, the Embassy received the Procurator’s report and the
                            physical evidence. The report held that the killing “was done with
                            malice and not in self-defense”, a conclusion which the Embassy
                            described as “unwarranted and gratuitous”. The Embassy noted in this
                            connection that some circumstances surrounding the shooting might
                            require further explanation and that the United States investigation was
                            to be completed on April 22.</p>
                        <p>Formal charges were preferred against <persName>Reynolds</persName> some
                            time late in April and on May 7, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            announced that the Chief, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, had
                            approved the pre-trial investigator’s recommendation that Sergeant
                                <persName>Reynolds</persName> be tried by General Court Martial to
                            “establish his guilt or innocence on the charge of unlawful and willful
                            killing of a prowler in the vicinity of his home”. The Embassy indicated
                            that information from <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> suggested
                                <persName>Reynolds</persName> would be tried on charges of voluntary
                            manslaughter, and said the trial would convene on May 15, if the defense
                            was ready, or on May 20.</p>
                        <p><persName>Reynolds</persName> was acquitted on May 23. This decision was
                            received with great dissatisfaction by the Chinese, the vernacular press
                            made inflammatory statements, and anti-American feeling and
                            demonstrations built up, culminating in an attack against the American
                            Embassy around noon on May 24. Demonstrators entered the Embassy,
                            smashed furniture, wrecked the building, transportation and
                            communications. As a result messages from Taiwan are now being received
                            through Taiwan Defense Command facilities. The <gloss target="#t_USIS1"
                                >USIS</gloss> office is also reported to have been wrecked. It is
                            variously reported that from five to nine Americans, including Embassy
                            personnel, have been injured, one seriously. (Press reports state this
                            was Alexander Boase, press officer.<note n="3" xml:id="d252fn3">Of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>.</note> We have no
                            official reports yet identifying the injured.) Since the police were not
                            able to handle the demonstrators, the Ministry of National Defense
                            called in troops and the last message from the Commander, Taiwan Defense
                            Command, sent at 5:45 p.m., local time, expressed the opinion that the
                            situation was improving. Taiwan Defense Command was being protected by
                            Chinese troops.</p>
                        <p>Of incidental interest was the Taiwan Defense Command comment that Bob
                            Brown of the United Press “had done his share to stir things up”. There
                            was no further explanation.</p>

                        <p>The President said actually this is not a case that should be turned over
                            to Japan. It was only under protest that Defense instructed their people
                            to turn him over.</p>
                        <p>Secy. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said no—that there is
                            a provision in the administrative agreement which says that if they
                            cannot agree, and if each side claims jurisdiction, then at the request
                            of the other, one will consider waiving jurisdiction in favor of the
                            other.</p>
                        <p>The President said American forces will not let one of their people be
                            tried in foreign court if they can help it. (We are up against the same
                            thing here at home, too.) The rule has to do with people not on duty,
                            but on leave or away from situation—same as other tourists. But
                            regardless of the wording of the treaty, we are in trouble here.</p>

                        <p>Secy. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> feels that he and
                            Defense should talk it over with the President. The situation is
                            serious. These developments in Taipei are going to have a chain reaction
                            also in Japan. The issues at stake are tremendous. The President is well
                            aware of this, and said he is now afraid of our status of forces in
                            Europe and everywhere else.</p>
                        <p>The President thinks our man in Taipei did not have much sense, chasing
                            someone for a long time, then finally shooting. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed, and said he does not
                            understand how he got acquitted. He thinks probably the story told to
                            the Congressmen was an inaccurate portrayal—the man was actually on
                            duty.</p>
                        <p>The President thinks we must have a very serious look at these Asiatic
                            countries, and decide whether we can stay there. It does not seem wise,
                            if they hate us so much.</p>

                            which had just occurred in Taipei. The Chinese Government deplored the
                            mob action which had resulted in damage to American Embassy property and
                            injuries to employees of the American Government.</p>
                        <p>He said that the Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs had telephoned

                            instructed to convey the regrets of the Chinese Government to the
                            Department at the earliest possible moment. He had been given the text
                            of the message he was to deliver by telephone. He said that he had had
                            the message typed for the Department’s <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529"

                        <p>The Ambassador said that he wanted to add his own personal assurances of
                            regret and sorrow at the occurrence. It was most unfortunate and he
                            deplored it very sincerely. He expressed the hope and belief that the
                            situation had now been brought under control.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said the American
                            Government was deeply disturbed and shocked at this destructive outbreak
                            of mob violence. No one could tell yet how far-reaching the consequences
                            would be but it was an exceedingly unfortunate business which was bound
                            to have harmful repercussions. It could not have come at a worse time.

                                >Robertson</persName> commented on the apparent negligence of the

                            threatening. He noted that Amb. <persName corresp="#p_RKL1"
                                >Rankin</persName> had already put on record the protest of the U.S.
                            Government at the failure of the Chinese Government to extend
                            protection, and that Amb. <persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName>
                            had reserved our right to full indemnification for losses sustained.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he was aware
                            that Amb. <persName corresp="#p_THK1">Tong</persName> deplored the
                            occurence and the unhappy consequences that could be anticipated, just
                            as we did.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the
                            Ambassador might encounter the press when he left the Department and
                            might want to be prepared with some sort of a statement.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_THK1">Tong</persName> said he would welcome an

                            his Government, along with assurances that steps were being taken to

                                    <persName>Reynolds</persName> Case and Mob Action at the
                                Embassy</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy had been confidentially informed on May 23, 1957 that on May
                            24, 1957 the Chinese Military would conduct three surprise air raid
                            exercises in which paratroops would be dropped and street traffic
                            stopped. To avoid the first exercise I arrived at the Embassy before
                            7:00 a.m.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after 9:00 a.m. the Chief of Protocol informed me that the
                            Foreign Minister wished to see me at 10:30 a.m. I told Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> that I would be in an important
                            meeting at <gloss target="#t_TDC1">TDC</gloss> at that time but that I
                            would come immediately or as soon after eleven o’clock as possible. He
                            called me back a few minutes later and requested that I come
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving the Embassy I called a four o’clock meeting of
                            representatives of several U.S. agencies to discuss the developments in
                            the <persName>Reynolds</persName> case and the U.S. Government’s
                            position.</p>
                        <p>Upon arrival the Minister stated that he wished to discuss the verdict in
                            the <persName>Reynolds</persName> case and the Chinese public resentment
                            towards it. He inquired whether and under what circumstance there could
                            be a retrial of the case. I replied that I had to plead ignorant of the
                            juridical procedures under our Unified Code of Justice but that I would
                            look into the matter and report to him later in the day.</p>
                        <p>I went directly from the Foreign Office to <gloss target="#t_TDC1"
                                >TDC</gloss> where I arrived at 10.00 a.m. for a joint conference
                            with Mr. <persName>Frank Nash</persName>, Consultant to the President,
                            and his group. I remained in this meeting until <pb n="532"
                                xml:id="pg_532" facs="0560"/>almost a quarter to one o’clock. Before
                            the meeting adjourned I was called to the phone a couple of times. Mr.
                                <persName>Meyer</persName>, the Political Counselor told me that
                            widow of the Chinese Sgt. <persName>Reynolds</persName> shot was outside
                            the Embassy gate, and crowds were beginning to gather.</p>
                        <p>I went to the Grand Hotel with a part of the Nash group for a brief lunch
                            and immediately upon arrival put in a call to the Foreign Minister, who
                            was out for lunch. Before I had finished lunch Mr.
                                <persName>Prescott</persName>, Second Secretary in the Political
                            Section, came to the hotel, and reported that the situation at the
                            Embassy was getting worse. I excused myself from lunch, and proceeded to
                            the Foreign Office, stopping for a few moments en route at my residence,
                            where two or three Embassy officers had gathered.</p>
                        <p>I arrived at the Foreign Office a little before or around 2:00 p.m. and
                            went directly to the Minister’s office where I requested to see the
                            Minister immediately. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HS1">Hsu
                                Shao-Chang</persName>, Director of the Department of American
                            Affairs, was called and invited me into the Foreign Minister’s private
                            office. I remained there for almost four hours.</p>
                        <p>I was told the Minister would be over immediately but before he arrived
                            Vice Minister <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> joined Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HS1">Hsu</persName> and me. I told them that I
                            demanded full and adequate protection to American lives and property in
                            Taipei. I told them the situation at the Embassy was getting out of hand
                            and overstepped the bounds of propriety by suggesting the use of fire
                            hoses and tear gas. I told them the police protection there was
                            inadequate.</p>
                        <p>The Minister arrived around two fifteen. There were no niceties. I rose
                            and stated this visit grieved me and that the U.S. Government demanded
                            immediate assistance at the Embassy. By that time Embassy officers had
                            learned I was at the Foreign Office and began to report to me, there in
                            the Minister’s office, the terrible developments. I pleaded that the
                            situation was desperate and that we had to have help immediately. The
                            Minister said he saw no way out but to call out the troops. This
                            decision was reached after a few minutes. I replied that we wanted
                            whatever was required to protect American lives and property.</p>
                        <p>The Minister began to put in phone calls. He called General <persName
                                corresp="#p_PM1">Peng</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d257fn2"

                                of the General Staff.</note> Admiral <persName>Ma</persName>,<note

                                Deputy Minister of the Ministry of National Defense.</note> and
                            others. Reports to me by phone were more frequent. In fact I supplied
                            the Foreign Office most of its intelligence information on the situation
                            at the Embassy for four hours. I told the Minister that the mob was in
                            the Embassy destroying it, and that some American officers and clerks
                            were trapped in the air-raid shelter and that I was afraid the building
                            would be set on fire and <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0561"/>the
                            shelter become a crematorium. I asked that fire trucks be sent. This was
                            checked by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HS1">Hsu</persName> who reported
                            they were already there. At this point I began to relay names of our
                            staff at the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that he had to go to the Legislature to a committee
                            hearing on the <persName>Reynolds</persName> case. He invited me to
                            remain until his return.</p>
                        <p>I remained in the Foreign Minister’s office with the Vice Minister and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HS1">Hsu</persName> both of whom came and
                            went. I received more reports on the Minister’s phones. Probably few
                            Chargés have usurped a Foreign Minister’s office for so long.</p>
                        <p>The Minister returned within about an hour. I reported to him that Sgt.
                                <persName>Reynolds</persName> and family had left Taiwan at 1:30
                            p.m. I gave him the names of the persons in the air-raid shelter and of
                            those for whom we could not account. The Minister made many telephone
                            calls and spoke the names in English I had given him. He sent Foreign
                            Office personnel to the scene and to the Taiwan Provincial Government
                            hospital from where one of our officers had phoned me. The officer was
                            with the group who escaped from the air-raid shelter. All could not be
                            accounted for.</p>
                        <p>My residence, and until 5 p.m., the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>
                            office were used as clearing houses for information and reports relayed
                            to me as received.</p>
                        <p>The Minister took a personal interest in accounting for individuals and
                            was particularly concerned about the Political Counselor. We then
                            learned of the attack on the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>
                            building.</p>
                        <p>By six o’clock we had accounted for all who were thought to have been in
                            the Embassy at the lunch hour. (Messrs. <persName>Bonner</persName> and
                                <persName>O’Grady</persName><note n="4" xml:id="d257fn4"
                                    ><persName>Henry S. Bonner</persName>, political officer, and
                                    <persName>Gerald D. O’Grady, Jr.</persName>, attaché.</note>
                            returned from lunch and were hidden by police in an Embassy garage. It
                            was some time later before they were accounted for.)</p>
                        <p>At various times during the four-hour period I discussed with the
                            Minister, the Vice Minister and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HS1"
                                >Hsu</persName> Chinese responsibility for this outrage. I told them
                            the hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars damage was insignificant to
                            the damage to US/<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relations and the
                            prestige to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the Free World. They
                            were obviously embarrassed and well aware of the consequences.</p>
                        <p>About six o’clock I expressed a desire to return to my residence. The
                            Minister said my car had been placed in the Foreign Office garage as
                            crowds were out in front. The Minister escorted me to the front door, my
                            car was brought, and a police escort was ready. He asked me to return to
                            the building. My car was put back in the garage. I was escorted out the
                            back door and was taken to my residence in a closed jeep.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after I arrived home, where I found several Embassy staff
                            members, the Ambassador called from the airport. I relayed <pb n="534"
                                xml:id="pg_534" facs="0562"/>briefly some of the developments. He
                            had already learned much from the U.S. Naval Attaché who was at the
                            airport to meet the new Naval Attaché. The Ambassador stated that he was
                            going directly to the Foreign Office. From that point on the situation
                            was in his hands.</p>

                        <p>Based on preliminary and as yet incomplete information, we have reached
                            the following tentative conclusions about the mob attack of May 24 on
                            the U.S. Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> in Taipei: <list>

                                <item>The riots showed evidences of prior planning. Although the
                                    crowds were large, the actual damage seems for the most part to
                                    have been done by small groups of rioters who acted as if in
                                    accordance with a pre-arranged plan. These had prepared
                                    themselves with slogans which were mounted on the Embassy
                                    premises. The entire incident began with the appearance of the
                                    widow of Liu Tzu-jan (wife of the man Sergeant
                                        <persName>Reynolds</persName> killed) in front of the
                                    Embassy with a placard written in both English and Chinese. Also
                                    in the attack on the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>
                                    building, the riot was led by a small group of students who
                                    apparently were responsible for most of the damage done. While
                                    the destruction was deliberate and premeditated, there is as of
                                    now no definite evidence of an intent to exploit it for
                                    intelligence purposes, although some of the classified documents
                                    from the safes which were broken open may have been picked up
                                    and retained by unauthorized persons.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>There are some indications that the law enforcement
                                    authorities were either grossly negligent and inefficient or
                                    acted in collusion with the rioters. Although there were many
                                    police in the neighborhood of the Embassy at the time the attack
                                    took place, they failed to take effective action to control the
                                    riot. The riot was allowed to run its course before being
                                    finally brought under control that evening by troops.
                                    Furthermore, while taking no effective action to protect
                                    American property, the police did seem most anxious that no
                                    serious bodily harm should be done the persons of Americans.
                                    Another indication <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0563"/>of
                                    collusion or gross inefficiency is the fact that although the
                                    Embassy appealed for greater police protection as soon as the
                                    situation seemed threatening, and although the Chargé spent most
                                    of the afternoon at the Foreign Ministry seeking protection for
                                    the Embassy, nothing effective was done by the Chinese
                                    authorities until that evening, many hours after the riots had
                                    taken a serious turn.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>It is too early as yet to hazard an opinion as to possible
                                    motives for staging such an incident. The Embassy in Taipei has
                                    been asked for a full report and evaluation.<note n="2"
                                        xml:id="d258fn2">See <ref target="#d259"><hi rend="italic"
                                                >infra</hi></ref>.</note> When that is received, it
                                    should be possible to make a judgment on this matter. However,
                                    of the various possibilities that suggest themselves, that of
                                    Communist inspiration seems the least likely. So far no
                                    suggestion has been made—even by Chinese sources—that the
                                    Communists may have been behind the affair.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Regardless of the eventual judgment, it is a shock to us that an
                            anti-American manifestation of such magnitude and violence should come
                            to pass in Taipei. It was not fore-shadowed in any report we have seen
                            from any of the numerous U.S. Government reporting agencies on
                            Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>It is disappointing that the Chinese Government met the challenge with
                            relative passivity, and that no public expression of regret has come
                            from a source higher than the Foreign Minister.</p>

                            paragraphs, but more immediate explanations must await further
                            investigation and establishment of facts. I am placing on Chinese
                            authorities <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0564"/>burden of proof
                            that there was adequate excuse for leaving Embassy in hands of unarmed
                            mob for period of several hours.</p>
                        <p>Anti-Americanism. As such, apparently remains relatively insignificant,
                            but as elsewhere in Asia there is always undercurrent of distrust and
                            dislike of Western influences. (Even hated Communism was importation
                            from Europe.) Whether directed at colonial powers or white race in
                            general, open manifestations usually are directed against Western group
                            most in evidence. Nearly 11,000 Americans are on Taiwan most of whom
                            ride about in new cars, enjoy various special privileges and living
                            standards which seem very high to Chinese. These Americans occupy
                            themselves with almost every phase of Chinese life on scale scarcely
                            less extensive than colonial powers in their colonies. (There are said
                            to be many more American civilian officials on Taiwan today, for
                            example, than in Philippines when it was US possession.) Working and
                            personal relationships have been surprisingly good, but latent
                            resentment at above circumstances doubtless responsible in part for
                            events of May 24.</p>
                        <p>Another anti-Western aspect is that present <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> Cabinet largely made up of Western-educated Chinese who
                            are ipso facto regarded with suspicion by many if not most of old
                            school. Premier, Foreign Minister and Economic Minister in particular
                            under fire recently, ostensibly for their support of US and other
                            foreign interests. <persName>Reynolds</persName> case offered
                            exceptional opportunity to discredit them and prepare way for cabinet
                            along more traditional lines, possibly including old time military
                            figures.</p>
                        <p>Frustration. Whether expressed in terms of morale, confidence or
                            otherwise, people of Free China are uncertain of their future and suffer
                            from “pawn complex” lest their eventual fate be decided by others,
                            perhaps behind their backs. Sense of frustration would explain in part
                            outbursts in which they demonstrate their independence, temporarily at
                            least, and their dissatisfaction with things as they are.</p>
                        <p>Status of Forces. Prolonged delay in concluding US–<gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Status of Forces agreement, together
                            with extensive press coverage of Girard case in Japan have contributed
                            to public awareness here that US forces in Free China at present enjoy
                            diplomatic immunity of unusual character. Particularly unfortunate but
                            unavoidable that <persName>Reynolds</persName> case, first such US court
                            martial in Taiwan, should have come up just now.</p>
                        <p>Nationalism. Victim of shooting, Liu, was connected official Institute of
                            Revolutionary Practice, albeit in minor capacity. Purpose this
                            institution is to develop national or “revolutionary” spirit which is
                            praiseworthy to a degree but can lead some people to excesses in crisis.
                            Fact that this institution receives no direct benefit from US aid
                            programs and presumably considers US policy toward China as woefully <pb
                                n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0565"/>inadequate could be expected to
                            reinforce resentment over present case. No reliable evidence produced as
                            yet but certain members this institution may have made preparations in
                            advance to exploit verdict of court martial. Some preliminary work
                            apparently done also among youth corps (again strongly nationalist)
                            students of middle schools who swelled numbers of mob at early stage.
                            When mob found police few in numbers and apparently instructed not to
                            fire, situation was exploited but seemingly with care that no Americans
                            too seriously injured. Perhaps promoters of demonstration did not
                            foresee its eventual scope; it simply got out of hand. Police reportedly
                            had instructions protect life (US and Chinese) rather than US
                            property.</p>

                            explanation for not using larger police force initially (apparently
                            never more than about 20 in Embassy compound during actual rioting), for
                            reported instructions that police must avoid use of arms, and for delay

                            troops.</p>
                        <p>Tentative conclusion is that taking advantage of differences in
                            US-Chinese legal conceptions, and in anticipation of not guilty verdict,
                            certain persons with some influence and connections prepared for
                            demonstration at Embassy. Situation developed in manner to encourage
                            exploitation, for which they had also prepared. To this extent it was

                            classified material or valuables was part of plan. After Embassy was
                            thoroughly wrecked, large part of mob went on to repeat process at

                        </list>
                        <p>Yesterday afternoon at five o’clock I called on President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>, by appointment, at his
                                <persName>Shih-lin</persName> Residence. Madame <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> and Vice Minister
                                <persName>Shen</persName> were present but took no part in the
                            conversation except to elaborate on two or three matters of translation.
                            The President’s English Secretary, <persName>Shen</persName>, acted as
                            interpreter, and the conversation lasted one hour.</p>
                        <p>After the usual exchange of courtesies and inquiries about health, the
                            President said that he felt great embarrassment and deep regret at last
                            Friday’s (May 24) events. He had been taken completely by surprise, and
                            he was sorry not to have been in Taipei to take action. (He and Madame
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> had just returned from
                            three weeks at Sun-Moon Lake.) President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName> stated that a full investigation was under way,
                            that I would receive a copy of the findings, and that the guilty persons
                            would be punished. He remarked that the authorities responsible for law
                            and order had been negligent, but added that the riot apparently was
                            spontaneous. He hoped that Chinese-American relations would continue as
                            friendly and close as before.</p>
                        <p>I replied that the Chinese had far better means of investigation than we,
                            but that reports coming to me indicated a combination of spontaneity and
                            planning. Initially the crowd at the Embassy seems to have been made up
                            largely of middle school students. They probably intended nothing more
                            than a peaceful demonstration. Subsequently older people, including a
                            number of apparent organizers, went among the crowd and incited them to
                            attack the Embassy. Reports reached me that NT$10 notes were distributed
                            to some of the crowd to encourage them to attack.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had been told that an American press correspondent
                            was in the crowd inciting them. I replied that I had heard the same
                            story and would appreciate any details which the Chinese could give me.
                            (This refers to <persName>Robert Brown</persName>, local United Press
                            representative).</p>
                        <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0567"/>
                        <p>I then gave President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> a
                            chronological review of Friday’s events as they had been reported to me,
                            covering substantially the same details given in the Embassy’s telegram
                            1190 of May 26.<note n="2" xml:id="d260fn2">See <ref target="#d252fn5"
                                    >footnote 5, Document 252</ref>.</note> I added that I must
                            leave it to the Chinese Government to explain why our Embassy had been
                            left in the hands of an unarmed mob for several hours despite the large
                            police and army resources available in the Taipei area. One possible
                            conclusion was that the organizers of the attack had sufficient
                            influence to prevent effective action by the police.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> assured me that
                            this last conclusion was unfounded. Rather, there had been a failure by
                            certain officials to accept responsibility for taking action. He added
                            that this was an old problem, going back to Mainland days, when there
                            was always hesitation in dealing with riots.</p>
                        <p>I replied that Americans had gained the impression that both police and
                            troops behaved well, but that they were restrained from taking timely
                            and effective action by orders from higher authority.</p>
                        <p>As to the <persName>Reynolds</persName> case, I told the President of the
                            extraordinary care which <persName corresp="#p_BGFSJ1">General
                                Bowen</persName> had exerted in arranging for the court martial. He
                            fully appreciated the significance of the case and obtained legal
                            assistance from Okinawa and Hawaii. Preparations were discussed with the
                            Chinese military, foreign affairs, judicial and public relations
                            authorities. The consensus of opinion was that an open court-martial
                            should be held here in Taipei with press representatives present. While
                            the trial was entirely in American military hands, and I was not
                            present, I had been assured that it was well and fairly conducted.
                            Moreover, I had read all of the results of the preliminary
                            investigations and had concluded privately that the court could not do
                            other than acquit <persName>Reynolds</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President complained that he had not been consulted in the matter.
                            Showing more agitation than at any other time during the interview, he
                            said that an American court martial should not be held on Chinese soil;
                            that it reminded everyone of extraterritoriality.</p>
                        <p>I replied that perhaps the President was right, but that no one else had
                            expressed such an opinion to me. I was glad to have his views for future
                            reference.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I urged that the President and his associates should give
                            their best thoughts to early steps calculated to remedy the bad
                            impression created by last Friday’s events. I did not presume to say
                            what these steps should be, but might mention certain actions which
                            would not be adequate: sacking the Chief of Police or transferring some
                            general.</p>
                        <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0568"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> asked me to convey
                            to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> his profound
                            regret and his assurance that the events of May 24 do not reflect
                            anti-Americanism in Free China, but simply resentment at the verdict of
                            a court martial. I said that I would do so, and asked if I might quote
                            this message at a press conference which I would hold an hour later. The
                            President agreed.<note n="3" xml:id="d260fn3">A summary of this

                            Washington over the weekend. He noted that the Chinese press in Taiwan
                            had called for the punishment of Sgt. <persName>Reynolds</persName> ever
                            since his acquittal, and had become increasingly inflammatory in tone.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that the
                            uprising in Taipei had been very carefully planned from the beginning,
                            and that the widow had had some official backing. The actions of the
                            government authorities to maintain order in the early stages, were not
                            very clear and cetainly not very active. There were very few police at
                            any time in the grounds of the American Embassy, and thus little
                            protection until 7:00 p.m., when Chinese Nationalist troops began to
                            move in. Some U. S. classified material has been compromised, although
                            the safe containing Top Secret material is intact. Among the documents
                            lost was the emergency plan for the evacuation of Taiwan in certain
                            contingencies.</p>
                        <p>The acquittal verdict of the court martial had touched Chinese National
                            feeling at a very tender spot—namely, hatred of extraterritoriality. It
                            seemed probable that the government had permitted the demonstration to
                            begin as a means of applying a little pressure on the United States.
                            Thereafter the matter got out of hand.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> intervened to
                            point out that we were even now negotiating a status-of-forces agreement
                            with the Chinese National Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> went on to say
                            that it was not yet clear whether or not the Communists had had a hand
                            in starting the uprising. Certainly as yet there was no clear evidence
                            of Communist participation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> said he was also inclined to doubt the validity
                            of the charge that the Generalissimo’s son had started the uprising,
                            though this charge had been made by a high Kuomintang official.
                            Nevertheless, certain reports stated that some Chinese Nationalist
                            officers had viewed the whole sequence of events with satisfaction, and
                            that the affair had been planned this way. Meanwhile, Communist
                            propaganda from mainland China has been having a field day, as has
                            Moscow, which is studiously following Peiping’s line.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> concluded by stating
                            that some considerable interval would be required before a sound
                            analysis of these happenings could be provided. Meanwhile, he still
                            doubted the existence of a strong and deep anti-American feeling in
                            Formosa, or very deep Communist penetration in the island. We should
                            know better what had happened, and why, in two or three weeks’ time.</p>

                                files.</note> I share your feeling that it was much better for you
                            and your party to have left Taipei when you did, thereby missing the
                            excitement on the afternoon of May 24. I first learned of the riot after
                            my return to Taipei, where I had hoped to find you at the airport. As
                            you know, the military plane which was to have brought me earlier turned
                            back on account of weather, and my proposal to fly direct to Manila was
                            given up in the absence of a reply to the telegram I sent to you early
                            on May 24.<note n="2" target="d262fn2">Not found in Department of State
                                files.</note></p>
                        <p>Apparently you are seeing our current telegrams and despatches, so I
                            shall try not to repeat their contents here. But since you ask for an
                            opinion on the long term outlook I shall venture a few observations.</p>
                        <p>As you know, of course, we have no military bases in Free China. The only
                            United States tactical forces stationed here at the present time are a
                            Matador unit and a fighter-bomber squadron, consisting of a few hundred
                            men altogether. We have hoped to avoid any need for American ground
                            forces on Taiwan, or for anything that could be called a “base”, except
                            perhaps in the event of a large scale war in this area which directly
                            involved the United States. Otherwise, <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543"
                                facs="0571"/>the plan is to use Chinese facilities, which we have
                            helped to develop under our mutual defense assistance program and which
                            are available to us under the broad terms of our bilateral treaty, for
                            any American tactical units which circumstances may require to be
                            stationed here from time to time. So far this plan has worked well,
                            rather better than in many countries where we have actual bases. Its
                            success obviously is contingent upon good relations with the local
                            government and people. But the value of a formal military base in a
                            foreign country, no matter what the treaty provisions may be, is
                            scarcely less dependent upon local relationships.</p>
                        <p>While our tactical forces in Free China are small, the remainder of the
                            official American family here is substantial, totaling over 8000
                            including dependents. These belong to a variety of agencies, largely
                            military. All American military personnel now stationed in Free China,
                            as you may recall, enjoy the provisions of the 1951 “<gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Agreement” which gives them
                            diplomatic privileges and immunities. The originally approved strength
                            of our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> was less than 800. No
                            dependents came with them. Now we have about 4000 military personnel,
                            plus a similar number of dependents. Obviously the situation is quite
                            different from that foreseen when the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> was set up six years ago. And among the 75 percent or
                            so who are not in tactical units today, Parkinson’s Law is in full
                            operation. The same is true among United States civilian officials here,
                            of course, although their number is measured in hundreds rather than
                            thousands. (Combat forces, stationed abroad presumably obey some other
                            “law”, but they are a secondary factor on Taiwan in any case.)</p>
                        <p>Our negotiations during past months for a status of forces agreement with
                            China have established a substantial identity of views on virtually all
                            points except that of criminal jurisdiction. The recent
                                <persName>Reynolds</persName>’ case, and the ensuing riot on May 24,
                            obviously have contributed nothing toward the resolution of these
                            differences, but perhaps they have cleared the air. One of my tentative
                            and reluctant conclusions is that an American serviceman could not be
                            assured of a fair trial in a Chinese court. The argument can be advanced
                            that, on the average, Chinese courts would be more lenient than
                            American. But we do not regard one of our fellow citizens, whatever his
                            rank, as a mere statistic. The idea is repugnant to us that even one
                            innocent man should suffer at the hands of any court of law. If we could
                            be sure in advance that a man was guilty as charged, and that a Chinese
                            court would punish him no more severely than an American court, it might
                            be a different matter. Perhaps the Girard case in Japan falls in some
                            such category, but how can we cover this point in general agreements
                            with foreign countries?</p>
                        <p>Frankly, I see no complete solution, particularly for a worldwide problem
                            such as that which faces us. But there are certain remedial <pb n="544"
                                xml:id="pg_544" facs="0572"/>measures which can be taken now, with
                            others to be developed in the future. One that we should start on
                            immediately is the systematic reduction in numbers of American official
                            personnel, military and civilian, stationed in Free China. (I exclude
                            tactical or combat forces as involving a separate set of
                            considerations.) Doubtless well over half of our non-combat American
                            personnel are engaged in housekeeping of some kind. This stems in part
                            from the normal operation of Parkinson’s Law, but also from a
                            multiplicity of organizations and complex chains of command. Here on
                            Taiwan we have some 15 lines of authority from agencies in Washington to
                            their local representatives. This encourages the building of separate
                            little empires, and some not so little.</p>
                        <p>As a corollary to the remedy just mentioned, we should use “indigenous”
                            (unhappy word!) personnel wherever possible. Often, they actually are
                            better, both for linguistic and other reasons, than the type of
                            Americans available for positions of minor responsibility. There is much
                            less turnover among them, and we need not be concerned appreciably with
                            either their morale or their morals. In this way, plus the consolidation
                            of duplicate housekeeping facilities and the elimination of structures
                            which have outlived their concept, we can reduce very substantially the
                            scope of our problem. In this process we should be able to bring about
                            the largest reduction in precisely the categories of American personnel
                            who most frequently get into trouble abroad.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing comments, of course, deal with only one general aspect of
                            our governmental operations outside the United States, but I assume that
                            your special interest lies in this field. It is an important feature of
                            our broad effort to confront the communist menace firmly and
                            successfully without alienating our friends abroad by what now appears
                            to many of them as neo-colonialism.</p>
                        <p>I am sorry to have missed you in Taipei, but what we might have discussed
                            then would have been overtaken by events.</p>
                        <p>Best regards.</p>

                        <p>1. The draft speech is a clear and eloquent brief of the present US
                            position on Communist China. In my judgment, it suffers from the same
                            basic defect as the policy itself. It assumes that the present policy
                            can succeed without analyzing either its prospects or its costs.</p>

                                <item>Any move by the US which appears to be in the direction of
                                    accommodation to the Chinese Communists will: (1) increase the

                                    in Taiwan; and (3) dispose the Asian friends of the US to move
                                    toward closer and possibly dangerous relationships with the

                            </list></p>
                        <p>3. From these premises the speech draws the following policy conclusions: <list>

                                <item>The US should not recognize Communist China;</item>

                        <p rend="center">II.</p>
                        <p>4. The premises of US policy as described above are largely unassailable
                            as far as they go. In some respects the speech seems to me to overstate
                            the effects of a less rigid US policy and to ignore the extent of
                            existing contacts by other nations with Communist China. Even so, this
                            part of the analysis seems to me generally acceptable. But that is only
                            half of the story. In choosing a policy, it is essential not only to
                            assess its advantages but also its prospects and costs. Only then can
                            one course be intelligently weighed against other courses. The speech
                            describes eloquently the possible benefits from the present policy. It
                            fails to consider at all its costs or its chances of success. That is
                            why I feel that the analysis and policy are inadequate.</p>
                        <p>5. This omission does not seem to me to invalidate the first policy
                            conclusion: that the US should not now recognize Communist China.
                            Recognition is ours alone to give or withhold; it costs little or
                            nothing to withhold it; we derive no clear benefits from bestowing it
                            now. In my judgment, however, we tend to extend the idea further than is
                            necessary or serves our own interest. For example, I think it would be
                            in our interest to allow reporters to go to China and to include China
                            in any disarmament agreement. Neither of these actions appears to me
                            incompatible with continued non-recognition. Thus our own refusal to
                            recognize can be maintained without incurring undue costs in other
                            respects.</p>
                        <p>6. That is not the case as to the second policy conclusion. In effect,
                            that commits us to engaging our prestige and expending our political
                            resources in a continuing effort to deprive the Chinese Communists of
                            economic and political relations with the rest of the world.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III.</p>
                        <p>7. This is where both the analysis and the policy seem to me to go
                            astray. The reason is simple. I do not believe that over the long run,
                            or even in the fairly near term, the effort to isolate Communist China
                            as a pariah will succeed. We have already seen the British take the lead
                            in doing away with the China differential. There can be little doubt
                            that our other friends will in the near future follow that lead. And in
                            the field of political relations we are, in the instances of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly and the specialized
                            agencies, at the mercy <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0575"/>of a
                            majority over which we cannot expect to maintain control for very long.
                            Other nations, including many which fear and dislike Communist China, do
                            not agree with the US approach to the problem. They are increasingly
                            likely to conclude that their interests will be better served by
                            recognizing Red China and having it within the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> framework. Before long, a simple majority can defeat our
                            efforts to isolate the Chinese Communists and can seat them in one of
                            the specialized agencies or in the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>8. Granted that any US adjustment of its posture toward the Chinese
                            Communists will entail risks, we must weigh these risks against those we
                            run if we continue adamant in our present position and are then
                            defeated. The consequences in that case, I believe, would be
                            formidable.</p>

                                        useful and constructive activity in building free Asia. Our
                                        policy already suffers severely from this fault. The speech
                                        itself illustrates this failing. It focuses mainly on the
                                        negative task of isolating the Chinese Communists, and
                                        largely neglects the serious problems of developing strong

                        <p>9. Thus in the final analysis the consequences of sticking to our present
                            policy are likely to be disastrous in terms of our interests and our
                            influence. The results of this course seem to me far more serious than
                            those of available alternatives even if one accepts the premises on
                            which our policy and the speech are based.</p>
                        <p rend="center">IV.</p>
                        <p>10. Hence we should seek gradually to recast our policy into a more
                            durable mold. Our aims should be (a) to insure the continuance of an
                            independent Taiwan with membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>; (b) to enlist greater free world support for our basic
                            position regarding Communist China; and (c) to minimize the damage to US
                            influence and interests if and when Communist China is admitted to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>11. In practice, this means that we should move toward a “Two-China”
                            policy. Such a policy would involve recognition that neither “China”
                            would absorb the other; it would call for eventual recognition of both
                            countries by most states (but not necessarily by US); it would call for
                            resolving various issues in relation to <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> seating which might consume a lengthy period of
                            time.</p>
                        <p>12. Adoption of such a policy by the US would undoubtedly trouble our
                            Formosan friends. But it would: <list>

                        <p>13. The fact that neither “China” will today accept such a concept is an
                            advantage, not a handicap. For we now need most of all to disengage our
                            prestige, cushion the unsettling effects of any adjustment of our
                            posture, and establish a position that we can live with. This will take
                            time. The unwillingness of either “China” to accept the other as a
                            permanent entity will help us to buy time.</p>
                        <p>14. I do not suggest that your speech should explicitly espouse a
                            Two-China solution. As a first step, it would be sufficient to begin
                            restating our position on Chinese Communist entry into the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in ways which do not nail our flag to the
                            mast. Our opposition might be stated in a more conditional form. Indeed,
                            we need not specify all <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0577"/>the
                            conditions at this time. Three prerequisites are obvious; (a) the
                            release of the US prisoners; (b) continued independence and <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership for Taiwan; (c) renunciation
                            of use of force by Chinese Communists to recover Taiwan. The crucial
                            thing is to avoid digging ourselves further into a position which will
                            ultimately cost us dearly in influence and in the protection of our
                            interests in the Far East. <note n="4" xml:id="d263fn4"><p>Attached to

                                    the Secretary, also dated June 19. This memorandum is a brief
                                    addendum to the source text which grew out of <persName
                                        corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName>’s discussion of his
                                    initial memorandum with the Secretary. The text of this
                                    “Addendum on San Francisco Speech” reads as follows:</p>
                                <p>“I should like to clarify one point which arose in our discussion
                                    of my memorandum on your draft speech. You asked whether my
                                    comments merely came down to the view that we should stop
                                    fighting for what was right because we were sure to lose.</p>
                                <p>“As I told you, this is not my point. My basic premise is that we
                                    are engaged in a contest with Communist China which is likely to
                                    go on for a long time. In that contest, we must husband our
                                    capabilities and use them effectively if we are to succeed. In
                                    so far as we dissipate our means or devote them to impractical
                                    goals, we weaken our chances for longer-term success.</p>
                                <p>“My criticism of our present policy is directed at this very
                                    point. Our present policy seems to me inadequate because it will
                                    fail to achieve its goals and in the process will impair our
                                    ability to protect our interests thereafter. It seems to me that
                                    it will use up our means, impair our influence, and ultimately
                                    weaken the forces opposed to Communist China. Thus I believe it
                                    will not serve the main purposes we should have in the Far
                                    East.</p>
                                <p>“The situation is similar to that which often faces a general.
                                    His strategy may well require withdrawals in one sector in order
                                    to promote ultimate success in the campaign. So it is here as I
                                    see it. To engage our full prestige and influence along the
                                    present lines seems to me a grave mistake if we consider the
                                    consequences for the long-term campaign.”</p></note></p>

                                        June 18, 1957, is his major ideological statement since 1949

                                        novelty of his thesis that ‘contradictions’ can exist in a

                                        leaders, he makes major admissions of weakness in the
                                        Chinese Communist system. He acknowledges serious
                                        difficulties in agriculture and states that it will take at
                                        least five years to persuade the peasants of the superiority
                                        of the collective farm system that was instituted in
                                        Communist China in 1955–56. He concedes problems with
                                        intellectuals and technically trained personnel, only a few
                                        of whom have become Communists. Among students, he admits,

                                <item><p>The speech contains a striking reaffirmation of the
                                        dictatorial principles by which the Chinese Communists
                                        govern. “Classes, strata, and social groups” which support
                                        the cause of “socialist construction” are defined by
                                            <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> as
                                        constituting “the people”. Those who oppose are defined as
                                        “enemies of the people”. Dictatorship is used to suppress
                                        enemies of the people; “democratic centralism” is applied
                                        among the people. In resolving “contradictions” among the
                                        people both “administrative orders” (i.e. force) and

                                        by force; “persuasion” is needed, but this can be
                                        “complemented” by administrative orders.</p>

                                        dissatisfaction with the Communist regime is quite marked.
                                        The “turbulent class struggles” of the early days are over,
                                        he says, but “time is needed for our socialist system to
                                        grow and consolidate, for the masses to get accustomed to
                                        the new system, and for government workers to study and
                                        acquire experience”.</p></item>

                                <item><persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> reveals in his
                                    speech that many people in Communist China were in sympathy with
                                    the Hungarian uprising of last year. “Certain people” were
                                    “delighted” when the events in Hungary occurred and hoped that
                                    “something similar” would happen in China and that “thousands
                                    upon thousands of people would demonstrate against the People’s
                                    Government”. Others took a “wavering attitude” because they were
                                    ignorant of the “actual world situation”. These people felt that
                                    there was “too little freedom” under “our people’s democracy”
                                    and asked for the adoption of the “two-party system of the
                                    West”. <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> then proceeds

                                <item>The speech is quite defensive about the peasant’s attitude
                                    toward collectivization of agriculture. A “miniature typhoon”
                                    was whipped up, <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> says,
                                    by critics of the cooperatives who failed to make a
                                    “comprehensive study of the achievements and shortcomings of the
                                    cooperatives”. Significantly, <persName corresp="#p_MT1"
                                        >Mao</persName> claims only that 70% of the rural population
                                    are “staunch” supporters of the cooperatives. Although he states
                                    that most of the rest “cherish hopes” for the future of the
                                    cooperatives, this amounts to an admission of considerable lack
                                    of support for the collectivization program.</item>

                                <item><persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> also admits to
                                    difficulties in Tibet. Conditions there, he says, are not yet
                                    “ripe” for the carrying out of “democratic reforms”. This can be
                                    done “only when the great majority of the people of Tibet and
                                    their leading public figures consider it practicable”. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> goes on to say that it has
                                    been decided not to proceed with democratic reform in Tibet
                                    during the period of the second five-year plan (1958–1962).
                                    Whether it will be done during the third five-year plan will
                                    depend, he says, on the situation at the time.</item>

                                        considerable space to the policy of “letting a hundred
                                        flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend”.
                                        He makes it clear that the Chinese Communists have
                                        particularly in mind the need to promote the “flourishing of
                                        the arts and the progress of science”. From this it would
                                        appear that <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> is
                                        afraid of the intellectual sterility in these fields which
                                        authoritarianism often produces. <persName corresp="#p_MT1"
                                            >Mao</persName> also advances the thesis that more
                                        discussion of ideas is needed to strengthen the ideological
                                        hold of the Communist <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552"

                                        says, “is like being vaccinated—a man develops greater
                                        immunity from disease after the vaccine takes effect.” But
                                        he warns that the “hundred flowers” policy does not give
                                        “counter-revolutionaries and wreckers of the socialist
                                        cause” freedom to advance “non-Marxist ideas”. This danger
                                        is dealt with easily. “We simply deprive them of their
                                        freedom of speech”.</p>

                                        criteria. The gist of these is that words and actions which
                                        support the regime and the Communist bloc as a whole are
                                        “fragrant flowers”; those which hinder are “poisonous
                                        weeds”.</p></item>

                                        >Mao</persName> gives further significant evidence of
                                    discontent among the people. “In 1956”, he says, “small numbers
                                    of workers and students in certain places went on strike”. Also
                                    members of “a small number” of agricultural cooperatives
                                    “created disturbances”. These outbreaks <persName
                                        corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> ascribes to failure to
                                    satisfy demands for material benefits and to “bureaucracy” on
                                    the part of leaders. The solution to the problem, as he sees it,
                                    is to stamp out bureaucracy and improve the education work of
                                    the regime.</item>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that at
                            long last <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName>’s speech of
                            February 1957 had been released by Peiping in the official version. It
                            had likewise been published in <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> today.
                            While the official text had been doctored, it still contained many of
                            the most significant points covered in the earlier texts of what
                                <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> had said. After describing
                            some of these points, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            prophesied that the speech would constitute the ideological basis for
                            the Government of Communist China for some time to come. Moreover, the
                            speech certainly indicated differing trends in Communist China and in
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> also noted a withdrawal
                            of significant numbers of Chinese Communist troops from Tibet. He
                            believed that these troops were being withdrawn in the face of
                            Tibetan-inspired difficulties, on the one hand, and for reasons of
                            economy, on the other. The Chinese Communists would presumably attempt
                            to win the allegiance of Tibetans by different methods than the military
                            methods of the past.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether the stationing of Chinese Communist troops
                            in Tibet had not been considered a means of maintaining pressure on
                            India. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that
                            this was certainly a consideration in the deployment of Chinese
                            Communist forces in Tibet.</p>

                            that the State Department had had any report from representatives of the
                            Department resident in the area, with respect to the Communist shelling
                            of the offshore islands.<note n="3" xml:id="d266fn3">In telegram 1363
                                from Taipei, June 25, the Embassy reported that 9,000 shells had
                                fallen on Little Kinmen island in 1 hour and 15 minutes. The Embassy
                                speculated that the most plausible explanation for the heavy fire
                                directed at Little Kinmen was that “it dominates entrance Amoy
                                harbor and Reds may wish neutralize it in order facilitate greater
                                use of harbor following British de-embargo”. There is no indication
                                in the telegram that the information cited was derived from reports

                            would not be in the least surprised if it had been the Nationalists who
                            had initiated these artillery exchanges. Secretary <persName

                            not get reports on such events, and as to what is going on in the Quemoy
                            area, from representatives of the Department of Defense .…</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> expressed the
                            view that now that the Chinese Communists had completed their new
                            railroad into Amoy, they wanted to open up the Port of Amoy to shipping.
                            Accordingly, they might wish either to seize or to neutralize the small
                            islands—Little Quemoy, Tatan and Ehrtan—which could block entrance to
                            the Port of Amoy. It was suggested that the absence of official U.S.
                            reports on this stepped-up shelling might indicate that our people in
                            this area regarded the matter as no great departure from the routine
                            artillery exchanges between the Communists and the Nationalists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to comment on
                            the movement of a light bomber group of Chinese Communist IL–28s in the
                            direction of the Amoy area. He closed his comments on the general topic
                            of the offshore islands by stating that there existed no real evidence
                            that the <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0584"/>Chinese Communists
                            were about to try to seize these offshore islands at the present time.
                            He pointed out, however, that there were plenty of Chinese Communist
                            troops in the general area if a decision to move were made.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Henderson</persName> brought up the problem of lack of
                            information on recent military action with respect to the islands off
                            the Chinese coast. He mentioned that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had expressed concern over the
                            lack of information at his staff meeting this morning and asked whether
                            there are some of our own military people on the islands who can report
                            what is going on. The State Department feels that the situation is such
                            that almost anything could happen and that there is a real need for
                            reports on almost an hour-to-hour basis. <persName corresp="#p_CLGCP1"
                                >General Cabell</persName> reported that his agency had received a
                            report this morning from their station out there to the effect that last
                            night’s bombardment had been very heavy. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Admiral Radford</persName> said that we had established our own
                            military forces on Quemoy Island precisely in order to be able to obtain
                            quick and reliable information. We need to know whether the reports
                            coming from the off-shore islands are Chinese Nationalist reports only
                            or whether they are confirmed by U.S. observers on the islands. He said
                            that press inquiries here make it important that our observers on the
                            islands anticipate insofar as possible needs in Washington for up to the
                            minute information. He requested <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral

                        <p>It is appropriate that in this great city of San Francisco, which faces
                            the Far East, we should consider our policies toward Communism in

                        <p>On the China mainland 600,000,000 people are ruled by the Chinese
                            Communist Party. That Party came to power by violence and, so far, has
                            lived by violence.</p>
                        <p>It retains power not by will of the Chinese people, but by massive,
                            forcible repression. It fought the United Nations in Korea, it supported
                            the Communist war in Indochina; it took Tibet by force. It fomented the
                            Communist Huk rebellion in the Philippines and the Communists’
                            insurrection in Malaya. It does not disguise its expansionist ambitions.
                            It is bitterly hateful of the United States, which it considers a
                            principal obstacle in the way of its path of conquest.</p>
                        <p>In the face of this condition the United States has supported; morally
                            and materially, the free nations of the Western Pacific and <pb n="559"

                            and that we would act accordingly.</p>

                        <p>As we review our China policy, we naturally and properly recall our
                            recognition policy as regards Communist Russia.</p>
                        <p>The Bolsheviks seized power from Kerensky in 1917. Nevertheless, we
                            continued for 16 years to treat the Kerensky representatives in exile as
                            the lawful government of Russia. By 1933, it seemed that the Communist
                            regime might be considered as a peaceful member of society. For more
                            than a decade it had committed no act of armed aggression. It had
                            accepted the independence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and of
                            Poland. It was not demonstrably maltreating American citizens. It
                            promised to cease subversive activities in the United States, to respect
                            American rights in Russia, and to settle Russia’s public and private
                            debts to the United States,</p>
                        <p>Also, by 1933, we desired to encourage the Soviet regime to resist
                            Japanese aggressive policies in the Far East. The Republic of China,
                            inspired by this same notion, had recognized the Soviet Government in
                            December 1932 and we shortly followed suit.</p>
                        <p>We need not question that act of recognition under the circumstances
                            which then prevailed. Recognition seemed indicated by most tests and we
                            did not read the future.</p>
                        <p>However, it can, I think, be said with confidence that recognition would
                            not have been accorded to the Soviet Union even in 1933 had there been
                            clear warning that the Soviet promises given in that connection were
                            totally unreliable, that aggressive war would soon become an
                            instrumentality of Soviet policy, and that it would be neutral toward
                            Japanese aggression in Asia.</p>

                        <p>The Republic of China is entitled to a permanent seat and “veto power” in
                            the Security Council. Should a regime which in seven years has promoted
                            5 foreign or civil wars—Korea, Indochina, Tibet, the Philippines, and
                            Malaya; which itself has fought the United Nations and has been found by
                            it to be an aggressor; which defies the United Nations’ decision to
                            reunify Korea, and which openly proclaims its continuing purpose to use
                            force—should that regime be given a permanent seat, with veto power, in
                            the body which under the Charter has “primary responsibility for the

                            could exist, to a limited degree, without recognition.</p>
                        <p>Normal peacetime trade with China, from which the American and Chinese
                            peoples would benefit, could be in the common interest. But it seems
                            that that kind of trade is not to be had in any appreciable volume.</p>
                        <p>Trade with Communist China is not a free trade. It does not provide one
                            country with what its people want, but cannot well produce for
                            themselves, in exchange for what other people want but cannot well
                            produce for themselves. Trade with Communist China is wholly controlled
                            by an official apparatus and its limited amounts of foreign exchange are
                            used to develop as rapidly as possible a formidable military
                            establishment and a heavy industry to support it. The primary desire of
                            that regime is for machine tools, electronic equipment, and, in general,
                            what will help it produce tanks, trucks, planes, ammunition, and other
                            military items.</p>
                        <p>Whatever others may do, surely the United States, which has heavy
                            security commitments in the China area, ought not build up the military
                            power of its potential enemy.</p>
                        <p>We also doubt the value of cultural exchanges, which the Chinese
                            Communists are eager to develop. They want this relationship with the
                            United States primarily because, once that example were given, it would
                            be difficult for China’s close neighbors not to follow <pb n="563"
                                xml:id="pg_563" facs="0591"/>it. These free nations, already exposed
                            to intense Communist subversive activities, could not have the cultural
                            exchanges that the Communists want without adding greatly to their
                            danger.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The “De Facto” Argument</hi></p>
                        <p>These are the considerations which argue for a continuance of our present
                            policies. What are the arguments on the other side?</p>
                        <p>There are some who say that we should accord diplomatic recognition to
                            the Communist regime because it has now been in power so long that it
                            has won the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to that.</p>
                        <p>That is not sound international law. Diplomatic recognition is always a
                            privilege, never a right.</p>
                        <p>Of course, the United States recognizes that the Chinese Communist regime
                            exists. We well know that it exists, for it has fought in Korea. Also,
                            we admit of dealing with the Chinese Communists in particular cases
                            where that may serve our interests. We have dealt with it in relation to
                            the Korean and Indochina Armistices. For nearly two years we have been,
                            and still are, dealing with it in an effort to free our citizens and to
                            obtain reciprocal renunciations of force.</p>
                        <p>But diplomatic recognition gives the recognized regime valuable rights
                            and privileges, and, in the world of today, recognition by the United
                            States gives the recipient much added prestige and influence at home and
                            abroad.</p>
                        <p>Of course, diplomatic recognition is not to be withheld capriciously. In
                            this matter, as others, the United States seeks to act in accordance
                            with principles which contribute to a world society of order under
                            law.</p>
                        <p>A test often applied is the ability of a regime actually to govern. But
                            that is by no means a controlling factor. Nations often maintain
                            diplomatic relations with governments-in-exile. And they frequently deny
                            recognition to those in actual power.</p>
                        <p>Other customary tests are whether, as Thomas Jefferson put it, the
                            recognized government reflects “the will of the nation, substantially
                            declared”; whether the government conforms to the code of civilized
                            nations, lives peacefully and honors its international obligations.</p>
                        <p>Always, however, recognition is admitted to be an instrument of national
                            policy, to serve enlightened self-interest.</p>
                        <p>One thing is established beyond a doubt. There is nothing automatic about
                            recognition. It is nothing compelled by the mere lapse of time.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The “Inevitability” Argument</hi></p>
                        <p>Another argument is that diplomatic recognition is inevitable, so why not
                            now?</p>
                        <p>First of all, let me say emphatically that the United States need never
                            succumb to the argument of “inevitability”. We feel that we, with our
                            friends, can fashion our own destiny. We do not accept the mastery of
                            Communist forces.</p>
                        <p>And let me go on to say that Communist-type despotisms are not so
                            immutable as they sometimes appear. Time and circumstances work also
                            upon them.</p>
                        <p>There is often an optical illusion which results from the fact that
                            police states, suppressing differences, give an external appearance of
                            hard permanency; whereas the democracies with their opposition parties
                            and often speaking through different and discordant voices, seem the
                            unstable, pliable members of the world society.</p>
                        <p>The reality is, of course, that a governmental system which tolerates
                            diversity has a long life expectancy. And a system which seeks to impose
                            conformity is always in danger. That results from the basic nature of
                            human beings. Of all the arguments advanced for recognition of Communist
                            China, the least cogent is the argument of “inevitability”.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">China versus Russia</hi></p>
                        <p>There are some who suggest that if we assist the Chinese Communists to
                            wax strong, then they will eventually break with Soviet Russia and that
                            that is our best hope for the future.</p>
                        <p>There are no doubt basic power rivalries between Russia and China in
                            Asia. On the other hand, the Russian and Chinese Communist Parties are
                            bound together by close ideological ties.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps, if the ambitions of the Chinese Communists are inflated by
                            successes, they might eventually clash with Soviet Russia.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps, too, if the Axis Powers had won the Second World War, they would
                            have fallen out among themselves.</p>
                        <p>But no one suggested that we should tolerate and even assist an
                            Axis-victory because in the end they would quarrel over the booty—of
                            which we would be part.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi></p>
                        <p>We seek to appraise our China policies with an open mind and without
                            emotion, except for a certain indignation at the prolonged abuse of
                            American citizens in China. We have no feeling whatsoever that change is
                            to be avoided merely in the interest of consistency or because change
                            would imply past error.</p>
                        <p>We always take into account the possibility of influencing the Communist
                            regime to better ways if we had diplomatic relations with it, or if,
                            without that, we had commercial and cultural contacts with it. But the
                            experience of those who now recognize and deal with the Chinese
                            Communist regime convinces us that, under present conditions, neither
                            recognition, trade, nor cultural relations; nor all three, would
                            favorably influence the evolution of affairs in China. The probable
                            result, internally, would be the opposite of what we hope for.</p>
                        <p>Internationally the Chinese Communist regime does not conform to the
                            practices of civilized nations; does not live up to its international
                            obligations; has not been peaceful in the past, and gives no evidence of
                            being peaceful in the future. Its foreign policies are hostile to us and
                            our Asian allies. Under these circumstances, it would be folly for us to
                            establish relations with the Chinese Communists which would enhance
                            their ability to hurt us and our friends.</p>
                        <p>You may ask, “What of the future?” Are our policies merely negative? Do
                            we see any prospect of resuming the many friendly ties which, for many
                            generations, the American people have had with the Chinese people, and
                            which we want to have again?</p>
                        <p>Do we see any chance that the potentially great Chinese nation, with its
                            rich and ancient culture and wisdom, will again be able to play a
                            constructive part in the councils of the nations?</p>
                        <p>We confidently answer these questions in the affirmative. Our confidence
                            is based on certain fundamental beliefs. One is a belief in the future
                            of human freedom. We know that the materialistic rule of International
                            Communism will never permanently serve the aspirations with which human
                            beings are endowed by their Creator.</p>
                        <p>Within the Soviet Union the rulers have had to disavow Stalin’s brand of
                            Communism.</p>
                        <p>Within the satellites, even twelve years of indoctrination do not
                            persuade the people that the Soviet system satisfies either their
                            national or their individual desires.</p>
                        <p>Communism is equally repugnant to the Chinese people. We read the recent
                            brave words uttered within Red China by the university lecturer: “To
                            overthrow you cannot be called unpatriotic, because you Communists no
                            longer serve the people”.</p>
                        <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0594"/>
                        <p>The Chinese people are, above all, individualists. We can confidently
                            base our policies on the assumption that International Communism’s rule
                            of strict conformity is, in China as elsewhere, a passing and not a
                            perpetual phase. We owe it to ourselves, our allies and the Chinese
                            people to do all that we can to contribute to that passing.</p>
                        <p>If we believed that this passing would be promoted by trade and cultural
                            relations, then we would have such relations.</p>
                        <p>If we believed that this passing would be promoted by our having
                            diplomatic relations with the present regime, then we would have such
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>If we believed that this passing would be promoted by some participation
                            of the present regime in the activities of the United Nations, then we
                            would not oppose that.</p>
                        <p>We should be, and we are, constantly testing our policies, to be as
                            certain as we can be that, in the light of conditions as they from time
                            to time are, our policies shall serve the great purposes to which our
                            nation has been dedicated since its foundation—the cause of peace,
                            justice and human liberty.</p>
                        <p>Our policies are readily adjustable to meet the requirements of changing
                            conditions. But there are occasions when others, and not we, should
                            provide the change. Nothing could be more dangerous than for the United
                            States to operate on the theory that if hostile and evil forces do not
                            quickly or readily change, then it is we who must change to meet
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The United States exerts an immense influence in the world today, not
                            only because it is powerful, but because we stand for peace, for
                            national independence and personal liberty. Many free nations seek to
                            coordinate their foreign policies with ours. Such coordination is indeed
                            indispensable if the free world is to have the cohesion needed to make
                            it safe. But United States policies will never serve as rallying points
                            for free peoples if the impression is created that our policies are
                            subject to change to meet Communist wishes for no reason other than that
                            Communism does not want to change. If Communism is stubborn for the
                            wrong, let us be steadfast for the right.</p>
                        <p>The capacity to change is an indispensable capacity. Equally
                            indispensable is the capacity to hold fast that which is good. Given
                            those qualities, we can hopefully look forward to the day when those in
                            Asia who are yet free can confidently remain free, and when the people
                            of China and the people of America can resume their long history of
                            cooperative friendship.<note n="6" xml:id="d268fn6">On June 28, circular

                            construction, people’s livelihood, basic state system, and national and
                            international unity. One striking feature, in marked contrast previous
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> reports, is overwhelming
                            concentration on domestic problems and policies. Only minute fraction
                            devoted to international, including bloc, affairs.</p>
                        <p>2. Speech constitutes regime’s official exposition of counter-offensive
                            against subversive criticism which has been developing since second week
                            June. Various criticisms striking at fundamentals of regime rejected in
                            firm, uncompromising manner. Two lines taken: (a) insistence that
                            achievements of regime are main thing and its mistakes and shortcomings
                            secondary; (b) strong reaffirmation validity and permanence basic
                            features of Communist rule. Key section is fourth, in which <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> makes clear no attempt undermine
                            people’s democratic dictatorship under <gloss target="#t_CCP1"
                                >CCP</gloss> leadership will be tolerated. Any movement in direction
                            Western-style democracy and two or multiparty political system
                            categorically rejected. Dominant position of <gloss target="#t_CCP1"
                                >CCP</gloss> reaffirmed at length, with <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> terming essential “firm, strong core of leadership
                            by Communist Party in all government institutions, schools, enterprises,
                            and popular organizations” and in effect rebuffing demands for clear
                            division of function between party and government. “Blooming flowers,
                            contending schools” policy given only passing, lip-service mention.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> reendorsed united front
                            concept, stipulating however that “Communist Party is guiding force and
                            core of united front and common goal of struggle for people of entire
                            country”. Fourth section concluded with statement regime welcomed
                            criticism its work, but must be constructive, i.e. posited on acceptance
                            of socialism.</p>
                        <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0596"/>
                        <p>3. Tone of speech generally harsh, more so in original Chinese.
                            “Rightist” critics said not acting good faith, accused of slandering
                            regime and trying wrench state power from Communist Party and shift
                            country from socialist to capitalist path. “Some individuals or groups
                            who now part of people may become enemy of people if persist
                            anti-socialist position,” <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>
                            warned, in concluding section. This accompanied however, by heavy stress
                            on desirability internal unity and by expression hope that “rightists,
                            helped by outside prodding and profiting by own experiences and
                            increased awareness will repent and accept opportunities of remoulding
                            themselves”. If small number refuses seize this opportunity and persist
                            in reactionary stand, “they will cut themselves away from people”. Not
                            clear how this policy to be translated into action, but while earlier
                            rectification campaign language of “gentle breeze, mild rain” absent,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s words suggest regime
                            desires avoid large-scale purge. Of possible significance that Lung Yun,
                            one of leading targets of recent attacks, retains position on <gloss

                        <p>4. Noteworthy feature of speech is strikingly defensive tone throughout.
                            Can fairly be described as essentially exhaustive refutation of charges
                            of abuses, failures, and basic defects to which regime exposed past few
                            months. As examples, <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> cited
                            and sought move but [<hi rend="italic">rebut</hi>?] criticism that first
                            five-year plan “bungled”, planned purchasing and marketing “been pretty
                            mess”, living standards lower than under Kuomintang, high officials are
                            “exploiters”, proletarian dictatorship root of bureaucratism,
                            sectarianism and subjectivism. Great pains taken by <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> to refute these criticisms is
                            significant in indicating how strong and widespread recent upwelling of
                            popular dissatisfaction and protest been.</p>
                        <p>5. In discussing democratic centralism in fourth section <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> admitted central authorities “taken
                            too much into their own hands” in past two years, resulting in rigidity
                            of administration. Following examination of government structure, regime
                            now decided “make suitable readjustments expanding powers local
                            authorities.” Bearing in mind intention carry out some decentralization
                            government operations also mentioned at <gloss target="#t_NPC1"
                                >NPC</gloss> session last June, meaningfulness and importance this
                            statement should not be exaggerated.</p>
                        <p>6. Bloc affairs and Sino-Soviet relationship received only cursory and
                            incidental coverage. In section on socialist construction five year plan
                            achievements called “inseparable from assistance given us by people and
                            government Soviet Union.” Dealing with international unity in last
                            section, <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> argued Hungarian
                            incident had been “deep, useful lesson” to all Bloc countries and
                            resulted in strengthening, not weakening, its unity. Standard line on
                            consolidating unity of socialist camp headed by Soviet Union and based
                            on principles proletarian internationalism and equality among nations
                            reiterated.</p>
                        <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0597"/>
                        <p>7. Treatment of international scene very brief and contains no
                            significant departure from or addition to standard line as expounded,
                            for example, in <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s March 5
                            speech to <gloss target="#t_CPPCC1">CPPCC</gloss>. In keeping with
                            general strategy trying isolate United States from allies, argument
                            advanced “in almost all countries dominated by United States there is
                            louder and more insistent demand for putting end to United States
                            control, for adoption of policy of peace and neutrality, and in
                            opposition to aggressive military blocs.” In this connection claim made
                            people on Taiwan launched large-scale movement against United States;
                            new propaganda angle injected with argument this occurred immediately
                            following stationing Matador unit on island. “Liberation of Taiwan” by
                            peaceful or other means not mentioned at all.</p>

                                    economic standpoint, speech reaffirmed seriousness
                                    over-extension last year and decision to attempt lower rate
                                    growth 1957, ease imbalances and rebuild reserves. Speech
                                    defensive in tone; contended achievements 1956 far outweighed

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. The Government of the Republic of China
                            has asked United States authorities to reconsider its previous requests
                            for the purchase of more Public Law 480, Title I, surplus agricultural
                            commodities, totaling US$23.65 million in export value. The Embassy does
                            not believe the request can be justified on the grounds of economic need
                            or of agricultural sales promotion by the U.S.</p>
                        <p>A very considerable part of the commodities requested—wheat, cotton and
                            barley in the total amount of US$15.7 million—would actually strain
                            available storage and financing facilities in Taiwan if delivered in the
                            fiscal year 1958 and would complicate further the problems of disposing
                            of large rice stocks.</p>
                        <p>The Taiwan economy in 1958 could absorb modest amounts of soybean oil,
                            canned lard, tobacco, tallow, and dairy products (totaling some US$5.2
                            million in value) and could probably do so without increasing
                            consumption requirements significantly and therefore without increasing
                            the island’s dependence upon U.S. aid. Sale of these commodities might
                            help to keep prices down somewhat and doubtless would help appease some
                            Chinese officials who have expressed dissatisfaction with the relatively
                            small amount of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 aid that has been
                            granted to China to date.</p>
                        <p>However, it has already proven very difficult to develop projects
                            requiring <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 derived local currency,
                            which are mutually acceptable to the Country Team, the <gloss

                            and the Chinese Government. In view of the large amounts of local
                            currency that are constantly building up under the regular aid program
                            it will prove even more difficult to find beneficial uses for additional

                                Tseng Kuang-chih had been a student at several American universities
                                since 1948 and had suffered from mental illness periodically during
                                that time. In March 1956 he had applied for an extension of his stay
                                in the United States, but after being admitted to a mental hospital
                                in Indiana in May 1956 he had expressed a desire to return to China.
                                As soon as he was physically able to do so, and an escort could be
                                arranged for him, Tseng was permitted to return to China.</note>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ 28 June address
                            on China policy has evoked formal and informal response from the Chinese
                            Communists. At the final session of the National People’s Congress
                            (Peiping’s legislative assembly) on 15 July, <persName corresp="#p_CH1"
                                >Chang Han-fu</persName>, a deputy foreign minister, gave what might
                            be described as the regime’s formal reply to the Secretary’s speech.
                            Meanwhile <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> has been
                            telling newsmen and visiting delegations that China can wait a hundred
                            years for US recognition and has no need for “friends of <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ kind.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CH1">Chang Han-fu</persName>’s speech concentrated
                            on what the Chinese Communists probably consider the Secretary’s main
                            arguments against US recognition of Peiping: the record of aggression,
                            the value of US recognition in relation to Peiping’s ambitions in
                            Southeast Asia, and the stability of the Peiping regime.
                                <persName>Chang</persName> charged that the US, not Communist China,
                            was guilty of successive armed aggression. The Korean hostilities and
                            uprisings in Tibet, he charged, were fomented by the US. He claimed that
                            it was not within US power to bar Peiping’s contacts with other
                            countries and that the trade embargo actually helped Communist China by
                            bringing about “economic independence” and greater cooperation within
                            the bloc while it harmed the relations between the US and its allies.
                                <persName>Chang</persName> rejected the notion that criticism by the
                            “rightists” is connected with the regime’s stability.</p>
                        <p>Particularly irritating to the Chinese Communists has been the reference
                            to criticisms of the Communist Party by non-Communists in China as proof
                            of the regime’s unpopularity and weakness. A 3 July editorial in <hi
                                rend="italic">People’s Daily</hi> stated that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, like Acheson, based US hopes on
                            “democratic individualists” but that much less could be expected from
                            this insignificant group now than in 1949. The editorial claimed that
                            this group became disillusioned with the US by the publication of the
                            1949 White Paper, <hi rend="italic">United States Relations With
                                China</hi>.<note n="2" xml:id="d272fn2">Department of State, <hi

                        </list>
                        <p>The Secretary opened the meeting by saying we were thinking of letting a
                            limited number of American correspondents go to Communist China. But
                            general travel was not in the interests of our foreign policy. Treatment
                            of Americans in Communist China had been bad. This Government could not
                            relinquish its responsibility for the protection of Americans.</p>
                        <p>Legally, we would be on much sounder grounds if we just said no to travel
                            of American correspondents to Communist China. It would be hard to
                            justify exceptions. Newsgathering was supposed to have an exception. But
                            other professions did not recognize this. Representatives of the
                            National Council of Churches have spoken of wanting to send members to
                            Communist China. We were not sure the door could be opened without our
                            being forced to let everybody go in.</p>
                        <p>We had come to the conclusion that we were willing to let a limited
                            number of correspondents go in—10 to 15, if the press would be willing
                            to share responsibility to decide who those will be. Juridically we were
                            on more dangerous grounds if we tried to pick and choose.</p>
                        <p>Limitation had occurred in other cases, as in time of war. This situation
                            was analogous, because we were in a state of semi-war with Communist
                            China.</p>
                        <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0603"/>
                        <p>It had been suggested that the correspondents be limited to the agencies
                            which demonstrated their interest and developed an experience in China
                            prior to the take-over.</p>
                        <p>If that seemed a reasonable basis, and if the newsgathering community
                            would share responsibility for the selection, we would be willing to do
                            so on an experimental basis. If this would lead to the release of
                            Americans now in China, this could lead to enlarging the experiment. If
                            the only result was to induce others to go, and particularly if an
                            adverse court decision was rendered, we would have to call the whole
                            thing off. The experiment would be for six months, then we would review
                            it.</p>
                        <p>There would be no reciprocity, with Chinese Communists sending news
                            representatives here. We did not recognize the Chinese Communist
                            passport.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded that we were prepared to think along those lines
                            if the gentlemen present thought it possible to do so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Koop</persName> asked how many the Secretary thought might
                            want to go, all told. The Secretary said perhaps many thousands.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Luce</persName> wondered whether this could be worked out
                            on the basis of correspondents from organizations now maintaining
                            correspondents abroad at several posts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Wiggins</persName> thought the number would be limited
                            automatically by various circumstances. An effort should be made to find
                            out how many would like to go.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight</persName> said some organizations
                            not represented in China in 1949 would like to send correspondents.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Becker</persName> explained the legal problems involved in
                            connection with permitting correspondents to go to Communist China.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was thinking of the right of the American public to
                            be informed. They would be informed of developments in Communist China
                            through a limited group. Opening the door completely would open it also
                            to other professions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Hurleigh</persName> said there would be an avalanche of
                            applicants from individual TV-radio stations because sponsors of
                            programs would finance the sending of correspondents. There are 2,500 to
                            3,000 stations. The TV-radio networks would like to have 20 Americans
                            go. These would include sound and film men.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Berding\</persName> said there are now 12 American
                            correspondents in Moscow, representing 8 organizations. The radio
                            correspondents there do not have sound and film men with them, but use
                            local facilities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight</persName> said his organization
                            (ANPA) was opposed to any limitation, believing in the right of American
                            newspapermen to go anywhere. He had confidence in Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, but any limitation could be
                            used against the American people by a future administration. <pb n="576"
                                xml:id="pg_576" facs="0604"/>ANPA would be willing to appeal to
                            newspapers for restraint in sending correspondents to China. The
                            limitation had to be the responsibility of the Department.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Wiggins</persName> said the Government is taking the
                            position that a free flow of news can be limited. He thought the
                            Communist Chinese would not throw the doors open wide to an unlimited
                            number of American newsmen. The Secretary agreed with this last
                            statement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight</persName> asked
                            whether the Department had asked the Chinese Communist Government if
                            they would agree to admit any newspaperman who applied. The Secretary
                            replied, no.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the
                            Chinese Communists severely restrict the movements of foreign
                            correspondents. The Look magazine men who went in wrote only what the
                            Commies wanted them to about a flourishing agriculture, whereas just a
                            few days later Mao himself had to admit a crisis in agriculture.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we were trying to get the American people adequately
                            informed by 10 to 15 correspondents. We had to stop at that. If the
                            representatives present thought that was worse than nothing, then we
                            would not do it. We were trying to find an opportunity to get the
                            American people better informed. Americans in Communist China were being
                            mistreated. It was not worthy of the dignity of a great nation to let
                            Americans go indiscriminately into that death-trap. In the Secretary’s
                            opinion the three news agencies and the three major networks would
                            provide adequate coverage. But if it was necessary to open the gates
                            wide in order to get adequate coverage, there was no use starting at
                            all.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Wiggins</persName> said the news organizations could not
                            let the Government decide how many newspapermen were adequate to cover
                            the news.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said if they wanted to stand on principle, then we would
                            stand where we were today, without changing.<note n="3" xml:id="d273fn3"
                                    ><p>On July 22, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                                    discussed with the President the position taken by the
                                    representatives of the news media on July 18:</p>
                                <p>“The President felt that it would be very difficult to find a
                                    stopping point once we started. He felt that perhaps the best
                                    thing to do was to stick to the line that until the Americans
                                    were released we would not permit any Americans to go in. This
                                    was clear and logical. The President said he realized it was
                                    pretty difficult to take on the opposition of all the news
                                    media. I said, however, that that did not worry me if I was
                                    doing the right thing. I explained that we were checking up to
                                    see how many actually wanted to go, but I feared that the result
                                    would indicate that we would not find it feasible to let any
                                    go.” (Memorandum of conversation, by the Secretary of State,

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Wiggins</persName> said the news organizations could not
                            share in administering policy because that would make them supporters of
                            the policy.</p>

                                <persName>Wiggins</persName> and <persName>Koop</persName> then said
                            their organizations were all on record as opposing any limitation,
                            feeling that American correspondents had the right to go anywhere, and
                            that they could not share in a Government policy of limitation. Mr.
                                <persName>Hurleigh</persName> said his organization was likewise
                            opposed in principle to limitation but it was different from the others
                            in that he was willing to share responsibility in working out a
                            limitation.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned on the need to get further information on the
                            actual demand of American news organizations to send correspondents to
                            China. Mr. <persName>Luce</persName> thought an allocation of 30 would
                            fill all conceivable demands. It was agreed that Mr.
                                <persName>Berding</persName> would make a survey of American news
                            organizations which now have at least one full-time American
                            correspondent stationed overseas, and ask each of them by letter whether
                            it wished to send a full-time American correspondent to Communist China
                            on a regular basis for six months or more.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary dictated the following statement, which Mr.
                                <persName>Berding</persName> made to the press at the close of the

                            in which he made it clear that the “hundred flowers” policy was intended
                            to strengthen the “leading position” of Marxism ideologically and in
                            which he listed six criteria by which word and actions could be judged
                            to be “fragrant flowers” or “poisonous weeds”.</p>
                        <p>The meetings of the National People’s Congress were utilized as a forum
                            in which to expose and attack the offending critics of the regime, and
                            before the Congress closed on July 15 several persons accused of
                            “rightist” activity publicly recanted. Most prominent of these were:
                                <persName>Chang Po-chun</persName>, Minister of Communications;
                                <persName>Lo Lung-chi</persName>, Minister of Timber Industry; and
                                <persName>Lung Yun</persName>, Vice Chairman of the National Defense
                            Council (it was Lung who criticized Soviet “aid” policies). Several
                            others have been denounced, including <persName>Chang
                            Nai-chi</persName>, Minister of Food Industry, and <persName>Tseng
                                Chao-lun</persName>, Vice Minister of Education.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, Moscow, which had hitherto refrained from expressing a
                            definite opinion on these events in Communist China, has put itself on
                            record as lauding <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName>’s campaign
                            against the “rightists” in a “Pravda” editorial of July 16. While
                            avoiding specific mention of <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName>’s
                            doctrine of “contradictions among the people” or his “hundred flowers”
                            policy, the editorial describes the February 27 speech in which these
                            are presented as a “tremendous event in the political life of China” and
                            as developing tenets of “great significance for Marxist-Leninist theory
                            in general”. The carefully worded editorial appears intended to
                            demonstrate maximum identity of view between Moscow and Peiping without
                            specifically endorsing any of <persName corresp="#p_MT1"
                            >Mao</persName>’s theses as being applicable outside of China.</p>
                        <p>Whether the “rightist” critics will be removed from office or otherwise
                            punished is not clear. A “People’s Daily” editorial of July 16 expresses
                            dissatisfaction with the sincerity of some of the confessions but points
                            out that if the offenders truly admit their mistakes and not repeat
                            their misdeeds they may still be rehabilitated. But this same editorial
                            foreshadows possible intensification of the campaign with the
                            observation that a long time and further effort will be required before
                            “complete victory” against the “rightists” is won. The “hundred flowers”
                            appear to be withering rapidly, but it is too early to tell whether they
                            will be forcibly uprooted.</p>

                                    the United States would be during the third 5-year plan
                                    (1962–1967), since the disparity between the two countries in

                        </list>
                        <p>Since the end of June, the Peiping press and radio have reported that
                            “counter-revolutionary” plots have been unearthed by state security
                            organizations in the provinces of Kwangtung, Kwangsi, Hunan, Hupei,
                            Chekiang, Shantung, Szechwan, and Tsinghai. The alleged plots were said
                            to involve conspirators ranging from <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            and Kuomintang agents equipped with the latest scientific espionage
                            equipment to leaders of superstitious secret sects possessing homemade
                            firearms, magic spears, and miraculous talismans. According to the
                            Communists, the conspirators exploited unrest caused by “certain
                            inadequate measures of the government” (as in relocating peasants from a
                            proposed damsite), dissatisfaction with the results of collectivization,
                            and uncertainty caused by the criticism of the regime that arose after
                                <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName>’s February 27 call for
                            wider “blooming and contending” in Communist China. The conspirators are
                            being defined as persons who actually took up or plotted to take up arms
                            against the regime, thus maintaining the distinction between
                            “counter-revolutionaries” and the “rightists” who are being attacked for
                            excessive criticism after <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName>’s
                            speech, but who nonetheless continue to collaborate with the regime in
                            various bureaucratic, academic, and cultural functions.</p>
                        <p>The sum total of the reported incidents—less than two dozen small plots
                            in eight of Communist China’s provinces and major regions—almost <pb
                                n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0609"/>certainly does not give an
                            accurate picture of the scope and seriousness of unrest in Communist
                            China. In the present second successive year of agricultural disaster in
                            Communist China dissidence and unrest are believed to be virtually
                            nationwide. However, the Communist reports probably do accurately
                            reflect the unorganized haphazard nature of the existing dissidence,
                            which appears to be reflected primarily in spontaneous incidents and in
                            the activities of the scattered semi-religious, semi-bandit secret sects
                            that are endemic in China during periods of economic stress.</p>
                        <p>Peiping’s motive in publicizing the incidents is unclear. The Chinese
                            Communists appear to view the propaganda on “counter-revolutionary”
                            plots as an accompaniment to the concurrent and much more prominent
                            propaganda drive against the “rightist” critics of the regime. The
                            regime may be attempting to intimidate the “rightists,” many of whom
                            have not made fully acceptable “confessions,” and other potential
                            opponents of the regime. The uncertain and rather tentative propaganda
                            approach to the subject and the absence so far of a <hi rend="italic"
                                >People’s Daily</hi> editorial defining the “significance” of the
                            publicized incidents may indicate that Peiping is seeking for a new
                            balance between force and persuasion in the aftermath of the Hungarian
                            rebellion, the repercussions of which continue to be evident in
                            Communist China. It seems clear, however, that the present level of
                            dissidence in mainland China represents no serious threat to the
                            regime’s stability or program, particularly since the Chinese Communists
                            have not yet brought their full capability for force and persuasion to
                            bear on the problem.</p>

                        <p>There is every likelihood that the twenty-four full-time resident

                        <p>Over forty Americans who attended the Youth Conference in Moscow are now

                            that a number of these “Youth” representatives have contracted to file
                            stories or pictures in connection with their journey, which, as you
                            know, was undertaken despite the letter addressed to them by the Acting
                                Secretary.<note n="3" xml:id="d277fn3">Telegram 144 to Moscow,
                                August 12, conveyed the text of a letter from the Acting Secretary
                                to be distributed to those Americans attending the Youth Conference
                                who were considering an invitation to visit the People’s Republic of
                                China. The letter outlined the reasons why the Department felt that
                                “it is not consistent with the policy of the United States, as
                                approved by the President, that citizens of the United States travel
                                to the areas of China under Communist control”. The letter warned
                                that if passport restrictions on travel to China were ignored, “at
                                the first possible opportunity your passport will be marked valid
                                only for travel for direct return to the United States and your
                                passport will be taken up when you do so return”. The letter also
                                warned that “travel to and in Communist China at this time may well
                                involve violation of the regulations issued and enforced under the
                                Trading with the Enemy Act, which constitutes a criminal offense
                                under our law”. (Department of State, Central Files, 800.46/8–1257)
                                Despite the warning, the Embassy in Moscow reported in telegram 319
                                on August 14 that 45 Americans had departed from Moscow for China
                                that day. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 800.46/8–1457)</note> If we
                            are to relax our passport policy with respect to correspondents, it
                            would be grossly unfair to have the news organizations which, on the
                            whole, have respected our policy, scooped by these amateur
                            reporters.</p>

                        <p>While I am not opposing this relaxation of our China passport policy, I
                            feel that it must be done in full recognition of the fact that it will
                            become increasingly difficult if not impossible, to continue a
                            restrictive policy on travel by United States citizens to Communist
                            China, regardless of profession or purpose. As you well know, the <pb

                            those of other American citizens. Even if it be recognized that a
                            limitation in numbers is legitimate, it is doubtful whether the press
                            has the legal right to preempt all of the slots.</p>

                        <p>On August 22 the Department of State issued a press release which stated,
                            in part, that the Secretary of State had determined “that it may prove
                            consistent with the foreign policy of the United States that there be
                            travel by a limited number of American news representatives to the
                            mainland of China in order to permit direct reporting by them to the
                            American people about conditions in the area under Chinese Communist
                            control.” Twenty-four newsgathering organizations had indicated an
                            interest in stationing a correspondent in China on a resident basis for
                            6 months or longer. The Department of State accepted “that this number
                            comes within the intent of the Secretary’s determination” and was
                            prepared to issue a passport authorizing travel to mainland China, on an
                            experimental basis, to one correspondent from each of the newsgathering
                            organizations. The passports would be validated for a period of 7 months
                            and the correspondents involved were warned that those traveling to
                            mainland China “do so knowing that they face abnormal personal risks due
                            to the failure of the Chinese Communist regime to treat American
                            citizens in accordance with the accepted code of civilized nations.” The
                            United States would not, it was emphasized, “accord reciprocal visas to
                            Chinese bearing passports issued by the Chinese Communist regime.” The
                            release concluded with the statement that, generally speaking, “it is
                            still not consistent with United States policy, or lawful, that there be
                            travel by Americans to areas of China now under Communist control.” The
                            press release included a list of the 24 organizations authorized to send
                            correspondents to China. (Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                            the United States approach to China was changing, and he anticipated
                            that policy would have to change with it: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Secretary then noted that no one in Congress has supported
                                    our past policy regarding the travel of correspondents to
                                    Communist China. He also suggested the time is approaching when
                                    we must treat Communist China on the same basis we treat the
                                    Soviet Union. We have nearly reached this situation with regard
                                    to trade. Even when the US did not recognize the <gloss

                                    travel to and trade with the Soviet Union. The difference in the
                                    case of Communist China, however, is that American citizens are
                                    being held in prison there and the Communist Chinese regime has
                                    refused to renounce the use of force, particularly with regard

                        <p>On August 26 the People’s Republic of China responded to the United

                            number of American correspondents to travel to China was rejected as
                            “completely unacceptable.” The newspaper charged that the decision had
                            discourteously ignored the principle of reciprocity in ruling out the
                            granting of visas to Chinese correspondents. (The <hi rend="italic"

                                policies of the US. Major setbacks in Communist China or the
                                Communist world would raise Nationalist morale and strength of

                                foster divisive and defeatist tendencies in Taiwan. The death of

                                probably be followed by a period of domestic uncertainties and a
                                weakening of the government’s stability. Communist China’s admission

                            <item>Given continued US support, the National Government will probably
                                maintain its position on Taiwan, although its international position
                                will deteriorate. Continued emphasis on the objective of return to
                                the mainland, however, would increase the need for US aid to prevent
                                economic degeneration, particularly in view of the population growth
                                expected over the next decade. In this situation there would be
                                increased frustration and defeatism, especially among middle level
                                elements, and there might be increased susceptibility to Communist

                                long-term economic development, the island might become economically

                                    <p>“The recently approved <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> on

                                        (Tab A) presents a distorted picture of the present
                                        situation of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and
                                        makes a number of questionable forecasts.</p>
                                    <p>“The most serious of these questionable forecasts is the
                                        allegation in paragraphs 4 and 5 that continued emphasis by
                                        the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on return to the
                                        mainland would lead to economic degeneration and declining
                                        morale, while, if a new generation of leaders were to
                                        ’accept a two-Chinas arrangement,’ this would lead to
                                        economic viability and improved morale. This prediction
                                        ignores the fact that the hope of return to the mainland is
                                        an important element in morale on Taiwan, and is a key part
                                        of the very rationale of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                            >GRC</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                        could not abandon this hope, or acquiesce in a ’two-Chinas’
                                        arrangement, without relinquishing its claim to be the
                                        government of all China, and in fact ceasing to be the

                                        figures in our policy. Such a change could not be made
                                        without very serious consequences. It is a dubious thesis
                                        that final acceptance by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                            >GRC</gloss> of Communist control of mainland China
                                        would lead to improved morale among the mainlanders on
                                        Taiwan or that continuation of economic progress on Taiwan
                                        is contingent on <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                        acquiescence in abandonment of the mainland. State dissented
                                        from this line of reasoning and recommended alternative
                                        wording for paragraphs 5 (reproduced on separate sheet at
                                        front of <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>).</p>
                                    <p>“Another fundamental defect in the paper is an implicit
                                        assumption throughout much of the discussion of future
                                        developments, including long-term trends, that there will be
                                        no political crisis on the mainland of China severe enough
                                        for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to again become
                                        an important factor in mainland developments. Any forecast
                                        extending over a generation, as parts of this one do, should
                                        not reject this possibility.</p>
                                    <p>“The paper also suffers from the absence of clear indication
                                        of the time period to which it is intended to apply. It
                                        shuttles back and forth from short-term to long-term
                                        predictions in a confusing manner.” (Department of State,

                                be misleading. The Republic of China cannot survive without US
                                support. Its position as the legal government of China is being
                                increasingly threatened by Communist China. Its leaders are not
                                satisfied with their prospects on Taiwan and continue to hold to the
                                return to the mainland as a major objective, although many of them

                            <item>Throughout eight years on Taiwan the top Nationalist leadership,
                                and particularly <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                    Kai-shek</persName>, has held firmly to the objective of a
                                return to the mainland as the raison d’etre of the National
                                Government. The Generalissimo is apparently concerned over the
                                long-term pull of the mainland on his followers, and in addition
                                believes that to abandon the objective of return would be a betrayal
                                of his obligations to the people of China now enslaved by a foreign
                                ideology and culture. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>
                                has apparently not given up hope that the return would be realized
                                in his lifetime. His own appraisal of developments of the past year,
                                in the Bloc generally and in Communist China specifically, has
                                almost certainly raised his estimate of the chances of a return. He
                                may well read into current Communist difficulties on the mainland
                                the early signs of that reaction against “alien rule” that his
                                interpretation of Chinese history tells him is inevitable. The
                                Generalissimo’s faith in the return will probably remain even though
                                current troubles on the mainland fail to attain serious proportions
                                and even if there is no apparent prospect of major hostilities
                                between the US and the Chinese Communists. Furthermore, whatever the
                                actual chances of a return, he will almost certainly continue to
                                believe that it is essential to proclaim the objective in order to
                                maintain morale and a sense of national purpose among his
                                followers.</item>

                            <item>However important it may be for Nationalist morale to hold out
                                promise of return, the continued emphasis on this theme in
                                propaganda and policy constitutes a major vulnerability in the
                                Nationalist position on Taiwan, if, as we believe likely, the
                                realistic chances of a return are slim. The problem of finding
                                constructive employment for Taiwan’s large numbers of educated and
                                talented men is becoming increasingly serious. They are not able to
                                utilize fully their talents on Taiwan, and are constantly subject to
                                skillful appeals from the mainland to come home with honor to
                                contribute to the building of “new” China. It is particularly with
                                respect to mainlanders who are middle level officials, younger army
                                officers, white collar workers, and intellectuals that indications
                                of dissatisfaction have been in evidence. This group represents a
                                potentially serious morale problem and a target for Communist

                            <item>The most striking event of the past year was the 24 May riot and
                                the sacking of the US Embassy. We believe this incident did not
                                reflect the existence in Taiwan of intense anti-Americanism, but did
                                demonstrate resentment against what many Chinese believed to be a
                                miscarriage of justice. The reaction was intensified by the
                                existence of deep-seated frustrations and injured national pride.
                                Although some officials probably knew that a demonstration was
                                planned and some advantage was taken of the situation, the pillage
                                of the Embassy was probably not premeditated. There was a long delay
                                in controlling the mob after the demonstrations turned to violence,
                                reflecting seriously on the ability of the government to take prompt

                                maintain its formal international position. The Nationalists gained
                                from the hardening of world opinion toward the Bloc because of
                                recent events in Hungary and the Middle East. Saudi Arabia,
                                Paraguay, and Liberia have agreed to exchange ambassadors with the
                                National Government, and Jordan may soon follow suit. Pressure,
                                however, continues in favor of Communist China’s entry into the

                                self-sustaining. The reorganized National Government has provided a
                                reasonably strong and effective administration under which it has
                                been possible to employ US aid deliveries efficiently. Productive

                                raw materials, much of which was made available through US aid. As a
                                result, the economy has continued to expand during the past year,
                                but at a decelerating rate. Taiwan’s <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                                    >GNP</gloss> in 1957 will be about seven percent higher than in
                                1956, and about 72 percent higher than in 1951. However, the
                                apparent economic progress is seriously overshadowed by the
                                increasing pressure on resources, and inflationary forces continue
                                to grow despite continued large scale US aid. Two basic problems
                                plague the economy of Taiwan. One is the huge military establishment
                                which is made necessary by defense requirements and by the objective
                                of returning to the mainland. The other basic problem is that with
                                limited natural resources the population is increasing at the rate
                                of about three percent per annum, and government and social
                                attitudes are hostile to any measure designed to control population
                                growth.</item>

                                promote some economic development. In the short term, the

                                would undermine morale to a point that might make maintenance of
                                stability by the National Government difficult. The problem would be
                                aggravated by the Government’s reluctance to accept economic reasons

                                strains mentioned above, they would accept the situation and become
                                reconciled to the economic and psychological problems of a Taiwan

                                    >UN</gloss> would be a serious psychological blow to the
                                National Government. In the Nationalist view it would signify world
                                acceptance of Communist victory in China, US unwillingness or
                                inability to prevent this acceptance, and a consequent further
                                weakening of prospects for a Nationalist return. While it would
                                accelerate the forces of deterioration, we believe that for the
                                immediate future there would be no collapse of National Government
                                authority.</item>

                            <item>The long-term staying power of the Republic of China will be
                                determined by the policies of the US, by developments within
                                Communist China, and by the ability of Nationalist leaders to adjust
                                to life on Taiwan. Indications that the US was losing interest in
                                supporting the National Government, and that Communist China was
                                gaining international prestige and internal strength and stability,
                                would accelerate divisive and defeatist tendencies on Taiwan, Major
                                setbacks or persistent terrorism on the mainland would raise
                                Nationalist morale and purpose. Continued emphasis on the objective
                                of return to the mainland would lead to political frustration and
                                would require increasing levels of US support to prevent economic
                                collapse. Conversely, a limiting of political ambitions to the
                                horizons of Taiwan and a concentration on long-term economic
                                development might make the island politically and economically
                                viable, though it would still need some US support.</item>

                                                Government is in its homeland and can accept the
                                                concept of a primarily defensive military
                                                establishment. The Chinese Nationalists are exiles
                                                from their homeland and it is difficult for them to

                                                is considered that such introduction will have no

                                                goal. Attitudes of the Taiwanese toward the

                            phrased as to invite refusal for their admission. At present moment they
                            are most concerned with mechanics of possible applications from
                            Communist China for admission Chinese newspapermen to United States and
                            seem very hopeful that if such mechanics can be overcome United States
                            Government will permit entry of such newspapermen to United States.</p>
                        <p>They seem confused on two matters and have been queried on these by
                            Communist press representative BIQ Hong Kong. The first is some

                            which the Chinese newspapermen would have to meet in order to qualify
                            for entry into United States. With respect to first question have made
                            quite clear to them that reciprocity with respect to group admission to
                            United States impossible under our law and that each application must be
                            passed upon separately. With respect to second have told them that while
                            I was in no position to outline criteria assumed that United States

                            to United States as possible mechanism for breaking log jam. This was
                            off record and I assured him that I could give no official approval such
                            suggestion but personally see no objection this being done on their own
                            responsibility. All of correspondents feel that for propaganda purposes
                            it would be valuable have clearer definition from you on meaning of
                            reciprocity as well as some indication we do not fear what a few Chinese
                            correspondents which might be admitted to United States would report
                            from United States. Apparently correspondents waiting here have been
                            subjected to considerable ribbing by local Communist reporters and are
                            presently in unhappy mood of frustration.</p>

                        <p>I think session was worthwhile but of course could do little to counter
                            attitude of frustration except repeat that burden now on Chinese

                            “In spite of US obstacles” Stevens, Harrington and Worthy came to <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and “completed their press coverage”.
                            In spite of stables [<hi rend="italic">obstacles</hi>?] US youth
                            delegation had also entered <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and were
                            being “warmly welcomed and with an abundance of good will”. “Does not
                            this show that no official ban can prevent Chinese and American peoples
                            from showing their demand for better contacts”. After nearly a year US
                            had on August 22 under great pressure given permission certain number of
                            correspondents visit <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. “In same
                            breath statement in entirely unreasonable terms refused accord
                            reciprocal visas to Chinese newsmen. Subsequent statements have not
                            altered this”. US August 22 statement set tasks for US correspondents in
                                <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and thus ulterior motive and US

                            internal affairs all too clear. None could conceive <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> would accept August 22 statement which
                            disregards reciprocity and equality. <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                            believes exchange visits of correspondents is a practical and concrete
                            step to improving Sino-American relations and therefore proposes agreed
                            announcement. Text meets need for equality and reciprocity.</p>
                        <p>In reply I “found it astounding” that he had “entirely reversed” position
                            he had taken last year when he had stressed <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> was not asking reciprocity for admission
                            correspondents. Also under US laws and regulations impossible to assure
                            reciprocity. Therefore in light these two facts statement reciprocity
                            included August 22 statement. Also found it astounding that he now
                            characterized entry of US correspondents many of whom were same men to
                            whom they had previously extended invitations as undisguised
                            interference their internal affairs. However, if they now desire exclude
                            US correspondents that entirely matter their choice. <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> has not previously raised question of

                            correspondent applied for admission to US. “If any journalist from your
                            country desires to enter the US he is entirely free to make application
                            to any foreign service post for <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0631"
                            />a visa and it will be considered on its merits just the same as any
                            other visa application”. “I am not in a position to enter into any
                            agreement or understanding with you any more than I am with any other
                            government that a full and equal number of correspondents be admitted to
                            the US or that any particular individual will be granted admittance to
                            the US. Neither do we make any such demand from your side. It is
                            entirely up to your own decision as to whether you wish to admit any
                            individual or any number of individuals”. Purport his subsequent
                            statement was that Department’s statement on reciprocity in August 22
                            statement had entirely altered nature of questions and closed door on
                            exchange visits of correspondents. Responsibility lies entirely with
                            US.</p>
                        <p>I reiterated substance para 3 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>
                            244 and said that I expected they would consider application visas
                            accordance their laws and regulation in same manner as US would do and
                            that I would not attempt dictate their action any more than I would
                            accept dictation from them our actions. If they decided refuse visas
                            correspondents could not in any way shift responsibility to US. That was
                            their own decision.</p>

                        <p>Excellent briefing by military staff produced unanimous conclusion from
                                <persName corresp="#p_DVAAK1">Admiral Doyle</persName> other
                            military leaders, namely, that situation Taiwan could not remain
                            stationary and that unless moves were made soon situation would
                            inevitably deteriorate. Specific moves were not discussed although
                            military opinions coincided very closely with briefing given by
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> in Hawaii.
                            Second definite conclusion by staff was that our own policy to
                            differentiate with respect protection Formosa and off-shore islands no
                            longer valid. Government of Taiwan completely committed to protecting
                            off-shore islands up to point where every available man and ship would
                            be mobilized to protect islands leaving Taiwan completely unprotected in
                            event attack on these islands. Accordingly defense of islands would be
                            essential to defense of Taiwan.</p>

                        <p>“The President explained that he had requested the interview because he
                            hoped that the Under Secretary would carry with him to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and to President

                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and the US should do about it.
                            It was his intention to leave discussion of details to subsequent
                            conversations with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RKL1"
                                >Rankin</persName> but he hoped briefly to present a general
                            summary.</p>
                        <p>“The President noted that since May of this year there had been a decided
                            turn of events on the China mainland. He thought these developments were
                            very significant and it was important that we take due note of them.</p>
                        <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> recalled that

                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, expressing the
                            hope that the President, on the threshold of his second term, would be
                            able to pay particular attention to the <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605"
                                facs="0633"/>problem of liberation of the “captive peoples” of the
                            world and that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> would prove to be a “Lincoln” to the captive
                            peoples of Asia. He had pointed out the deteriorating situation on the
                            mainland. He had said it was his view that a “Hungary situation” might
                            well develop on the mainland but would be on a much larger scale than in
                            Hungary.</p>
                        <p>“He had later received a personal reply<note n="5" xml:id="d284fn5">See
                                    <ref target="#d227">Document 227</ref>.</note> from President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, in which the
                            President had taken note of the changes taking place inside the Soviet
                            and the Communist world in general which indicated a tendency toward
                            uprisings against Communist regimes. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had noted that once these
                            movements gained a foothold it would be difficult for the Communist
                            world. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had
                            said that he thought military measures were not appropriate at that time
                            but had suggested that other means of pressure should be brought by the
                            free world on the Communist world.</p>
                        <p>“Since last autumn, President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName> continued, anti-Communist movements have
                            developed in Sinkiang, Tibet, and Mongolia. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> had kept vigilant watch over these developments but the
                            rest of the world had paid little attention. Now, since May, these
                            anti-Communist movements had become almost faits accomplis and had
                            forced the Communists to take drastic action.</p>
                        <p>“The ‘100 flowers’ and the ‘rectification’ programs were results of these
                            developments. The US should now reappraise its China policy and should
                            take account particularly of the psychological aspect, since these
                            captive peoples look upon the US as the leader of the free world and as
                            their ultimate liberator. He hoped the US realized the opportunities
                            which now present themselves, however challenging they may be, and
                            appreciated the serious repercussions for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> and the US if we let this movement die down.</p>
                        <p>“The Under Secretary remarked that he was not quite clear whether the
                            President thought the degree of discontent and unrest has now reached a
                            peak from which it was likely to recede in the future.</p>
                        <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> replied that
                            there was no question that the opposition to the Communist regime on the
                            mainland was very widespread. In fact, it was ubiquitous and was not
                            confined to the schools and the intellectuals but had spread to the farm
                            cooperatives, the labor unions and even inside the Communist party
                            itself. It was difficult to say whether a peak had been reached but it
                            was certain that if no demonstration came from the countries outside the
                            Communist world and if no assistance were given by them, then the
                            movement would die out. However, if the people were given to understand
                            that the free world stands by them, it would be an entirely <pb n="606"
                                xml:id="pg_606" facs="0634"/>different matter. The President
                            remarked that he was convinced the Communist press was reflecting only a
                            small portion of the actual unrest.</p>
                        <p>“The President said he was fully aware that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> and the US have a mutual defense treaty supplemented by
                            an exchange of notes regarding the use of force. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> did not want to do anything to violate
                            the understandings which had been reached between the two governments
                            and would not undertake large-scale military action without consulting
                            the US. Obviously, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would need
                            the full backing of the US if it were to undertake such action. However,
                            it is vital that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> maintain its
                            standing with regard to the captive peoples. The people behind the
                            Communist curtain understand that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> cannot mount a large invasion, but if the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> does nothing by other means to take
                            advantage of the present state of affairs, then the people behind the
                            bamboo curtain, the overseas Chinese, and the world in general would
                            lose confidence in the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and respect
                            for it. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> stressed
                            that unless the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> were to give some
                            help, some ‘ultra mural’ assistance then the position of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, and of the US as well, would be
                            threatened, since the peoples on both sides of the curtain would lose
                            confidence in them.</p>
                        <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> said he had never
                            been fooled by Communist propaganda. By far the great majority of the
                            people on the mainland are still friendly toward the US, more friendly
                            indeed than to any other Western country. They regard the US as the only
                            country which can ’bail them out’ and can help them. But if the US takes
                            no action (he said he had in mind ’indirect’ action), then he feared
                            that the overseas Chinese and the 10 million Chinese on Taiwan, as well
                            as those behind the curtain, would inevitably lose confidence in the
                            US.</p>
                        <p>“In reply to a question by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJP1"
                                >Richards</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName> summed up his view as follows: The US and the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should take a more aggressive
                            attitude toward the mainland, even if this were short of actual
                            invasion.</p>
                        <p>“The President remarked that while he did not wish at the moment to go
                            into details, he nevertheless had some specific ideas. In fact, toward

                            as early as last year he had been predicting the present unrest on the
                            China mainland and had worked out a plan of action.</p>
                        <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> hoped very much
                            that the US would agree in principle to study the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>’s plans, and to support them, for
                            organizing <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0635"/>guerrilla action on
                            the mainland and for means which would tend to organize the resistance
                            there. The Under Secretary asked whether the President, in expressing
                            this hope, was speaking of the paratrooper plan or of a more general
                            course of action.</p>
                        <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> replied that the
                            paratrooper plan, which he had discussed with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName>, was a preliminary step in the
                            direction he intended. That plan was essential but was only a start.</p>
                        <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> commented that he
                            knew the US Government has worldwide commitments and that its attention
                            was, thus, diffused. He therefore thought that perhaps the present
                            situation on the mainland was not fully appreciated in Washington. It
                            was for this reason that he took the present opportunity to have this
                            message carried personally to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>. He hoped that Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> would feel, in carrying the
                            message to Washington, that he was performing an act of humanity on
                            behalf of the millions of captive peoples.</p>
                        <p>“The Under Secretary assured the President on behalf of himself and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName> that the
                            message would be fully conveyed.</p>
                        <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> said that as a
                            first step in implementing his policy he had produced the plan of last
                            December and still hoped that consideration could be given the plan,
                            which was not ambitious and was within the capabilities of the US and
                            the manpower resources of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. The
                            President remarked that he realized that in the normal administrative
                            handling of affairs of state, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> would probably not have an opportunity to
                            read his plan. He was therefore calling Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s attention to it and hoped that
                            speedy consideration could be given it and that the details could be
                            discussed between the experts of the two nations.</p>
                        <p>“Madam <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> pointed out that the
                            plan, while modest, provides an essential beginning.</p>
                        <p>“Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> commented
                            that he thought President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>
                            was too modest and that he felt certain the plan would receive the
                            personal attention of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>.</p>
                        <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> expressed his
                            regrets that typhoons necessitated an earlier departure from Taipei than
                            the Under Secretary’s party had originally expected. The Under Secretary
                            expressed great appreciation for the President’s time and courtesy. He
                            said he would be in touch with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RKL1"
                                >Rankin</persName> and that President <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiang</persName>’s plan would be given prompt consideration.”</p>

                        <p>In view of the length of his briefing of the Council on this subject at
                            last week’s Council meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName>’s briefing note (which is included in the minutes
                            of the meeting) was somewhat shorter in length. He also pointed out that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had requested a
                            delay in the Council action last week in order to ascertain the opinions
                            of Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">James P. Richards</persName>, Special
                            Assistant to the President. He then called on Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Alluding to the fact that Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                                >Herter</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJP1"
                                >Richards</persName> had recently been in the Far East, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the State
                            Department had asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName>
                            in particular to study the <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0640"
                            />situation on Taiwan in order to get a fresh appraisal of the
                            effectiveness of our policies there. Accordingly, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked if Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> might speak first and give his
                            impressions, after which he, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, would like to make further comments.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> indicated that
                            he had stayed over on Taiwan for a longer period than Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>, in order to look more
                            thoroughly into the situation on the island. From all the evidence that
                            he, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName>, could find, he
                            had come to the conclusion that it would be disastrous now to change our
                            present policy with respect to Taiwan, though he said he did not know
                            the precise limitations with respect to available appropriations for
                            carrying out our policy in Taiwan. If, because of such limitations, any
                            reductions have to be made in our assistance to Taiwan, such reductions
                            should be made in a world-wide context and in terms of the Congressional
                            Resolution (Public Law 4,<note n="3" xml:id="d287fn3">See <ref
                                    target="frus1955-57v02#d56">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>,
                                    Document 56</ref>.</note> 84th Congress). The Nationalists,
                            continued Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName>, had urged
                            on him the view that discontent in mainland China might offer the
                            opportunity for armed intervention by the Nationalists at some future
                            time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> thought that
                            we should take this view into account, as well as taking heed of the
                            general situation in the Far East. Again he said it would be disastrous
                            everywhere else in free Asia, and particularly in Southeast Asia, if the
                            United States drastically changed its policies in Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>Whether in fact the Generalissimo will ever be able to return to the
                            mainland was certainly a question. Nevertheless, if there was even one
                            chance in ten of his successfully doing this, the United States should
                            be in a position to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName>’
                            comments, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> spoke
                            again. He first stated that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                                >Herter</persName> had asked him to report to the Council that he
                            was fully in accord with the view that we should not change the missions
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> armed forces on Taiwan.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> continued that
                            it was his own view that it would be a major disaster to our whole
                            position in the Far East if we did change these missions. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said it was not for
                            him to state that we must agree to maintain certain <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> force levels, but certainly we should
                            not change the missions of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> armed
                            forces. Particularly, we should not change these missions by cutting out
                            reference to the possibility of a Nationalist return to mainland China.
                            It was indeed only this hope of a return to mainland China that sustains
                            morale on Taiwan, even if the hope was remote.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then pointed out
                            that the general situation from the U.S. point of view is quite
                            different in Asia than in Europe. The Western European countries are
                            much more solid in depth and strength, both militarily and otherwise. In
                            Asia, on the other hand, <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0641"/>only a
                            series of small island and peninsula positions separate the United
                            States from Communist positions in depth on the continent of Asia. The
                            reason these small island and peninsula countries maintain their will to
                            freedom is because of their hope that Communist China will one day blow
                            up. Nor was this to be thought altogether a forlorn hope, as Hu Shih had
                            recently pointed out in his address before the United Nations. What had
                            happened in Hungary and Poland could conceivably happen in Communist
                            China. If a blow-up occurred, Chinese Nationalist troops might find the
                            great opportunity which they had been seeking. While we can all have our
                            own views as to the likelihood that such things will come to pass, the
                            fact remained that the Chinese Nationalists believe that this chance may
                            be offered, and it is precisely this belief that sustains them in their
                            resistance to Communism. If, by changing our policies, we destroy that
                            Chinese Nationalist hope, we will at the same time destroy the capacity
                            of the Chinese Nationalists for the defense of Taiwan itself. Beyond
                            this, such a change in our policy would mean the abandoning of our whole
                            Far Eastern position.</p>
                        <p>The President said that this was beginning to sound a little academic to
                            him. Were we talking about reducing the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> force levels on Taiwan?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> undertook to
                            explain to the President what the issues were. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> followed with a fuller
                            explanation, in terms of the past history of our policies toward Taiwan.
                            He cited paragraph 3 of existing U.S. policy toward Formosa, which set
                            forth the missions of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> armed
                            forces as follows:<note n="4" xml:id="d287fn4">The following is

                        <p rend="flushleft">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then
                            explained that the difference in interpretation of this paragraph
                            derived from disagreement as to whether the contribution of the <gloss

                            by-products of the first two missions of assisting in the defense of

                            >GRC</gloss>-held off-shore islands.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that this was not what he was asking about. Here in
                            the Council we were writing a policy for ourselves, <pb n="614"
                                xml:id="pg_614" facs="0642"/>and we do not have any obligation to
                            tell all about it to <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName>. What the President said he was after was the
                            actual effect of our language, because he emphatically agreed with the
                            State Department on the danger of destroying Nationalist hopes of an
                            ultimate return to the mainland. This, of course, did not mean that we
                            were obliged to tell the Chinese Nationalists everything else that we
                            have in our mind about them.</p>
                        <p>At this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            broke in to state that this was precisely the intention of the sentence
                            proposed by the Bureau of the Budget in the proposed revision of
                            paragraph 17 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5503, where it is
                            suggested that we “make clear to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            that—except in the event of substantial change in the world situation or
                            of conditions on the mainland of China—our future military and economic
                            assistance programs will not be premised on the assumption of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>’s return to power on the mainland.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> explained the basis for
                            the Budget’s point of view as expressed above, and also called attention
                            to the argument of the State Department representative on the Planning
                            Board that we are already telling the Chinese Nationalists what the
                            Budget proposes that we tell them in the Budget revision of paragraph
                            17.</p>
                        <p>Speaking with emphasis, the President said he heartily disagreed with the
                            revision of paragraph 17 proposed by the Bureau of the Budget. Only the
                            hope of ultimately returning to mainland China sustains the morale of
                            the Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan. The President added that of course
                            this did not mean that we now propose to send them masses of military
                            matériel for their use in an invasion of the Chinese mainland.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he had
                            a point of view somewhat different from that of the President. While he
                            understood the basis of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>’ feelings, and had not seen the Generalissimo for
                            some two years, he did believe that if we were realistic we should
                            continue to budget our assistance to the Chinese National Government on
                            about present levels, or even to cut these levels down somewhat in a
                            quiet way. Not only were <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>
                            and his soldiers growing old; the day was coming soon when we were going
                            to have to reapportion all our resources available for foreign
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>The President said that it seemed to him that as the island becomes
                            populated more and more by native Taiwanese and less and less by
                            mainland Chinese, the interest in returning to the Chinese mainland
                            would proportionately lessen. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> replied to the President by pointing out that it
                            was much more basic that if all hope of a Nationalist return to the
                            mainland were to be destroyed the United States would lose the whole
                            show in the Far East. We simply could not afford to permit the Chinese
                            Nationalists to think <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0643"/>we
                            believe that a Communist China was a permanent feature of history.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> for the factual basis
                            of the view he had just expressed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> replied that his view was based on the best
                            judgment of our qualified political observers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then stated that
                            inasmuch as we had heard so much from the proponents of the broader
                            interpretation of the missions of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> armed forces, it would be perhaps apropos to hear from
                            Mr. <persName>Brundage</persName> on the narrower interpretation of
                            these missions, which would confine them to the defense of Taiwan, the
                            Penghus, and the off-shore islands, and stating that any other mission
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces was merely a
                            by-product of these two missions and not a separate and distinct mission
                            justifying additional build-up of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Brundage</persName> began by stating that representatives
                            of the Bureau of the Budget who had made trips to Taiwan were convinced
                            that <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> was seeking
                            more military power in order to launch a counteroffensive against the
                            Chinese Communist mainland. Essentially, therefore, what the Budget was
                            seeking was to guard against a further U.S. build-up of existing <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces rather than a reduction in
                            existing levels. Of course, he added, the Budget Bureau would accept the
                            judgment of the President and the Secretary of State in this matter, but
                            he repeated that the proposed Budget version of paragraph 17 of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5503 was designed to prevent
                            enhancement of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> armed forces
                            rather than to suggest a retrenchment.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we were, of course, talking in this instance
                            about a possible future emergency development in the shape of a
                            Nationalist counteroffensive against the mainland. If such a thing
                            eventuated, the United States must be prepared to rush amphibious
                            equipment to the Nationalists. However, it did not mean that we now
                            contemplated building up the Chinese Nationalists with a lot of military
                            matériel designed for offensive action. We should provide <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> with a limited
                            capability in terms of amphibious equipment, but we should concentrate
                            our assistance on the provision of defensive equipment. So we will be
                            well-advised to talk about cases and facts in terms of actual equipment
                            rather than in terms of missions. The President reaffirmed that he was
                            dead set against the revision of paragraph 17 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5503 proposed by the Bureau of the Budget.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> cited the figures which
                            indicated costly programming and heavy U.S. expenditure for Taiwan over
                            the three years through fiscal 1960, and the very considerable
                            maintenance costs after that year. This certainly seemed to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> to involve the question
                            of a modest cut in these programs and expenditures.</p>
                        <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0644"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> cautioned against
                            moving too fast in making such cuts, for this would be bound to get us
                            into trouble. Nevertheless, over the long haul we are leaning on a
                            pretty weak reed in the shape of the Chinese National Government.</p>
                        <p>The President emphasized that in this context our main purpose was to
                            maintain our hold on the off-shore island chain. It was in order to do
                            this that we must let <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> believe that he may ultimately succeed in
                            getting back to the mainland. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> said he doubted whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> really believed that he could
                            ever stage a successful return to the mainland, and that his repeated
                            allusions to the possibility were largely a matter of saving face.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that he
                            agreed with the President that we could not say to the Generalissimo
                            that his hope of returning to the mainland was a forlorn hope, but we
                            should supply as little matériel as possible to sustain this hope.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that
                            there had been a very great improvement in economic conditions on Taiwan
                            in recent years and months. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName> pointed out, however, that in the attachment to
                            Annex B of the Planning Board paper,<note n="5" xml:id="d287fn5">The
                                Planning Board paper is printed as an enclosure to <ref

                                Problems and Program in Taiwan,” is not printed.</note> the Treasury
                            Department member of the Planning Board had expressed considerable doubt
                            as to the State Department’s contention with respect to economic
                            progress in Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> said he doubted
                            whether anyone in Southeast Asia seriously believed that the
                            Generalissimo would ever successfully return to mainland China, but he
                            believed that the Generalissimo himself was genuinely sincere in his own
                            belief that he would. What particularly bothers the Generalissimo is the
                            sense of frustration now current on Taiwan. Accordingly, if the United
                            States now acts further to destroy the hope of a return to the mainland,
                            the effect will be to increase this sense of frustration. It was in this
                            context that <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> had
                            asked him to tell the President of his hope for assistance in the
                            training of Chinese Nationalist paratroopers. Such training would
                            constitute visible proof that the United States had not given up hope of
                            an eventual return of the Nationalists to the Chinese mainland.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> apparently had in mind
                            a force of some 5000 paratroopers. This was, of course, a matter for the
                            President and the Secretary of State to decide, but in any case Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> counselled that we
                            avoid doing anything to increase the sense of frustration now widespread
                            in Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> commented that
                            the problem could perhaps be solved by providing the Generalissimo with
                            a few paratroopers and reducing the size of other units.</p>
                        <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0645"/>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> summed up
                            what he believed to be the Council’s consensus with respect to
                            paragraphs 3 and 13 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5503, where
                            the views of the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff seemed
                            to have prevailed. He then said that he would take up two other proposed
                            revisions in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5503, which he believed
                            were non-controversial in character. The first of these was concerned
                            with paragraph 10 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5503, which Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> read as follows: <quote

                                    positions of Formosa and the Pescadores.”</p></quote></p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, however, did not
                            regard the matter as non-controversial, and said he would rather have
                            this paragraph follow Public Law 4 verbatim, because the statement of
                            intention set forth in the text of Public Law 4 was more authoritative
                            than the President’s statement to the Congress<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d287fn6">See <ref target="frus1955-57v02#d34">vol. <hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, Document 34</ref>.</note> as to
                            how he would administer Public Law 4. There was no reason needlessly to
                            curtail the President’s authority, and there was much in the legislative
                            history of Public Law 4 to justify his argument.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he couldn’t see that this particular argument was
                            of much substance. The statements in Public Law 4 and his own statement
                            as to how this would be administered, amounted, as far as he could see,
                            to very much the same thing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName> then suggested that the text of the revised
                            paragraph 10 follow the text of Public Law 4, but that there should be
                            added a footnote which would cite the President’s statement as to how he
                            would apply his authority under Public Law 4.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then observed
                            that it seemed to him that the defense of all of the off-shore islands
                            was now so complete and so integral a part of the defense of Taiwan,
                            that it was not to be compared with the fluid situation of three years
                            ago. Certainly as conditions existed today, said Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, he would say that if there were
                            an all-out attack on Quemoy or the Matsus, the United States should not
                            sit to one side and permit the loss of these islands, because their loss
                            would surely result in the loss of Taiwan and the Penghus. It was for
                            this reason that he preferred the broader language of Public Law 4.</p>

                        <p>Pursuant to your instructions, I conducted certain investigations in
                            Taiwan during the course of the recent <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                                >Herter</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName>
                            Mission to the Far East. The following is a brief summary of impressions
                            gained and conclusions arrived at there. (No attempt is made here to go
                            into the details of conversations with individuals.)</p>
                        <p>The Mission arrived in Taiwan on September 12, 1957. The Under-Secretary
                            and I paid courtesy calls on the President, the Vice President, and the
                            Foreign Minister. We attended and enjoyed the formal military,
                            political, and economic briefings by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName>, the Embassy Staff Officers, and
                            other U.S. representatives on Taiwan, civilian and military.</p>
                        <p>We also had dinner with the President and his wife, and on the next day,
                            visited the President to say good-bye and engaged in a general
                            discussion of the problems of Taiwan. The President indicated to us that
                            he was gravely concerned about the problem of keeping up morale on the
                            Island. He informed us that he had presented to the President of the
                            United States, through channels, a plan to train several thousand
                            paratroopers in order to promote better morale and to have them ready
                            when the opportunity comes to invade the Mainland. We made no
                            suggestions to the President nor did we criticize either his plans or
                            conditions on the Island.</p>
                        <p>Our entire party had planned to remain in Taipei from September 12 to 15.
                            The Under-Secretary and I agreed that I would stay over a few days
                            longer, in line with your suggestions. Since a typhoon was approaching,
                            the Commander of our aircraft felt that for the safety of the plane, and
                            to assure that engagements in Okinawa and Korea could be met, the plane
                            should leave the Island on September 14 instead of the 15th.
                            Accordingly, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and the
                            rest of the party left on September 14. I remained in Taipei until
                            September 17 and joined the party later in Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>During my prolonged stay on Taiwan, I primarily sought information on two
                            general subjects: <list>

                        <p>I did not consult further with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RKL1"
                                >Rankin</persName> or his Staff as we had been more or less fully
                            briefed by them on both subjects in a formal meeting. There had seemed
                            to be a disposition on the part of the Ambassador to shrug off the riot
                            as just “one of those things” that might happen anywhere. He seemed to
                            agree with the position of the President no matter what it happened to
                            be.</p>

                        <p>I also had prolonged conversations with <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >George K. C. Yeh</persName>, Minister of Foreign Affairs, who
                            telephoned after the Under-Secretary had left, when he heard that I was
                            staying over. He asked that I go to his office for an informal talk.
                            Shortly thereafter, he telephoned to say that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> had asked if I would go
                            to the President’s home again that afternoon for an informal and frank
                            talk. This I did. (Madame <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> and Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> were also present during this discussion.)</p>
                        <p>The President and I had a very full and frank discussion which lasted
                            about two hours. Then, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> went back to my hotel with me where we had dinner
                            together, and talked an additional three or four hours.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">1. The Nature and Cause of he Taipei
                                Riot</hi></p>
                        <p>It is, of course, generally conceded that the immediate cause of the riot
                            was the <persName>Reynolds</persName> Case. I shall not attempt to deal
                            with the conduct of our Embassy Staff during the riot, since that was
                            dealt with fully by State Department Inspectors, who filed voluminous
                            reports on the subject. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RKL1"
                                >Rankin</persName> was in Hong Kong at the time, without permission
                            (although I understand that he had, at a much earlier date, requested
                            blanket permission to visit Hong Kong).</p>
                        <p>It was evident from the inspection report<note n="2" xml:id="d289fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> that no definite plan had been worked out in advance
                            by our Embassy Staff to meet such an emergency. I am sure the
                            inspectors’ report, which I have read, reveals where the fault lay. In
                            my talks with different officials and individuals, I indicated that my
                            chief concern was not what caused the riot, but why it was not stopped
                            before reaching its destructive <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0654"
                            />peak. As it happened, the President, Vice President, and the Minister
                            of Defense were all out of the city when the trouble began. All
                            informants agreed that immediately prior to the riots, a very bitter
                            anti-American campaign had been conducted in the press of the city, even
                            though, admittedly, the press is controlled by the State. The evidence
                            revealed that there was no real determination exhibited by either the
                            police or the military to stop the riot. On the day of the riot, the
                            press even carried a very bitter denunciation of the verdict rendered in
                            the <persName>Reynolds</persName> Case by the Minister of Justice.</p>
                        <p>I was informed that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has pictures
                            showing that the police made no real effort to control the mob either at
                            the Embassy or at the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> office. When
                            I asked the Foreign Minister why someone was not instructed to shoot if
                            necessary to break up the mob, he said there was no one with authority
                            to issue the order, that all day he tried to get something like that
                            done, but the reply always came back that there was no authority to
                            shoot unless it came from the President himself. I was assured that such
                            a riot could not happen again and that everything was fixed to prevent
                            it, but could not find where the President had placed, even today, the
                            authority to handle such situations in any individual in command of any
                            body of police or troops.</p>
                        <p>The whole thing pointed up the fact that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> delegates no authority
                            to handle situations like the one mentioned. I do not think that this
                            fault has been corrected even now. In my conversations with the
                            President, I explained to him that he could readily understand that the
                            Congress and the people of the United States were much concerned over
                            the incident and, as yet, could not understand why strong steps had not
                            been taken to prevent the incident.</p>
                        <p>The President’s only reply was that he took responsibility for the
                            outrage and was sorry, and assured me that a similar outrage would not
                            and could not happen again. He did not say that he had delegated any
                            Officer or member of his Government to act in his stead, if he himself
                            was not available, to meet such situations.</p>
                        <p>I informed the President that it was widely reported in the United States
                            that members of the Youth Corps (which is commanded by his son,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCLG1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>) were
                            active in inciting the riot and the destruction of our Embassy and the
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> Office. He refused to comment
                            on this.</p>
                        <p>Our military people seemed to feel that the riot was just “one of those
                            things”, which could have been prevented by one company of troops with
                            orders to shoot.</p>
                        <p>I also had talks with a number of Chinese civilians, who were naturally
                            hesitant to express definite opinions. They indicated, however, that
                            frustration was making inroads on morale. They further indicated <pb
                                n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0655"/>that the police could have
                            easily stopped the riot had they received proper instructions from
                            above. There seemed to be a feeling that <persName corresp="#p_CCLG1"
                                >Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> and his Youth Corps knew, beforehand,
                            about an organized protest before our Embassy on the date mentioned.
                            There was no feeling, however, that <persName corresp="#p_CCLG1">Chiang
                                Ching-kuo</persName> anticipated that the Embassy would actually be
                            attacked.</p>

                                from a Morale and Defense Standpoint</hi></p>
                        <p>It is evident that the general morale of Government officials, soldiers,
                            and the people of the Island, generally, is not as high as it was when I
                            was there about three years ago. At that time, training plans were at
                            their peak and there was more zip to all activities. Now there seems to
                            be a mild sense of frustration growing out of the doubts of many Chinese
                            that there is any real chance of returning to the Mainland. I do not
                            feel, however, that this “sense” has reached anything like a danger
                            point internally. The President still has his hands firmly on the reins
                            of Government—a “one-man” Government.</p>
                        <p>The President spoke feelingly of his problems and admitted his concern
                            over the possible growth of the spirit of frustration. The President
                            said that there are many evidences of dissatisfaction on the Mainland
                            and that he must be ready to seize the opportunity to return to the
                            Mainland when it comes. To this end, he informed me that he had
                            presented a plan to the United States for the organization of a
                            paratrooper corps for this purpose. He said that this group could be
                            used either for infiltration and propaganda purposes, or as a spearhead
                            military group for invasion when the time comes.</p>
                        <p>He said that in case of attack on the off-shore islands, he would move
                            his entire military force there. It was evident that, if such a
                            situation arises, he expects the United States to defend Taiwan
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>He felt that such an organization would be worthwhile from two
                            standpoints: (a) to strengthen his military forces; and (b) from the
                            standpoint of building morale of the troops and the people generally on
                            the Island. The President indicated that he had his doubts that our
                            military representatives there were enthusiastic about the plan and
                            expressed the hope that I would convey his proposal to the Secretary of
                            State and the President of the United States, which I promised to
                            do.</p>

                            did seem to think that the training of a smaller group, say 5,000 men,
                            might be well worthwhile from the standpoint of military interests and
                            Chinese morale.</p>

                                Ching-kuo</persName>. In reply to my question as to who would take
                            charge in the event of the President’s death, the predominant impression
                            was that the Vice President would win even though there is contest with
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCLG1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>. One or two
                            felt that <persName corresp="#p_CCLG1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> would
                            have the advantage due to the fact that he has a close grip on the
                            Chinese army officers, plus the Youth Corps which he organized. There
                            seemed to be some doubt about the loyalty of <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCLG1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> but no one said to me
                            that he was an indoctrinated Communist and would lean to the Communist
                            cause in the event of his father’s death. However, both the Foreign
                            Minister and the Chinese individuals with whom I talked felt that it
                            would be good for both <persName corresp="#p_CCLG1">Chiang
                                Ching-kuo</persName> and the morale of the Island for him to be
                            invited to the United States for studies covering as much as one year.
                            One Chinese friend informed me that he should be brought to the U.S. and
                            thoroughly “brain washed” while over here. By that he means that he
                            should have a thorough course in democratic institutions.</p>
                        <p>There seems to be no serious trouble brewing between the Taiwanese and
                            the Chinese who went there from the Mainland, though I did receive
                            reports that the Taiwanese in the Army were dissatisfied because there
                            was no opportunity for advancement in rank for them. I was informed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCLG1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>, the
                            President’s son, kept complete reign on the Officer appointment and
                            promotion system and showed partiality to the Chinese. It was indicated
                            to me that <persName corresp="#p_CCLG1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> did
                            not feel that he could trust the Taiwanese completely in an emergency.
                            I, myself, could gather no definite evidence that this was true.</p>

                                            definite improvement in morale over the past year,

                            make own decisions this matter which I picked up to reply that then
                            there is apparently no problem, no Chinese correspondents having applied
                            to go to U.S., apparently none desire to do so. Pointed out American
                            correspondents travel to most countries of world including Communist
                            countries and correspondents from most <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631"

                            agreements between governments. If any of those governments asked

                                    deportation to Communist China. If we were to make a continuing
                                    operation of extending the terms of the Agreed Announcement to
                                    Chinese aliens regardless of his date of sentence, we might get
                                    into a situation where any Chinese would have carte blanche to
                                    commit any crime in the book. Or so it might seem to Justice and
                                    to the various State authorities. At the same time, I feel we
                                    should not be deprived of our flexibility in this regard, and
                                    for that reason I recommended that we not state our position to

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s original offer in

                            decided at that time, chiefly because of the excessively belligerent
                            actions and attitude of the Chinese Communists, not to authorize travel
                            by relatives (Tab B<note n="4" xml:id="d294fn4">A copy of Department of

                            invitation and, in a letter from the Chinese Communist Red Cross on May
                            7, 1956 (Tab C<note n="5" xml:id="d294fn5">Not printed.</note>) to the

                            applied to the relatives of all imprisoned Americans.</p>
                        <p>The immediate threat of Chinese Communist military action which
                            influenced our decision in January, 1955 has somewhat diminished
                            although the basic considerations against permitting general travel of
                            Americans to Communist China remain unchanged. Nevertheless, there are
                            cogent arguments in favor of withdrawing objection to relatives making
                            the trip. There are only four prisoners whose relatives might be
                            inclined to go, the other two being Catholic priests under five year
                            sentences which will presumably be up in June, 1958. <pb n="636"
                                xml:id="pg_636" facs="0664"/>(See attached list Tab D<note n="6"

                                the names of the six remaining Americans imprisoned in
                            China.</note>). These four are under long-term sentences and there is no
                            reason on the basis of recent Chinese Communist behavior to anticipate
                            their early releases. It is conceivable that the Peiping authorities
                            might take advantage of a visit by relatives to release one or more of
                            these prisoners, although this prospect cannot be considered likely.
                            However, it seems most unlikely that a visit by relatives at this point
                            would damage the prospects of the prisoners for release and withdrawal
                            of United States Government objection to such visits would serve to
                            demonstrate to the relatives and others that the government had taken
                            every possible step to promote release of the prisoners.</p>
                        <p>There are obvious risks in this change of policy. It would mean another
                            breach in our prohibition of American travel to Communist China and,

                            travel there, it would probably be interpreted in some quarters as the
                            beginning of a softening in our policy. However, in view of the very
                            special circumstances of relatives of prisoners it should be possible to
                            hold the line against any further exceptions.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the Chinese Communists would demand a concession from
                            the United States in exchange for permitting entry of the relatives,
                            such as requiring intergovernmental arrangements to be made for the
                            visits or attempting to equate ordinary Chinese convicts in this country
                            with the American prisoners by demanding reciprocal rights for visits by
                            relatives of such Chinese convicts. However, I believe we could handle
                            any such demands so as to cause them to work to the Chinese Communist
                            propaganda disadvantage.</p>

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yen</persName> opened the
                            conversation by presenting a table<note n="2" xml:id="d295fn2">Not found
                                in Department of State files.</note> showing the increase in Taiwan
                            national income from 1951 projected through 1958 and the declining ratio
                            of economic aid to national income. He drew particular attention to the
                            decline in this ratio from 13.4 in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1957 to 7.7 in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> commented that these
                            figures showed how successful the aid program had been in Taiwan. It had
                            never been intended that United States aid should remain indefinitely at
                            a constant ratio with national income. On the contrary, it was intended
                            to make the recipient country more self-supporting so that aid could
                            gradually be reduced. He also pointed out that the figure given for
                            Defense Support for fiscal year 1957 took no account of the Development
                            Loan Fund. Loans from this fund would not be made in accordance with
                            usual banking criteria such as employed by the Export-Import Bank or the
                                <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, but were intended to support
                            projects of the type formerly financed from Defense Support funds. He
                            emphasized that the reduction in the aid program was not limited to
                            Taiwan. Congress had cut one billion dollars from the global figure
                            requested. We were having a very difficult time allocating the funds
                            available among the various countries, all of which needed aid.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yen</persName> replied that he
                            realized the difficulties under which we were operating this year, and
                            he had not come to request the impossible but primarily to enlist Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s support in
                            obtaining from the Development Loan Fund and the <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                >PL</gloss> 480 program enough to satisfy normal requirements of the
                            Taiwan economy. He indicated that although his Government was asking for
                            $20 million of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 commodities, they
                            would be satisfied if they could get the 7.5 million dollars’ worth
                            which would be necessary to supply normal consumption. This consisted of
                            wheat 3.5 million, cotton 1.3 million, tallow 1 million, vegetable oil
                            1.7 million. Since the United States Department <pb n="638"
                                xml:id="pg_638" facs="0666"/>of Agriculture was not disposed to
                            release <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 commodities to satisfy
                            normal consumption abroad, it would be necessary for the Department of
                            State and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> to support strongly the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> request in the <gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 interdepartmental committee to obtain
                            approval of the 7.5 million. <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> was
                            cognizant of and sympathetic with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss>’s desires.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> mentioned that
                            cotton supply was very tight and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PGE1"
                                >Palmer</persName> explained that there are two limitations: one,
                            the monetary ceiling placed by Congress on the <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                >PL</gloss> 480 program, and the other, the amount of surplus cotton
                            available. The demand far exceeded the supply, which made allocation
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yen</persName> explained that the
                            reason he had come to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> and the reason his government was uneasy
                            concerning the prospect for <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480
                            commodities was that the matter had been under consideration for three
                            months, but no decision had yet been reached. His government had sent a
                            special representative here to work on this problem and the Embassy had
                            just received a telegram asking that he and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_THK1">Tong</persName> take the matter up with the
                            Department of State. He said he understood the difficulty of supplying
                            adequate amounts of surplus commodities and that the Department of
                            Agriculture might prefer that his government first purchase for cash
                            what it needed for normal consumption and then seek <gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 commodities above that figure. This
                            was impossible because of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>’s
                            shortage of foreign exchange. He mentioned that he had heard that India
                            had been granted 350 million dollars worth of <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                >PL</gloss> 480 commodities and he was sure that at least part of
                            this was for normal consumption purposes. He emphasized the importance
                            of a broad interpretation of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480, in
                            order to permit the supplying of Taiwan’s normal consumption needs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 program was limited to a billion
                            dollars for the entire world at cost price which was considerably above
                            the world market price and therefore there were smaller amounts of
                            commodities than that figure indicated. He said he would look into the
                            problem of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>’s request and see
                            what he could do about it.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yen</persName> then raised the
                            question of the Development Loan Fund and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that four
                            projects—the Shihmen Dam, the Tung-men Hydro project, the aluminum plant
                            and the project of rubber tire manufacture—were receiving priority
                            consideration in Washington. He urged that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> submit promptly any additional suitable projects.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the
                            establishment of the Development Loan Fund represented a basic change in
                            our method of extending aid. It had been placed on a multi-year basis so
                            that it would be easier to plan ahead on long term projects rather than
                            have to <pb n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0667"/>depend on year by year
                            allocations. Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yen</persName>
                            agreed that was an improvement over the previous method.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> concluded the
                            conversation by assuring Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_THK1"
                                >Tong</persName> and Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yen</persName> that we would do our utmost to see that the aid
                            funds available were fairly apportioned among the recipient countries in
                            the Far East, since these programs were very important ones.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Communist China’s State Council issued a regulation November 17 providing
                            for a sweeping decentralization of economic authority. In the industrial
                            field, the central government retains control of the major industrial
                            enterprises and continues to establish the more important performance
                            targets. But in other respects, much of the authority previously
                            exercised by the central government is now delegated to a lower
                            governmental level or to the enterprises themselves. Similarly, there is
                            to be a decentralization of control over commerce and finance. The new
                            fiscal regulations provide for local governments to share on a fixed
                            percentage basis in tax revenues and enterprise profits and for a
                            sharper distinction between central and local expenditure
                            responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>There is a similarity between these measures and the Soviet trend of the
                            past several years toward economic decentralization, and it is probable
                            that the Soviet trend had some influence on Peiping’s thinking. However,
                            Peiping’s action appears to meet specific domestic problems rather than
                            a deliberate act of conformity to the new Soviet pattern. It does not
                            bear much resemblance to this year’s Soviet reorganization of industrial
                            management along regional lines. The Chinese Communist action was
                            forecast in Premier <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s
                            report to the National People’s Congress on June 26, 1957 when he said,
                            “in the past two years … the central authorities were found to have
                            taken too much into their own hands; there were shortcomings resulting
                            from rigidity in administration … [in consequence] we began an
                            examination of the government structure … [and have] now decided to make
                            suitable readjustments expanding the powers of local authorities, so
                            that their creative initiative may be fully developed under the
                            coordinating leadership of the central authorities …”<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d297fn2">Brackets and ellipses in the source text.</note>
                            Peiping editorial comment on the new measures stressed that the previous
                            high degree of centralization was necessary, but that changed
                            circumstances now require a revision of the control mechanism; there was
                            no reference to Soviet economic decentralization.</p>
                        <p>Although a major shift in economic organization, the step does not appear
                            to reflect any change of basic economic objectives. It may <pb n="641"

                            foreign diplomatic missions in Peiping to an unprecedented two-hour
                            conference on November 15, 1957 to make clear categorically that Peiping
                            henceforth would attend no conferences at which the <gloss

                            recognizing the impasse of its present position, was pursuing a “two
                            Chinas” policy in the hope of easing its ultimate recognition of Peiping
                            and obtaining wider recognition for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Peiping will never accept a “two Chinas” solution, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> said, adding that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>’s opposition to this
                            solution also constituted a snag for the US policy, and that US pressure
                            on <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> might force the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to attempt an attack on the mainland.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> said that Peiping would
                            not “lose patience” in the Geneva talks and was prepared to continue
                            talking for 10 or 20 years, but that it would not fall into the “trap”
                            of renouncing the use of force in regard to Taiwan while the US refused
                            to withdraw its armed forces.</p>
                        <p>Peiping is apparently becoming increasingly concerned that the “two
                            Chinas” concept may be gaining wider international support. A number of
                            recent bloc actions can be interpreted as constituting at least a
                            temporary acceptance of the present situation in other divided
                            countries; Peiping may have wanted to make it clear that this acceptance
                            by no means extends to the situation in China. By stating categorically
                            its position on future conferences, Peiping may be hoping to force those
                            countries that recognize it to take a more clear-cut stand whenever the
                            issue arises in the future.</p>
                        <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0671"/>
                        <p>Less clear is the motivation for the argument that the US is adopting a
                            “two Chinas” policy—a point never before brought out so categorically in
                            a top-level Chinese Communist statement. Peiping may genuinely believe
                            that the US is gradually coming around to such a policy; the Chinese
                            Communists have often stated their belief that the US will ultimately
                            recognize the Peiping regime and may now believe that the US plans not
                            to abandon the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> even when it
                            recognizes Communist China. Propaganda exploitation of this thesis might
                            serve to raise doubts regarding US constancy, particularly in the minds
                            of Chinese Nationalists. At the same time, Peiping must recognize that
                            widespread acceptance of its thesis might lead countries that regard the
                            “two Chinas” formula as a reasonable solution to the China problem to
                            place the onus for US-Communist China frictions more on Peiping and less
                            on the US.</p>

                                    London and has been participating in the talks as advisor to

                        <p>With respect to the first suggestion, shifting the meeting place to
                            Warsaw would put us at a disadvantage. Press facilities, ease of access
                            and the traditional role of Switzerland as a neutral meeting place all
                            argue in favor of keeping the talks in Geneva.</p>
                        <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0672"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName> would be a good choice if
                            it should be decided to continue the talks at the ambassadorial level.
                            He has an intimate knowledge of the China problem and is a competent
                            negotiator.</p>
                        <p>On balance, I favor lowering the level of the talks and having them
                            conducted by <persName>Martin</persName>. This would give us an
                            opportunity to express our dissatisfaction at the failure of the
                            Communists to fulfill their promise to release the imprisoned Americans
                            and to renounce the use of force. It would also be an effective
                            rejoinder to <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s
                            statements to the assembled diplomats in Peiping on November 15, that
                            the United States is pushing the two-China concept as a preliminary to
                            recognizing <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s Government (see

                            think we need fear that this action on our part is likely to cause the
                            Chinese Communists to break off the talks, particularly in view of
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s statement regarding the
                            Geneva talks at the same meeting that they were ready to continue
                            talking for 10 or 20 years if necessary. Our statement could be phrased
                            in such a way as to give us freedom of action to propose restoring the
                            talks to the ambassadorial level whenever we might consider that
                            desirable.</p>

                                Ninety-three copies of this memorandum were distributed to American
                                military officers on Taiwan likely to have to answer “questions

                                February 21, 1958. In commenting on the December 3 policy statement,
                                the Embassy noted that “In conversations locally among U.S.

                                will probably increase, although only gradually, over the next few
                                years, unless there is a serious crisis within China, a major change
                                in the world situation, or a substantial increase in the strength of
                                the factors which work against Peiping’s aspirations.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Asia is impressed by the progress which the Chinese Communists
                                have made in developing their economy and increasing their military
                                power. Most Asian governments believe that the Communist regime is
                                firmly in control of the country and growing in strength. The
                                countries of the area, whether firmly anti-Communist or neutralist,
                                take possible Chinese Communist reactions into consideration when
                                making major policy decisions.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Against the background of power which Peiping is able to project,
                                many Asian countries are susceptible to its varied appeals and
                                pressures. Communist China will continue to pose as the champion of
                                peace and economic development and to identify itself with the
                                widespread anti-Western prejudices which arose out of colonial
                                experience. Many Asian leaders have an intellectual sympathy for
                                Marxist economic concepts. Many believe also that in their
                                underdeveloped countries there is no feasible alternative to state
                                planning <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0678"/>and financing of
                                major economic development. In these circumstances, there is a
                                tendency to be more tolerant of the Communist economic system even
                                when there is recognition of and opposition to its excesses.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>On the other hand, there are important factors which work against
                                Peiping’s aspirations. Many Asian leaders dislike Communism, fear
                                Communist China and mistrust its intentions. The most important
                                factor limiting the expansion of its influence is the presence of
                                the US in Asia as an opposing force, supplying elements of strength
                                which the free nations still lack. Another major factor will be the
                                degree of success of non-Communist governments in achieving a level
                                of economic, political, and social progress acceptable to their
                                people.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>For the most part, the present leaders of Asia value their
                                hard-won independence and recognize the ultimate threat of
                                indigenous and Chinese Communism. They are seeking—with varying
                                degrees of skill and energy—to satisfy the needs and potential
                                pressures for social and economic betterment without sacrificing the
                                basic values of their own cultures. Although the various Asian
                                countries will react differently to Communist China in accordance
                                with their varying backgrounds and interests, those that are not
                                firmly anti-Communist are more apt to continue on or to take the
                                road to neutralism than the road to affiliation with Peiping. Among
                                such countries there will probably be an increase in contacts with
                                Peiping, which will enhance the prestige of Communist China.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Although Communist China’s military strength will almost certainly
                                increase, we believe that it will refrain from using military means
                                to achieve its objectives in Asia so long as its leaders believe
                                that this would result in effective US military counteraction.
                                Rather they will seek to expand their power and influence in Asia,
                                and to reduce that of the US, through other means. They will
                                continue to concentrate on economic inducements, the expansion of a
                                broad range of official and unofficial contacts, and political
                                subversion. They also hope to foster the development of indigenous
                                Communist movements which can influence Asian governments to adopt
                                policies favorable to Communist China and which might eventually
                                assume power by parliamentary means or insurrection.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Major political or economic crises inside Communist China would
                                considerably diminish its impact on Asia. On the other hand, any
                                modification of US policy which appeared to Asians as a significant
                                softening of US constancy and firmness in opposing Communist China
                                and in helping Asian countries to achieve their aspirations would
                                enhance Peiping’s prospects. This would be particularly true if
                                there appeared to be a significant weakening of US military
                                capabilities against Communist China. A major change in the climate
                                of the <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0679"/>cold war could have
                                important effects. Thus, if the Sino-Soviet Bloc became more
                                bellicose and threatening, there might be major policy changes in
                                some Asian countries with some seeking neutralism and others
                                increased affiliation with the West. Or, if tensions were reduced,
                                closer relations between Communist China and other Asian countries
                                would probably develop, with an eventual enlargement of Peiping’s
                                ability to influence Asia.</item>

                            <item>We believe that Peiping’s basic, long run objective is an Asia
                                ruled by Communist governments, amenable to Communist China’s
                                influence, and dependent upon it for trade and political guidance.
                                This long run objective, derived from Communist doctrine, is
                                reinforced by the traditional Chinese view of China as the center of
                                civilization.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>Peiping almost certainly realizes that an attempt to gain this
                                objective by military means would risk war with the US, so long as
                                the latter is committed to the defense of large parts of
                                non-Communist Asia. In addition, Communist China is seeking to
                                transform an impoverished, illiterate, agrarian society into a
                                modern industrial state with a powerful military establishment.
                                Communist China’s leaders appear to believe that their country needs
                                time to complete this transformation and that their foreign policies
                                must stop short of provoking destructive US military
                                retaliation.</item>

                            <item>Thus, Communist China is for the present directing its energies
                                toward more immediate objectives. These include weakening the power
                                position and influence of the US in Asia, increasing exploitable
                                neutralist attitudes and the susceptibility to Communist influence,
                                and gaining acceptance as the only legitimate government of China
                                and as a fully participating and increasingly important member of an
                                Asian community of nations. Moreover, they consider that their
                                revolution is incomplete so long as they do not control Taiwan and
                                they will almost certainly be prepared to exploit any opportunity to
                                this end providing it does not seriously risk war with the

                            <item>Assuming that there is no outbreak of war directly involving
                                Communist China, the Chinese Communist regime probably will remain
                                in firm control of the mainland of China, will continue to direct
                                its resources and energies largely to internal problems, and will
                                    <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0680"/>achieve some degree of
                                progress in economic development. Its military capabilities will
                                almost certainly increase as it improves the efficiency, arms and
                                equipment of its ground forces, continues to develop its air force,
                                and expands its naval and maritime capabilities. However, Communist
                                China will probably refrain from overt military aggression so long
                                as its leaders believe that this would result in effective US
                                military counteraction against the mainland.</item>

                            <item>Under these conditions and assuming no drastic changes in US
                                policy or in the intensity or character of the struggle between the
                                Communist and non-Communist worlds, we believe that over the next
                                few years the already powerful impact of Communist China in Asia
                                will continue to increase, although only gradually. The presence of
                                the US in Asia will continue to be the major factor damping down the
                                growth of Peiping’s influence and obstructing Peiping’s efforts to
                                translate its growing prestige into specific action, such as
                                diplomatic recognition or admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss>. There are many other factors which may counteract
                                the impact of Communist China. One of particular importance would be
                                the success of non-Communist governments in achieving a level of
                                economic, political, and social progress acceptable to their people.
                                In any event, we believe that there will be an increase in Peiping’s
                                cultural and economic relations with other Asian countries, which
                                will enhance its prestige. With respect to the two most important
                                countries of the area, India is unlikely to make any significant
                                change in its policy toward Communist China as long as <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> heads the government; Japan,
                                although moving toward an increase of officially approved trade and
                                cultural relations, is likely to stop short of any over-all
                                rapprochement that would jeopardize its relations with the US.
                                Nevertheless, we believe that five years hence the weight of
                                Communist China on Asia and its ability to influence developments in
                                the area will have increased somewhat.</item>

                            <item>Any modification of US policy which was interpreted in Asia as
                                tending toward a significant softening of US constancy and firmness
                                in opposing Communist China would enhance Peiping’s prospects for
                                expanding its influence. This would be particularly true if such
                                modification resulted in a significant weakening of US military
                                capabilities against Communist China. Likewise a substantial
                                reduction in US support and assistance to Asian countries would
                                probably be interpreted as a lessening of US interest in the destiny
                                of the countries affected and would increase economic difficulties
                                in these countries. This would, in varying degrees, enhance
                                Communist China’s prospects.</item>

                            <item>A significant change in the intensity of the East-West struggle
                                could have important effects. If the Sino-Soviet Bloc dropped its

                                and threatening, we believe that throughout Asia there would be a

                                of national positions and of the relative power positions of the US
                                and of the Sino-Soviet Bloc. There would probably be a clearer
                                demarcation of Communist and non-Communist influence in Asia,
                                although not necessarily along present lines. For example, Thailand
                                especially is sensitive to trends in the relative strengths of the
                                major powers in the Far East and might shift to neutralism if its
                                leaders concluded a war of uncertain outcome was imminent. Burma, on
                                the other hand, might seek increased ties with the West.</item>

                                present suspicions of Peiping and move gradually toward broader
                                contacts and normal diplomatic relations with Communist China. This,
                                in time, would enlarge Peiping’s ability to influence these

                            <item>Major developments within Communist China could also affect the
                                impact of Communist China in Asia. A serious and prolonged crisis on
                                the mainland would impede Peiping’s efforts by undermining its pose
                                as a progressive and dynamic state, while a marked improvement in
                                conditions would, on the other hand, enhance Peiping’s prestige.
                                Moreover, serious economic and political difficulties in any of the
                                Asian countries would increase its vulnerability to Peiping’s
                                blandishments, while an improvement in internal stability would have
                                an opposite effect.</item>

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> said the Chinese forces
                            now consisted of 21 divisions plus two tank divisions, a parachute
                            regiment, a marine division and one marine brigade (the latter not yet
                            combat-ready). These units were at 95% strength. Equipment was rated at
                            84% and training 80%. They were considered combat-ready.</p>
                        <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0682"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> inquired how many
                            troops there were altogether.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> replied there were
                            11,000 combat troops in a division, but a division slice was 15,000.
                            Total combat forces were 375,000. If Navy, Air and Service Forces were
                            included the total would be close to 600,000.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>, Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1"
                                >Yu</persName> stated that 1/3 of the forces were Taiwanese, who
                            made very good soldiers. Since drafting of Taiwanese began only three
                            years ago, there are as yet no Taiwanese officers. There has not been
                            time for them to advance to officer rank. There are two ways to become
                            an officer: to be promoted up through the ranks, or to enter the
                            officers’ academy. Candidates are selected for officer training on a
                            merit basis, irrespective of whether they are Taiwanese or mainlanders.
                            As time passes, Taiwanese will become officers.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> explained that youths
                            reaching 20 years of age are drafted regardless of whether they were of
                            Taiwanese or mainland origin. They are given four months recruit
                            training and then assigned to one of the 21 divisions where they
                            complete 20 months’ service. They then become reservists and are
                            obligated to serve one month per year. There are already 15,000
                            reservists who have completed their two years’ service.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> inquired what the
                            attitude of the Taiwanese was regarding return to the mainland.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> replied that he had not
                            asked this question of the soldiers, but believed they should feel the
                            same as mainlanders because of the Communist menace to Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> agreed that the
                            Taiwanese soldiers should feel that way but asked the Minister what
                            evidence there was that they did. He said he was frequently asked this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> replied that he had
                            probably spent more time at the front lines than any other official in
                            the Chinese Government, having recently made his 100th visit to Matsu.
                            He had not talked with the Taiwanese soldiers concerning this point, but
                            had no reason to believe that they were opposed to return to the
                            mainland, beyond feeling the universal reluctance to leave one’s home.
                            He referred to the refusal of the Hunan troops to leave Hunan Province
                            to fight the Taipings. The Szechwan troops during World War II were also
                            reluctant to leave Szechwan Province, but were made to realize the best
                            way to defend Szechwan was to fight the Japanese outside the province
                            rather than allow the war to come there. The same is true with respect
                            to Taiwan, and the attitude of the soldiers will depend on how the case
                            is presented to them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> inquired how much
                            intermarriage there is between mainlanders and Taiwanese.</p>
                        <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0683"/>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> said there was very
                            little, principally because the Chinese were very clannish. He himself
                            was married to his first cousin and a number of his relatives had made
                            similar marriages within the clan. Mainland families are more willing to
                            have their sons marry Taiwanese girls than to have their daughters marry
                            into Taiwanese families because of differences in customs. Of course, as
                            time goes on increasing intermarriage is inevitable.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> remarked that in
                            present day Asia no one can predict where trouble will break out next.
                            We could not, for example, have predicted the Indonesian reaction
                            against the Dutch. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            interjected that we had anticipated that one. Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> went on to say that since trouble may
                            break out unexpectedly, it is necessary to be prepared. He recognized
                            that the Chinese cannot at this time develop a pentomic division on the
                            United States model but his staff in consultation with <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has developed what they call the
                            “forward look” to modernize the Chinese Army. This proposal will soon be
                            sent by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to the Department of
                            Defense. On the assumption that the cold war will continue and that
                            brush fires may break out anywhere, it is important to have not only
                            combat-ready troops but “export-ready” troops and there is quite a
                            difference between the two.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> commented that if
                            the only front we had to worry about were the Taiwan front, we could do
                            things very differently. However, we are confronted with a global threat
                            and we must recognize that we face a common enemy in Germany, Viet Nam,
                            opposite Taiwan, and in Korea. One thing that worries Americans is the
                            possibility that one of our allies might precipitate military conflict
                            for which the free world is not prepared.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> replied that the United
                            States could rely on the Chinese not to act independently.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> responded that he
                            himself was confident that they wouldn’t. He had known President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> and Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> both for many years and was satisfied
                            that they would cooperate fully. He was concerned rather about President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and certain other
                            individuals who might exercise less discretion.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> pointed out that independent
                            action by the Chinese without American support would certainly not serve
                            China’s enlightened self-interest, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> agreed and added that of course we must be
                            prepared for any eventuality.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> inquired where he
                            thought trouble was likely to start. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> replied that of course no one could tell. The
                            point is that we must maintain both our strength and our patience. There
                            can be no successful revolt by unarmed people against modern weapons as
                            was shown in Hungary, but if there had been a Hungarian Government in
                            exile across the border with an armed force, things <pb n="656"
                                xml:id="pg_656" facs="0684"/>might have turned out differently. In
                            any totalitarian state the opposition of the people can only become
                            effective when the army takes the side of the people. Time he said was
                            on our side and we must guard against any unwise action which would
                            precipitate military action prematurely.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> responded that the
                            Chinese believed that the free world would win in the long run, even
                            though it had only parity in weapons rather than superiority. He assured
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> that the Chinese
                            intended to continue full cooperation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> replied that no ally had been more cooperative
                            than the Republic of China. He went on to say, however, that in the last
                            session of Congress he had been asked in a classified Committee hearing
                            how we knew the Chinese would not act independently. He had referred to
                            the treaty and exchange of notes with the Chinese and when his statement
                            later became public and was printed in Taiwan, he was lambasted in the
                            Chinese press for having said that the Chinese could be depended upon
                            not to act independently.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> commented that of
                            course it is impossible for the Chinese to move independently against
                            the mainland without United States logistic support. He had appeared
                            before his own Congress and explained why it would not be in the
                            enlightened self-interest of China to attack the mainland without United
                            States support. He had felt he had made some impression. He went on to
                            say that the important thing was not the amount of money contributed by
                            the United States for developing military capability to resist the
                            Communists but the total operational capability for such resistance. For
                            example, a year ago he had been offered a squadron of all-weather
                            fighters for the Chinese Air Force. He had turned down the offer
                            pointing out that it would take two years to train Chinese pilots to
                            operate these planes and asked instead that a United States squadron of
                            such fighters be stationed in Taiwan. He had suggested to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName> that Nike missiles be
                            placed on Taiwan. This new attitude on the part of the Chinese he
                            referred to as “the Copernican revolution in Chinese thought.” They no
                            longer think in terms of the amount of money needed for Chinese forces
                            but of the total operational capability of combined United States and
                            Chinese forces in the area.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that
                            whether the money goes to the Chinese or is used for United States
                            forces, it had to be covered by appropriations. Congress had cut one
                            billion dollars from the mutual security program last year and at the
                            same time had cut two billion dollars from the United States defense
                            budget. Our programs have to be adjusted to this reality.</p>

                                    anticipated that the Chinese reply would be that they would be
                                    prepared to resume the talks at such time as the United States
                                    appointed an ambassador to replace <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                        >Johnson</persName>, but that they would see little purpose
                                    in meetings at a lower level. If the Chinese did agree to
                                    continue the talks at a lower level, <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"

                                    sensitive on the subject of corresponding levels and we can be
                                    sure that even if they do agree to resume with
                                        <persName>Martin</persName> they will be very careful also
                                    to appoint a First Secretary, to correspond with Ed’s rank in
                                    London. This will, in fact, mean that their man will be
                                    considerably below Ed in competence and authority as Ed would
                                    normally be a Counselor in any post but one such as London. Thus
                                    any meetings Ed may have will be on an even more routine level
                                    than those I have been having. I think, for example, that they
                                    will refuse even to enter into any discussion whatever of
                                    matters such as renunciation of force”. (<hi rend="italic"

                                    Chinese would be unwilling to negotiate with him. In a letter
                                    from London to <persName corresp="#p_CRN1">Clough</persName> on
                                    December 6, <persName>Martin</persName> wrote:</p>
                                <p>“I think it virtually inconceivable that <persName
                                        corresp="#p_WP1">Wang</persName> will agree to negotiate
                                    personally with me and unlikely that he will agree at the
                                    meeting to designate another representative. While I concur in
                                    your judgment that the Chinese Communists are unlikely to break
                                    off the talks, I think they may be willing to see them suspended
                                    indefinitely on the issue of the level at which they are to be
                                    conducted. They may argue that just because the talks have
                                    bogged down is no reason to put them on a lower level. Progress
                                    is less likely at a lower level (their line may run) than at the
                                    Ambassadorial level, while if we are really sincere in our
                                    desire to settle differences, we should agree to talks on the
                                    Foreign Minister level. Thus the Chinese Communists may well
                                    take the occasion of Alex’s departure to renew their propaganda
                                    for Foreign Minister level meeting, though indicating
                                    willingness to continue at the Ambassadorial level. My guess is
                                    that they may hold to this position for some time, making clear
                                    that they are not breaking off the talks but simply waiting
                                    until we have seen fit to appoint another Ambassador to carry
                                    them on.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., CA Files: Lot 60 D 648,

                            Change must be evaluated in our own people, among our allies and
                            friends, among the overseas Chinese, and in two of our client countries

                            results. The ratification of the U.S.–China Mutual Defense Treaty, which
                            was signed in Washington on December 2, 1954, undoubtedly prevented an
                            attack against Taiwan by the armed forces of Communist China. The
                            presence of massive and mobile U.S. retaliatory power in the Western
                            Pacific, backing up our policies toward China, has indubitably served to
                            preserve peace in the Western Pacific. The wise decision of the
                            Secretary of State to agree to undertake limited diplomatic
                            conversations with the representatives of Peking, which have been
                            conducted now for over a period of two years, has served on the
                            diplomatic front to preserve peace. Although the People’s Republic of
                            China has thus far refused to meet the main American point of
                            renunciation of the use of force in accomplishing changes in the Western
                            Pacific, the fact that the diplomatic conversations have been continued
                            has in itself been an assurance against the outbreak of hostilities.</p>

                                authorized trade or you are going to have clandestine trade. You can
                                stop the shipments from here. That is on the law, and that will be
                                continued as long as it is on the law. But whether or not it should
                                be, whether we should eliminate this differential, frankly, I don’t

                        <p>The first fact to be evaluated is the degree of stability and public
                            support of the People’s Republic of China. Most impartial observers are
                            in agreement that the Peking Government is solidly in control of
                            Mainland China. There is undoubtedly a widespread element of discontent
                            under the communist regime, but for many centuries there have been
                            similar elements of discontent in China against any regime which was
                            incapable of fulfilling the almost limitless needs of the Chinese
                            population. There seems little doubt that in the entire history of China
                            no more effective military apparatus has been created. In the history of
                            China this military force has for the first time been made up of
                            indigenous elements, despite Red China’s dependence on the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for many military and strategic
                            supplies. The military striking power of China on the Mainland does not
                            depend upon foreign stimulus as was the case when the great predatory
                            movements from Peking were fired by northern blood from beyond the
                            Wall.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">1. Estimate of the Overseas Chinese</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The fact of Peking’s supremacy on the Mainland is perhaps most readily
                            revealed by the shift in the weather-vane loyalties of the overseas
                            Chinese, one of the most over-valued minorities on the globe. These
                            Chinese living abroad in other countries of Asia have as their basic
                            patriotism a passionate devotion to the pocketbook. They are usually
                            found on the winning side. If <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> should be able to return to the Mainland and
                            overthrow the communist regime, the overseas Chinese would have his
                            picture everywhere. However, their current assessment results in an
                            increasing display of the countenance of <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao
                                Tse-tung</persName>. The overseas Chinese generally experience a
                            feeling of vicarious pride that there is in their estimation a strong
                            government in Peking, dominated by no foreign influence, which has
                            brought about a recrudescence of Chinese power not witnessed in more
                            than a hundred years, since the treaty which terminated the Opium War in
                            1842. We may not agree with this assessment, particularly in regard to
                            foreign influence over the regime. However, most of the overseas Chinese
                            in Asia are at present proud of Peking, and will not or do not see the
                            menace of Communism enthroned in the Middle Kingdom.</p>

                                Supply</hi></p>
                        <p>The population of China is increasing at the rate of 12 million people a
                            year. As the Peking regime strives to improve the economy, vast
                            engineering projects for flood control will eventually reduce the
                            perennial damage of flood and its corollary, famine. These works,
                            combined with the application of modern public health techniques, <pb
                                n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0692"/>will result in an increase in
                            population. Therefore the immemorial balance of nature in China is
                            changing. As the birth rate continues to rise and the death rate goes
                            down, there is a strong chance that for once Malthus’ theory of the
                            pressure of population on food supply will come into practical
                            application. To counter his syllogism the Peking Government has
                            instituted an ambitious program for increasing the food supply. The norm
                            to be met by 1965 calls for no less than doubling the production of
                            cereals in China. Whether in fact this goal can be attained before the
                            increasing numbers of mouths to be fed cry for a change in policy is one
                            of the mightiest questions which Mainland China and Asia must face. If
                            in fact the food supply does not balance with the population’s need, it
                            seems inevitable that the rulers of China will look to filling their
                            nation’s wants by taking over the rice-bowl countries which fringe China
                            to the south and west—Viet-Nam, Cambodia, Thailand and Burma. These
                            countries, therefore, with India as an anxious spectator, will acquire
                            an even more uneasy interest in the policies of Peking.</p>

                            that if more than 30% of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> troops

                        <p>Our Military Attachés calculate that if a movement against the Mainland
                            is not initiated within the next five to seven years it will not be
                            possible for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> further to dream of
                            reconquest. The Attaches provide lists of indicators, some or all of
                            which would be present if the Chinese Government decided to initiate an
                            attack against Mainland China. Perhaps the most disturbing of these
                            indicators are the possibilities that an attack might be launched
                            without warning, under the guise of large-scale maneuvers, or that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> might deliberately launch a

                        <p>The United States, therefore, in assessing the facts on China is
                            confronted with a powerful government on Mainland China controlling 600

                            Mainland Chinese. The military balance of power as between the

                            7th Fleet, of Strategic Air Command bases in the Western Pacific, and of
                            American troops in Korea and Okinawa. There is at present an effective

                            and Mainland China in the Western Pacific, including the de facto

                        <p>The political question most affecting the future of China and of greatest
                            immediate importance, is the issue of which government of China should
                            represent that country in the United Nations. According to the analysis
                            quoted earlier in this paper, it would seem that the eventual admission
                            of the Peking Government to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as
                            representing all of China is inevitable. The British agreed once more

                            practically certain that with the change in attitudes which will take
                            place following the relaxation of trade controls, the increase of power
                            on the Mainland, and the superannuation <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666"

                            Peking, which controls the Mainland of China and the destinies of 600
                            million inhabitants of the earth, is in truth the Government of China.
                            The plain fact must be recognized that other nations have accepted the
                            fiction that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is one of the Big
                            Five in the Security Council solely because of strenuous and unremitting
                            pressure by the United States. The reflex to constant pressure on this
                            point is growing less automatic. Eventually it will disappear and our
                            allies along with the uncommitted countries will vote Peking into the
                            seat occupied by Taipei.</p>

                        <p>The question of recognition of Peking is a corollary to the more
                            immediate and basic issue of admission to the United Nations. There have
                            been a number of indications that various countries of the Free World
                            and of the so-called uncommitted area will condition their policy of
                            non-recognition or recognition of Peking dependent upon the action taken
                            in the United Nations. There is no doubt that once the Peoples Republic
                            of China is admitted to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            recognition of Peking will be almost universal. Whether or not at that
                            time the United States should recognize Peking will be a matter for
                            determination in light of our self-interest.</p>

                        <p>If and when the People’s Republic of China is admitted to the United
                            Nations as occupying the seat of the Republic of China, which is
                            reserved for that country by the Charter, there will be an immense gain
                            in prestige by Communist China throughout Asia and the world. There will
                            ensue in consequence, because of the long-sustained and adamant
                            opposition by the United States to the admission of Communist China to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, a corresponding loss of “face”
                            for the United States. To the simple-minded, “The Commies won, the U.S.
                            lost.”</p>
                        <p>The question then becomes one of whether or not this Government believes
                            that the admission of Communist China to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> is in fact inevitable. From the evidence available, it
                            seems to the writer of this paper that whether we like it or not within
                            the not-too-distant future the government of Peking will be seated in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as representing China. The
                            question then becomes: not that China <hi rend="italic">will</hi> gain
                            face and the United States lose face, but <hi rend="italic">how
                                much</hi> gain and loss of prestige and influence will be involved
                            in this changed situation?</p>
                        <p>The argument can be advanced unhesitatingly that if the United States
                            continues its present policy and is beaten, Red China will gain
                            infinitely more in prestige and influence than if the United States <pb

                            the actual situation, and is able to negotiate a settlement with
                            Mainland China which will be to our advantage. If such a settlement can
                            in fact be negotiated before Red China is admitted to the <gloss

                            will be far less. The United States will be respected as a realistic
                            power, seeking to insure the peace of the Pacific. In terms of loss of
                            face, therefore, there is much to be said for the United States now to
                            reassess its China policy and to draw new conclusions from present
                            facts.</p>
                        <p>It must be pointed out, however, that the time is now late to negotiate a
                            settlement with Communist China which will produce as much advantage to
                            the United States as when the diplomatic stakes for Peking were
                            greater.</p>

                                <p>Before examining the outline of a potential settlement in the
                                    Pacific, it is only fair to examine the possibility of
                                    continuing our present policy unchanged. The United States, as
                                    paymaster of the Free World, can quite possibly contrive for
                                    another five years or so to dragoon the vote of the supposedly
                                    sovereign members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to
                                    assure the continuing exclusion of Peking. Although we couch our
                                    policy in terms of purest principle, we should not, at least to
                                    ourselves, have any illusions as to the pragmatic basis from
                                    which our allies approach this problem. Paul-Henri Spaak<note

                                    probably expressed the feeling most gently when he indicated
                                    within his own government that although he disagreed strongly
                                    with the Americans on their emotional attitude over the
                                    admission of Red China to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                                    the United States was nevertheless the leading power of the Free
                                    World and lesser friends of the U.S. should defer to its desire
                                    on this issue. Therefore, so long as the U.S. supplies not only
                                    the butter, but most of the bread, to many of the members of the
                                        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, we can count with some
                                    assurance on being able in fact to buy their vote. Nevertheless,
                                    in the long run this will not suffice because our allies
                                    basically do not believe either in the practicality of excluding
                                    Mainland China or the principle which we assert is involved.</p>

                                        <p>A more serious criticism of the proposed maximum
                                            settlement is the fact that the People’s Republic of
                                            China may now feel that if, according to the evidence
                                            available to it, its admission to the United Nations is
                                            already assured, there is no real need to make
                                            concessions now to expedite the achievement of the
                                            inevitable. Furthermore, the People’s Republic of China
                                            has consistently resisted any claim that Taiwan should
                                            not be considered as an integral part of Mainland China.
                                            Again, on its assessment of the evidence Peking may have
                                            concluded that the tenure of the Nationalists on Taiwan
                                            is brief and that all Mainland China need do is wait for
                                            the death of <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                                Kai-shek</persName> and the superannuation of his
                                            forces. The <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> may
                                            therefore refuse to consider the so-called “two China”
                                            concept. The Government in Peking similarly might prefer
                                            to take its chances of reunifying Korea and Viet-Nam on
                                            Communist terms, or, failing that, to maintain the
                                            present stalemate of divided regimes in both Korea and
                                            Viet-Nam. In Peking the giving up of suzerainty over
                                            Tibet might imply considerable loss of face. Peking thus
                                            far has resisted any proposal that it renounce the use
                                            of force in settlement of disputes and might prefer not
                                            to tie its hands in the future, particularly if it
                                            envisages the necessity of moving against the rice-bowl
                                            countries to the south and west.</p></item>

                                            oppose neutralization, and the premature divulgence that
                                            such an objective was in view over the long run might in
                                            fact trigger off attacks made in desperation by
                                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Syngman Rhee</persName>

                                            while they still felt able to count on U.S. support. Of
                                            a similar nature would be the natural reluctance of the
                                            Government in Taiwan to give up its seat, as

                                            it should be compensated by being elected to membership

                                            would provide another Communist veto, since two vetoes

                                    acceptance of the Charter’s responsibilities. The recognition of
                                    the establishment of a new state in Taiwan might not on either

                                            a guarantee of independence has the added advantage of
                                            bringing Japan once more into its historic role in the
                                            maintenance of Korea as a buffer state. Japan, since the
                                            year when the Spanish Armada was wrecked by storm in the
                                            English Channel and the similar Armada of Kublai Khan
                                            was wrecked by storm in the Yellow Sea, has never lost
                                            from sight the fact that “Korea is a dagger pointing at
                                            the heart of Japan.” In the late 16th century Hideyoshi
                                            conquered Korea and in the campaign acquired a
                                            sufficiently large collection of human ears to make the

                                            The Japanese in the late 19th century contested
                                            vigorously through diplomatic means against
                                                <persName>Yuan Shi Kai</persName> in Peking, and
                                            ultimately went to war with Russia over the issue of who
                                            should be dominant in Korea. In 1911 they annexed the
                                            so-called “Land of Morning Calm.” Thus in the history of
                                            Japan there has developed an almost automatic reflex on
                                            the question of the governance of Korea. If this

                                            base supposedly integral to the island chain which forms

                                            pointed out that the Nationalist forces, like their
                                            leader, are heading downhill toward superannuation.
                                            Furthermore, with the increased range of aircraft, the
                                            mobility of the 7th Fleet and the development of

                                            settlement would be the involvement of India as a
                                            guaranteeing power. The signature by India of such a
                                            pact would place that country essentially on the side of
                                            the West, since the United States does not intend to
                                            resort to force to alter the situation in East Asia and
                                            there is considerable reason to believe that China has

                                            would ipso facto find itself ranged with the United

                        <p>Unless the United States accommodates itself to the mutations of time, we
                            shall find that time works against us. In the long run, the things we
                            seek most to prevent by our present policies may with the passage of the
                            years transpire, and without the United States having been able to wrest
                            what minimal advantages may yet exist in an inauspicious situation.
                            However, over the longer range, and by canalizing the interests of the
                            Asian powers to sustain a definitive Pacific settlement, it should be
                            possible to assure the maintenance of peace in East Asia with a
                            corresponding reduction in U.S. military and economic expenditure, and
