                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch No. 425; and so likewise your despatch
                            enclosing me a copy of the communication from the government of France
                            to that of the United States, on the subject of equipping, victualling,
                            or receiving Russian privateers into our ports, was duly received; but,
                            as you will already have learned by my despatches, which you have
                            doubtless received since yours was written, it was unnecessary. Having
                            found copies of that despatch from the French government in the British
                            parliamentary papers, as well as in the 6th edition of Wheaton’s
                            International Law, I had fully anticipated your wishes, by communicating
                            the same to Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys, accompanied by a communication, dated
                            November 6, anticipating all the suggestions made by you.</p>
                        <p>A copy of this communication to Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys I enclosed to you in
                            my despatch No. 372, <note n="*" xml:id="d1fn1">[38th Congress, 1st
                                session, House Ex. Doc. No. 1, page 803.]</note> to which I beg to
                            refer you. I have only to add that no answer has been received to my
                            communication from Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys. It is proper to say, however,
                            that I believe he has been much engaged recently upon pending European
                            questions, and at present he is not in Paris, but with the Emperor at
                            Compiegne, where he will yet remain for some days.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor’s speech at the opening of the Corps Legislatif, and his
                            subsequent letter to the different governments of Europe, inviting them
                            to a congress at Paris, continue to attract much attention. Questions
                            connected with this subject, I am inclined to think, occupy principally
                            the attention of the cabinet here.</p>
                        <p>I am anxious to see Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys upon a number of pending
                            questions, but there is no chance of doing so until his return.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I yesterday saw Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys for
                            the first time within the last fortnight. His absence from Paris, and
                            pressing engagements the week before, have prevented his receiving the
                            diplomatic corps for business.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0022"/>
                        <p>I called his attention at once to the Florida at Brest, and to the
                            repairs and recruitment of her crew, reading to him extracts from
                            letters I had received on the subject. He begged I would give him a copy
                            of these papers, and I have this morning sent the same to him. I send
                            you herewith a copy of my communication to him, which will itself
                            explain the condition of things here, both as respects the Florida and
                            the vessels now being built at Bordeaux for the confederates.</p>
                        <p>I ought to add that he said that if any change or improvement in the
                            batteries or fighting powers of the Florida had been made, it was
                            against law and against orders. He said, furthermore, that he had
                            himself personally informed Messrs. Arman &amp; Yoruz, (the constructor
                            and iron founder,) engaged on those vessels now being built at Bordeaux
                            and Nantes, that the work thereon must cease, unless they could satisfy
                            him that they were honestly intended for another government; and he
                            added to me that he would at once refer their proceedings to the
                            minister of marine.</p>
                        <p>We have obtained an elaborate opinion from——that all the parties engaged
                            on those vessels, at Bordeaux and Nantes, are responsible to the
                            criminal laws of France. We cannot proceed, however, against Mr. Arman
                            personally, except by an application to and permission from the Corps
                            Legislatif, of which body he is a member. I have already asked you what
                            you thought of the propriety, or rather the wisdom, of this course of
                            proceeding. I am very averse to initiate a ptoceeding at law unless
                            quite sure of the result. If adverse, the consequences would be
                            injurious.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Ministre</hi>: Herewith I enclose to
                                your excellency the copy of an extract from a letter addressed to me
                                by Mr. Davisson, United States consul at Marseilles, dated November
                                24, 1863, in reference to the construction of two of the vessels now
                                being built for the confederates at that port. One of these vessels
                                is advertised in the “Gironde,” of that city, to sail on the 28th of
                                February, and the other on the 31st of March. The pretence that they
                                are intended for the China seas is yet kept up in this
                                advertisement, though the papers heretofore shown to your excellency
                                (especially the letter of Mr. Arman) afford the clearest evidence
                                that this pretence is a false one.</p>
                            <p>I enclose you, likewise, the copy of an extract of a letter from
                                Captain Winslow, of the United States ship Kearsarge, in reference
                                to the assistance and repairs made upon the confederate ship
                                Florida, at Brest. To these two subjects I called the attention of
                                your excellency on yesterday, when I likewise apprised you of the
                                fact that they were recruiting a crew for that vessel in the ports
                                of France, and that twenty-six men had already been enlisted in the
                                ports of Havre and Nantes, prior to the 11th instant. They have not
                                yet been received on board the Florida, though kept in pay by that
                                vessel, and ready to be shipped when the complement is complete. The
                                Florida is ready now to go to sea, and may do so at any day, unless
                                prevented by the authority of this government.</p>
                            <p>I regret, likewise, to be under the necessity of enclosing to your
                                excellency the copy of a letter received this morning from our
                                consul at Calais. It would seem from this that another confederate
                                steamer, the Rappahannock, has just arrived in that port, and is
                                awaiting aid. The same protests which have been made in respect to
                                the others, I beg to extend to her.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In the course of my conversation with Mr.
                            Drouyn de l’Huys yesterday, I referred briefly to what he had some time
                            since said to me in reference to an early acknowledgment of the new
                            government of Mexico. He said, pleasantly, that he feared he had been
                            too sanguine. I told him that our kind relations with the Juarez
                            government were unbroken, and that we did not anticipate an early and
                            permanent establishment of a monarchy in Mexico. In the present
                            condition of things, therefore, you did not feel at liberty to consider
                            the question he had propounded. I do not think that he was either
                            surprised or disappointed by this answer.</p>
                        <p>He informed me that the Emperor had been much gratified by your recent
                            action in forbidding the recruitment of men in the United States for
                            Mexico. This had been reported to him by Mr. Mercier. I reminded him, in
                            passing, that this action seemed to contrast somewhat with that of the
                            French authorities, in permitting the shipment of a crew for the Florida
                            in a French port. It seemed to me that the allusion was <hi
                                rend="italic">felt.</hi> He made a note of it, as I supposed, and
                            the conversation there dropped. I reminded him, however, that I had some
                            time since sent him a copy of that despatch in reference to Russian
                            privateers, sent to us at the beginning of the Crimean war. He said
                            that, owing to his absence, he had not yet seen it, nor my communication
                            which accompanied it.</p>

                                each of the great powers is distrustful of the others, and I am
                                greatly mistaken if the proposition does not turn out an

                            both inclusive, have been duly received.</p>
                        <p>Another confederate vessel, formerly the Victor, of the English navy, now
                            called by her captain the Rappahannock, has escaped from the English
                            port of Sheerness and run into Calais. I communicated the fact to Mr.
                            Drouyn de l’Huys last week, and he informed me that he immediately
                            referred the case to the minister of marine, from whom he has not yet
                            received an answer. Having since obtained additional information as to
                            this vessel, I had a conversation with him on the subject yesterday, and
                            at his request I have put that information in writing and sent it with
                            copies of affidavits to-day. Of this communication I herewith send you a
                            copy.</p>
                        <p>The copies of the affidavits made by Joseph Murray, Thomas Kelly and Wm.
                            Wynn, which I enclose to Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys, have doubtless been
                            already forwarded to you from London.</p>
                        <p>My despatch to Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys will apprise you of the present
                            condition of the Rappahannock, now at Calais.</p>
                        <p>I learn that this vessel had for some reason been rejected by the British
                            admiralty, and sold to a private purchaser, from whom she was bought by
                            the confederates, and subjected to great changes and repairs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys seems to be quite restive under this recent and <pb
                                n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0024"/>constant use of the French ports by
                            the confederates. He says it cannot have resulted from accident, but
                            that it is intended to compromise this government. I told him that this
                            was doubtless so, when he added that they would not be compromised; that
                            they meant to remain neutral. He said that if there were any person to
                            whom he could properly address himself he would give them to understand
                            that their action upon this subject was disagreeable.</p>
                        <p>I have apprised the captain of the United States ship Kearsarge of the
                            condition of things in the ports of France, and I have requested Mr.
                            Sprague, our consul at Gibraltar, to inform the captain of the St. Louis
                            as to the Rappahannock, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The confederates have more difficulties in procuring crews for their
                            vessels than they contemplated.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Ministre</hi>: A ship called by her
                                captain the Rappahannock, and purchased for the confederates of the
                                south, has made her escape from the British port of Sheerness
                                without papers, and run into the port of Calais. She claims, I am
                                informed, that she is driven in to repair her machinery, rigging,
                                &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>The facts as communicated to me are certain:</p>
                            <p>1. That she has been bought and fitted up by the confederates to
                                cruise against and destroy our commerce.</p>
                            <p>2. That, anticipating or fearing detention, she escaped in an
                                unfinished condition from the port of Sheerness, England, and has
                                come over to Calais to complete her equipment, &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>3. That a number of young Americans (some twelve or fourteen, I
                                think) have been awaiting at Calais the arrival of this vessel to go
                                aboard of her as officers or crew, and that upon a signal from the
                                vessel they made an attempt by a ruse to accomplish their purpose.
                                This shows that the vessel did not come in as pretended, “en reláche
                                force.”</p>
                            <p>4. Our consular agent writes me that it is quite evident the vessel
                                left the English port suddenly and unexpectedly, with the mechanics
                                employed on her yet on board; that considerable reparations and
                                changes are yet to be made upon her; that her rigging is incomplete,
                                and the ropes and pulleys are yet scattered over her decks. He
                                informed me also that it is understood the captain had said he had
                                applied or would apply to the minister of marine for permission to
                                take out and entirely repair her boilers.</p>
                            <p>5. I enclose likewise copies of two affidavits sent to me from the
                                United States legation at London, proving that this vessel left the
                                English port to go to Calais; that she was then incomplete; that she
                                waits at the port of Calais for her crew, and that she is, as her
                                captain says, a confederate privateer.</p>
                            <p>It is quite evident that this vessel occupies a position which
                                differs from either the Florida or the Georgia. She has left her
                                port on the other side of the channel, voluntarily, without papers,
                                and run directly across to a neighboring port, within which she
                                hopes to be protected until her equipment is completed and her
                                officers and crew ready.</p>
                            <p>On this statement of facts no argument is necessary to show that
                                permission <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0025"/>from the French
                                authorities to carry out her purpose would be a violation of
                                neutrality.</p>
                            <p>May I beg the attention of your excellency therefore, immediately to
                                this question.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys, in the course of
                            conversation yesterday, stated a fact which it is well, perhaps, that I
                            communicate to you. He said that some weeks ago the British government
                            informed them that an American vessel had been taken by the
                            confederates, as a prize, and sold to an Englishman; that after this she
                            had been retaken by one of our ships, and that you had, therefore,
                            refused to recognize the British title, coming, as it did, through a
                            confederate source. The English government thereupon resolved that it
                            would not recognize the right of the United States government to make
                            prizes of confederate vessels, and it submitted the proposition to the
                            French government, with a view to a just declaration to that effect. Mr.
                            Drouyn de l’Huys informed them in answer that this government had no
                            such case against us, and he thought it would be in bad taste to make
                            such declaration before a case occurred calling for it. He informed
                            them, further, that he did not know what course this government would
                            take in such an event, and be did not wish to anticipate it.</p>
                        <p>The conversation on the subject there ceased, and he said he did not know
                            what the British government had done.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Canada’s mails arrive at the latest
                            hour available for reply. I hasten to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            despatch of November 27, No. 379.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>It is, however, equally clear that this government has, under the law of
                            nations, an indisputable claim upon that of France to prevent the
                            departure of such expeditions from her coasts. It is worthy of serious
                            consideration whether the government of the United States, in becoming a
                            suitor in a French municipal court against French conspirators, would
                            not seem to imply at one and the same time a distrust of the justice of
                            the French government and a willingness to modify their claim upon
                            it.</p>
                        <p>In view of that consideration, the government is deliberating upon the
                            question whether it will authorize suits to be instituted in its name,
                            as is proposed.</p>
                        <p>William M. Evarts, esq., a lawyer of much learning, has heretofore
                            visited London for the purpose of conferring with our minister residing
                            there upon legal questions raised in that capital. He has now been
                            directed to return to London on the 30th instant, and he will be charged
                            to proceed to Paris and confer freely with you upon the subject of our
                            claims upon the French government. The President will reserve the
                            question of instituting legal proceedings in the French courts until we
                            shall have received your advice, fully matured, with the aid of any
                            suggestions that Mr. Evarts may be able to make. * * You will
                            communicate to Mr. Evarts all the facts which may be within your
                            knowledge and have a bearing on the case, as fully as you think they
                            ought to be reported to this department.</p>

                            No. 379.</p>
                        <p>I am authorized to approve of your renewed remonstrances to Mr. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys concerning the prosecution of the work on the rams which are
                            being built in the French ports, and the hospitalities extended to the
                            Florida and the Rappahannock.</p>
                        <p>You will persevere in these remonstrances if occasion shall warrant, and
                            represent to Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys that for more than two years this
                            government has borne, but has never acquiesced in, a policy of France
                            and Great Britain in which they have recognized as a naval belligerent a
                            domestic insurrection in this country, which has not held nor had a port
                            or harbor, either in the region it claims to represent or elsewhere; all
                            of whose ships are built, manned and equipped in the waters of Great
                            Britain and France themselves, and all of whose nautical proceedings are
                            conducted either in those waters or on the high seas, as an outlaw from
                            their own country and from all other civilized states. These proceedings
                            have been the subject of unremitted complaint and remonstrance. For all
                            the losses and damages which the government and citizens of the United
                            States have sustained by the depredation of the vessels in question, the
                            United States, as they believe, justly hold the governments of the
                            countries from which they have proceeded responsible, whenever they have
                            been duly forewarned, and have omitted proper measures to prevent the
                            departure of said hostile expeditions. During all this time we have been
                            at peace with France and Great Britain. We have practiced absolute
                            non-interference between them and their enemies in war, and have even
                            lent them the advantages of counsel, with moral influence, to enable
                            them to attain, without dishonor, the advantages of peace. We have
                            excused the unkindness of which we have complained, on the ground that
                            our own disloyal citizens, whom we could not effectually control, have
                            been active and skilful in misleading public opinion in Europe in regard
                            to the merits and probable results of our civil war. The evil,
                            nevertheless, is becoming very serious, and is rapidly alienating the
                            national sentiments of the United States. Our commerce is forced to seek
                            protection under the flags of the very governments which afford the
                            shelter of which we complain to the enemies engaged in devastating it.
                            We fully believe that, in like circumstances, neither France nor Great
                            Britain would endure such injuries as we are suffering, through the
                            policy they have established, unless, indeed, like the United States,
                            they were, at the same moment, deeply engaged in a formidable war,
                            either at home or abroad. The political drama is inconstant; the scene
                            may soon change. We may, at no distant day, be again at peace; and, in
                            the chances of the hour, European maritime powers may become
                            belligerents. Is it wise to leave open between them and the United
                            States questions which, in such an unfortunate conjuncture, would
                            produce confusion in regard to our own practice of neutral rights?</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of December 4 (No. 382) has
                            been received. Your <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0028"/>proceedings in
                            the case of the Rappahannock are approved, and the good disposition
                            which has been manifested by Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys in the matter is
                            appreciated.</p>
                        <p>I send herewith a copy of an extract, which has accidentally attracted my
                            notice, from what purports to be an annual report of S. R. Mallory, who
                            is pretending to act as secretary of the navy for the insurgents at
                            Richmond. So soon as I shall be able to procure a copy of the whole
                            paper, I shall transmit it to you. In the mean time, there is no room
                            for doubt that the extract, of which a copy is now sent, is authentic.
                            It boldly avows the authority and the activity of the insurgents at
                            Richmond for the building of armed steam-rams in France and Great
                            Britain, on their account, with their money, and for the very purpose of
                            making war against the United States from French and British ports.</p>
                        <p>Secondly. It avows with equal directness and boldness the sending of
                            twenty-seven so-called commissioned officers and forty reliable petty
                            officers from Richmond to the British North American provinces, to
                            organize and despatch from thence a naval expedition to make war against
                            the United States on the great lakes, which expedition they confess has
                            been defeated through the vigilance of the provincial authorities.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly. In connexion with the two avowals, the same conspirator says
                            that he has sent another cruiser with instructions which will shortly be
                            made apparent to the enemies of the insurgents near home. This may
                            possibly mean instructions to send the Rappahannock and other vessels
                            for armament into French waters, and it may mean to seize vessels on the
                            high seas under their officers, and arm these captured ships in neutral
                            waters, or with lighters from neutral ports.</p>
                        <p>You will lose no time in laying this information before Mr. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys, and you will submit to him, as the opinion of this government,
                            that the proof thus presented is sufficient to remove all lingering
                            doubt concerning the objects, character, and designs of the builders of
                            the steam rams in France, which have lately been indicated to his
                            Imperial Majesty’s government.</p>
                        <p>Secondly. In the opinion of this government, a toleration by the French
                            government of the proceedings of the pirates, thus avowed by the
                            insurgents, after the knowledge of them now imparted to M. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys, would not be neutrality, but would be a permission to the
                            enemies of the United States to make war against them from the coasts of
                            France.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly. It is the opinion of this government that persons pursuing these
                            now avowed practices in France are not entitled, after the knowledge
                            communicated, to reside there without restraint, upon the plea of
                            freedom to political exiles, but that they ought to be regarded as
                            belligerents unlawfully perverting their shelter to the commission of
                            crimes, not only against the people of the United States, but against
                            the dignity and honor of the French empire.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly. In the opinion of this government, it is a deliberate design of
                            the insurgents, through these practices now avowed, to involve France in
                            a war with the United States. At least, these practices tend directly to
                            that nefarious end, for they tend to exasperate the people of the United
                            States and the people of France against each other, and to provoke
                            citizens of the United States in every form to pursue their enemies
                            operating from French ports and seeking refuge in them within the
                            jurisdiction of France, or to adopt some other form of retaliation.</p>
                        <p>The President is well assured that the government of the Emperor will
                            reprobate and condemn this design, and desire to defeat it as earnestly
                            and sincerely as this government can do. I regret that beyond this
                            temperate use of remonstrance and appeal to the French government, which
                            we have thus far presented, to prevent the designs, we are unable to
                            suggest any remedy for the evils complained of that would be effective,
                            and at the same time consistent with the policy which France has
                            hitherto pursued towards the insurgents who <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9"
                                facs="0029"/>have made this lamentable civil war. On the contrary,
                            the very abuse of the flag, ports, and waters of France is resorted to
                            by the insurgents as a means to make themselves, through the involuntary
                            toleration of the French government, the naval belligerent which that
                            government acknowledges them to be, and which, in fact, they are not nor
                            cannot be without flag, ports, ships, or waters in the region which they
                            falsely claim to defend.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, it must be manifest that the unlawful proceedings of
                            the insurgents ought to be brought to an end; and it is respectfully
                            submitted that, for this purpose, the Emperor’s government will need to
                            adopt some means beyond any that it has yet put into execution.</p>
                        <p>After having submitted the foregoing facts and suggestions to M. Drouyn
                            l’Huys, on the part of this government, in a spirit of cordial esteem,
                            and in a manner perfectly respectful, you will, for the present, leave
                            them to his just consideration.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of December 4, No. 383, has
                            been received.</p>
                        <p>You will express to M. Drouyn de l’Huys my acknowledgments for the
                            information he has given you in regard to the application which was made
                            to the imperial government by the British government to agree with them
                            in treating as valid an alleged condemnation and sale of a vessel
                            captured and claimed as a prize by the insurgents. I am very thankful
                            that the French government declined the proposition. The insurgents have
                            never made a lawful prize, and never lawfully condemned a vessel. I
                            think I hazard little in saying, that under no circumstances is the
                            government of the United States likely to recognize any capture or any
                            condemnation they may make or procure.</p>
                        <p>I thank you for the copy of M. Fould’s report. It is a very lucid
                            exposition of French finance, and reflects great credit upon her
                            minister of finance. France may well be congratulated upon her success
                            in the great policy of internal improvement.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Ministre</hi>: Although it may be,
                                and perhaps is, an act of supererogation, I beg to enclose to your
                                excellency copies of the affidavits of Richard Spendiff, George
                                Hill, and James Nunn, persons recently employed upon the confederate
                                vessel now called the Rappahannock, lying in the port of Calais.
                                These affidavits are merely cumulative evidence showing the fact,
                                which has not, I believe, been disputed, that this vessel, in
                                violation of the principle of international law and the Emperor’s
                                proclamation, is being equipped and fitted out in that port to
                                cruise against the commerce of the United States. This vessel is yet
                                within the jurisdiction of France, and may be justly detained. If,
                                under the circumstances, she be permitted to complete her equipment,
                                and then to depart, I respectfully submit that the French government
                                will be justly responsible for all damages done by her. Is it not
                                desirable to avoid, if possible, all fair ground for future
                                reclamation?</p>
                            <p>I take this opportunity to renew to your excellency the assurances of
                                high regard with which I have the honor to be, your excellency’s

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I enclose a slip cut from a newspaper
                            recently published here, the substance of which has made the round of
                            the French and English journals, and will doubtless be recopied in the
                            journals of the United States. Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys says he knows
                            nothing of it, and has never heard of the pretended envoy therein
                            referred to. He says, further, that should he find that any such person
                            has arrived, he will not fail to let me know it; but at present he
                            supposes the paragraph to be like all the other “trash” of this
                            character which is put in circulation.</p>
                        <p>I referred in this connexion to the supposed outline or schedule of a
                            treaty alleged to have been agreed upon, some two or three months since,
                            between his Majesty and the rebel agents abroad, and communicated to you
                            by Mr. Morse, our consul at London; a copy of whose communication was
                            enclosed to me in your confidential despatch, No. 438.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys says there is no truth whatever in this statement,
                            and that the Emperor has no such negotiation whatever with the
                            confederates on foot.</p>

                            <p>M. Supervielle, who has just arrived in Paris, in the character of
                                special envoy from the Confederate States, is a Frenchman by birth,
                                who was formerly an advocate in the south of France, somewhere near
                                Bordeaux. He has been living in Texas for the last seventeen years,
                                and is now a naturalized American. He got away from Matamoras on
                                board a French ship-of-war, which the admiral <pb n="11"
                                    xml:id="pg_11" facs="0031"/>lent him to go to Vera Cruz, where
                                he embarked in the transatlantic packet Florida for St. Nazairé. He
                                is said to have a mission to notify to the French government the
                                recognition by the Confederate States of the “empire” of Mexico, and
                                also to try to persuade Napoleon III to recognize the south in
                                return.</p>

                            of a note recently sent to Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys in reference to the
                            rebel vessel called the Rappahannock, lying at Calais, I now beg to
                            enclose to you a translation of Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys ’s reply. I should
                            add that, in the course of conversation had with him yesterday, he
                            admitted that this vessel was, in his judgment, an exceptional case,
                            inasmuch as she was not driven in by stress of weather or necessity, but
                            came voluntarily, to complete her equipment; and that, in this respect,
                            her case was unlike the case of either the Florida or Greorgia. He said,
                            further, that he understood the minister of marine agreed with him in
                            this view; but nothing has yet been done. I am daily expecting some
                            orders from the minister of marine, in reference to this vessel.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received the letters which you
                                have done me the honor to address me, dated the 4th, 12th, and 19th

                                taken care to give notice of them to the minister of marine, whose
                                information was still incomplete, and I await the result of the <pb

                                authorities are obliged to proceed, in order to judge of the
                                difference which you point out between the position of the vessel
                                and that of the Florida and of the Georgia. I think, indeed, with
                                you, that it is desirable to avoid giving an equitable base for
                                future reclamations. It is with this feeling that the government of
                                the Emperor has always been studious to act, and it will not depart
                                therefrom in this circumstance. I cannot, however, prevent myself
                                from causing you to remark, on this occasion, how regretable it is
                                that the same disposition with which the cabinet of Washington is,
                                without any doubt, animated, should not yet have assured the
                                indemnifications, so equitably due to so many French residents, for
                                injuries of all kinds, which they have suffered in the United
                                States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>Your despatch No. 445 apprises me of the fact of Mr. Evarts’s early
                            return to Europe. I can only say that it will give me pleasure to confer
                            with him in reference to any legal questions pending between us and this
                            government.</p>
                        <p>I have been much at a loss as to what course of action would be most
                            judicious in reference to the vessels now being built in the ports of
                            France, and am happy to know that you will take the responsibility of
                            directing it. In my last conversation with Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys he
                            informed me that Mr. Arman, the builder of these vessels, was seeking
                            purchasers for them other than the confederates, and that the minister
                            of marine did not think himself authorized, therefore, to prevent their
                            completion, although he would prevent their being armed, or delivered by
                            Arman to the confederates.</p>
                        <p>The completion of these vessels, or some of them, is being hurried on
                            with all possible despatch.</p>
                        <p>At a meeting of leading secessionists, held in Paris on Friday evening
                            last, one of the principal topics of the conference was as to the mode
                            of getting these vessels out of port. Another of the subjects of
                            conference was, as I am informed, the chance of procuring recognition by
                            France, in consideration of the transfer of Texas to that power.
                            Authority for making this transfer is, I am told, claimed by certain
                            parties representing the confederates here.</p>
                        <p>The diplomatic corps has again received notice from M. Drouyn de l’Huys
                            that he will not be able to receive, us to-day, on account of ill
                            health.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have just returned from the palace. The
                            Emperor had, to-day, the usual reception of the diplomatic corps, and
                            was addressed by the Pope’s Nuncio in its behalf, and made a short
                            address in reply.</p>

                        <p>There was nothing in his remarks of a special or marked character. After
                            reciprocating the salutations and kind wishes of the corps, he said, in
                            substance, that notwithstanding the difficulties which surrounded them
                            he trusted matters would be so conducted as to lead to and perpetuate a
                            policy of peace.</p>
                        <p>To me personally he said, “Your troubles are not so great as they were
                            this time last year;” and he added, that he trusted they might be ended
                            at no distant day.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You have probably seen the within
                            correspondence between Mr. Davis and the Pope before this; but as it is
                            translated and printed in the Moniteur of this morning, I herewith
                            enclose it to you.</p>
                        <p>The design of this quasi recognition of Mr. Davis, who is addressed as
                            “illustrious and honorable president,” is manifest. It is a last effort
                            to get up some feeling against the north among the Catholics, and to
                            use, perhaps, the influence of the Holy Father to stop his Irish
                            votaries from volunteering. I had learned some short time since that an
                            effort was being made to get up a correspondence for some such purpose,
                            and spoke to the Pope’s Nuncio here on the subject, but he attached no
                            importance to it, and did not, as he said, believe it. Of Mr. Slidell he
                            spoke as an entire stranger, saying he had never seen him but once in
                            his life, and then casually only.</p>
                        <p>The correspondence does not, it is true, amount to much, but it
                            illustrates the unceasing activity of the rebel chief in reaching for
                            aid to every possible source.</p>

                            <p>Most venerable chief of the Holy See and sovereign pontiff of the
                                Catholic, Apostolic and Roman church:</p>
                            <p>The letters which your Holiness has addressed to the venerable chiefs
                                of the Catholic clergy of New Orleans and New York have been
                                communicated to me, and I have read with emotion the terms in which
                                you have been pleased to express the deep sorrow caused you by the
                                carnage, the ruin, and the desolation, which are the consequences of
                                the war now waged by the government of the <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14"
                                    facs="0034"/>United States to the States and peoples who have
                                chosen me to preside over their government, in which letters you
                                command these chiefs and their clergy to exhort the people and the
                                authorities in the exercise of charity and the love of peace.</p>
                            <p>I am deeply sensible to the Christian charity and sympathy which have
                                inspired your Holiness in the reiterated appeal made to the
                                venerable clergy of the Catholic church, to induce it to use all its
                                authority in behalf of the restoration of peace and
                                tranquillity.</p>
                            <p>I therefore deem it my duty to express to your Holiness personally,
                                and in the name of the people of the Confederate States, that we are
                                deeply sensible of the sentiments of love and of Christian charity
                                which have guided your Holiness on this occasion, and to assure you
                                that this people, threatened, even within its very hearthstones, by
                                a cruel oppression and by a fearful carnage, desires now, as it has
                                always fervently desired it, the termination of this impious war;
                                that we have manifested in our prayers, addressed to our Heavenly
                                Father, the same sentiments as those with which your Holiness is
                                animated; that we do not wish any evil to our enemies; that we do
                                not covet any of their possessions; but that we only contend that
                                they may cease to desolate our country, to shed the blood of our
                                people, that they permit us to live in peace under the ægis of our
                                institutions and of our laws, which protect every one, not only in
                                the enjoyment of his temporal rights, but also in the free exercise
                                of his worship.</p>
                            <p>I therefore pray your Holiness to accept, on my part, and on that of
                                the people of the Confederate States, our sincere thanks for your
                                efforts in behalf of peace. May the Lord prolong the days of your
                                Holiness, and have you in His holy keeping.</p>

                                exhorted these venerable brothers to the end that, in their piety
                                and their episcopal solicitude, they should endeavor, with the most
                                ardent zeal, and in our name, to put an end to the fatal civil war
                                which has broken out in those countries, in order that the American
                                peoples should finally come to a common peace and concord, and to
                                love one another charitably.</p>
                            <p>It has been particularly agreeable to us to learn that you,
                                illustrious and honorable president, and these same peoples, are
                                animated with the same desires of peace and tranquillity which we
                                have, in our letters hereinbefore referred to, inculcated upon our
                                aforenamed venerable brothers. May it at the same time please God
                                that the other peoples of America, and their directing powers,
                                considering seriously how grave a civil war is, and how great are
                                the evils it entails, may be willing finally to listen to the
                                inspirations of a more calm spirit, and adopt resolutely the cause
                                of peace.</p>
                            <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0035"/>
                            <p>As to ourselves, we shall not cease to address the most fervent
                                prayers to the all-powerful God, that he may bestow upon all the
                                peoples of America a spirit of peace and charity, and that he may
                                withdraw them from the very great evils which afflict them.</p>
                            <p>We supplicate at the same time the good and merciful God to bestow
                                upon you the lights of His grace, and to attach you to us by a
                                perfect union.</p>

                            Thomas H. Dudley, esq., informs me that with a view to the successful

                            rams at Birkenhead for the insurgents, it is important to procure
                            evidence of the connexion of the house of Messieurs Bravay &amp; Co.
                            with the insurgents. I will therefore thank you to use your best

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of December 11, No. 384, is
                            the latest which has been received here, and an acknowledgment of it has
                            been delayed by reason of my short absence from this city.</p>
                        <p>Your proceedings in the case of the Rappahannock are approved.</p>
                        <p>I have communicated to the Secretary of the Navy the information you gave
                            me concerning the Florida and the Georgia. Mr. Mercier has returned to
                            France for the winter. I have reason to believe that he has left us with
                            kind and liberal sentiments towards the United States. Certainly he
                            bears with him the respect and good wishes of this government. The
                            beginning of our unhappy civil war found him in close and intimate
                            relations with the leaders of the insurrection. This could not well be a
                            cause of surprise or of reasonable complaint on the part of this
                            government, for those leaders were, until a very late hour in Mr.
                            Buchanan’s term, directors of the administration of this government
                            itself. We had no right to expect greater loyalty from a foreign
                            minister than was exhibited by the cabinet of Mr. Buchanan. It is
                            believed that Mr. Mercier has been slower than most of the
                            representatives of foreign states residing here in accepting the
                            conclusion that the Union would be saved from the appalling dangers with
                            which he has seen it combating. Nevertheless his bearing and his
                            interviews with the government are believed to have been frank and
                            honorable. He is therefore commended to your kind and respectful
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>He will inform you that just when the President had acceded to the wishes
                            of the French government for a permission to export the tobacco which it
                            has stored at Richmond, upon the express ground that it had been bought
                            and paid for before the blockade was laid upon the southern ports, it
                            was discovered that <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0036"/>the French
                            government had been in error as to the fact of the alleged early
                            purchase and payment so far as five or six thousand hogsheads of the
                            tobacco were concerned. On this mistake being brought to the knowledge
                            of the President, he at once consented to authorize the exportation of
                            the 1,500 hogsheads, which it was still understood had been bought and
                            paid for before the blockade, and said that he would review the subject
                            as to the 6,500 hogsheads which it would appear had not been thus early
                            purchased and paid for. When this decision was made known by Mr. Mercier
                            to Mr. Paul, the French agent in Richmond, that gentleman then for the
                            first time discovered, or at least made known the fact, that even the
                            1,500 hogsheads referred to were not paid for until after the blockade
                            was established. This statement became known to Mr. Mercier just when he
                            was on the eve of departing, and when I was at New York, and not at this
                            capital, so that it could not be made a subject of correspondence
                            between us. I therefore recommended to him, under the circumstances, to
                            submit the altered state of the case to M.Drouyn de l’Huys. This
                            government is satisfied that the imperial government is disposed to
                            practice not only strict neutrality in our civil war, but also to extend
                            to this government all the comity that shall be consistent with that
                            relation.</p>
                        <p>The President is therefore by no means inclined to insist rigorously on
                            the condition of its concession concerning the tobacco in question. At
                            the same time it is to be remembered that a waiver by Great Britain of a
                            right to object to the relaxation of the blockade, so as to permit the
                            exportation of this tobacco, was deemed necessary before those
                            concessions were made, and that Great Britain made the waiver upon the
                            direct application of the French government, and upon the express ground
                            that the tobacco involved had been actually bought and paid for before
                            the blockade was established. You will bring this important fact to the
                            recollection of Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys, who may, if he shall deem it
                            expedient, apply to her Majesty’s government for a renewal of its
                            original assent upon the now corrected state of facts. If the difficulty
                            which I have thus stated shall be removed, the President will reconsider
                            the case in the same spirit of liberality and comity towards France
                            which has governed the previous proceedings of this government.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p>Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys said that he and the minister of marine had already
                            consulted on the subject of the use of their ports, with a view to adopt
                            some general rules, as England had done, and it was probable that such
                            rules would be framed and notice of them given, but they were not yet
                            prepared.</p>
                        <p>I took occasion again to inform him that at least seventy persons had
                            recently been sent from England to ship on some one of the three vessels
                            now lying in French ports, and that a portion of these, at least, were
                            intended for the Rappahannock; that this vessel at least could not
                            claim, as the Florida did, a light to renew her crew while lying in a
                            neutral port, for, in point of fact, she brought no crew in. She was
                            sent over or brought over from the English side of the channel by
                            mechanics, engineers, and firemen, who were on board of her temporarily
                            only. Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys seems to agree with me altogether as to this
                            vessel, and says the minister of marine agrees with him, but they do
                            nothing. The vessel is not, however, ready to leave port, although I am
                            informed that the Florida and Georgia are ready. The Kearsarge is yet
                            off the port of Brest.</p>
                        <p>These vessels will be accompanied to sea, as is stated in public
                            journals, by a French ship-of-war, with the view, of course, to prevent
                            any violation of the rules of international law.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch No. 393 has been received.
                            It is hoped that the insurgent vessel Rappahannock will be arrested as
                            you anticipate.</p>
                        <p>The remarks of Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys in his note to you of the 23d ult.,
                            in regard to complainta of French subjects against the United States,
                            are somewhat surprising. Most of the claimants are believed to have been
                            residents of insurgent territory. France, by recognizing the insurgents
                            as belligerents, may be expected to have accepted all the responsibility
                            of that measure, and to be content to regard her subjects domiciled in
                            belligerent territory as identified with belligerents themselves. There
                            can be no question as to the applicability of this rule to domiciled
                            merchants, and the reasons for its applicability to that class seem to
                            be sufficient for it to embrace all aliens who reside in an enemy’s
                            country for the purpose of carrying on business of any kind. Waiving for
                            the present, however, any further consideration of this point, the fact
                            that we have long since proposed to the French government a convention
                            for the adjustment of the claims of their subjects, and that this
                            proposition is still pending, would seem to have made untimely reference
                            to the matter in connexion with the case of the Rappahannock. It will
                            also have been noticed that the President, in his last annual message,
                            has recommended the establishment of a special tribunal for the
                            settlement of claims of foreigners which have originated since the
                            commencement of the war in this country. It is expected that the measure
                            will receive full effect at the hands of Congress.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of December 25, No. 390, has
                            been received. In one of my late communications I informed you of a new
                            discovery that had occurred to delay the shipment of the tobacco of the
                            French government at Richmond. M. Mercier, whose arrival at Paris will
                            have anticipated this despatch, will, I trust, have made known to M.
                            Drouyn de l’Huys the singular difficulties in regard to the matter which
                            have arisen out of a misapprehension by all parties of an important fact
                            in regard to the time when the tobacco was purchased and paid for by the
                            French government. The discovery of this error is deemed to render a new
                            presentation of the question to her Britannic Majesty’s government
                            necessary. While this representation’s being made, I renew with pleasure
                            the assurance that the President remains favorably disposed upon the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have at length received from Mr. Drouyn
                            de l’Huys, a reply in reference to the Rappahannock, now at Calais.</p>
                        <p>It would seem that upon inquiries made by their own agents they are led
                            to believe that the visit of the Rappahannock was casual and of <hi
                                rend="italic">necessity,</hi> and that they feel constrained,
                            therefore, to treat this vessel like other vessels in distress only. I
                            am quite sure, from the facts in my possession, that she made her escape
                            from English waters by night, and came into the port of Calais in an
                            unfinished condition; that she is now using that neutral port for the
                            purpose of completing such equipment I think there is no doubt. From the
                            fact, too, that twelve or fourteen men were there waiting her arrival,
                            and, after a signal shown, attempted to get on board of her by a ruse,
                            it is evident that she was expected in that port. I am by no means
                            satisfied with the course of action which this government has adopted in
                            reference to these vessels, and more especially in reference to the
                            Rappahannock. I have already given them to understand that we shall
                            consider them responsible for all damages which may accrue to us by
                            reason of any future depredations committed by this vessel.</p>

                                him, as I have had the honor to inform you by my letter of the 23d
                                of last month, in regard to the stay at Calais of the vessel the
                                Rappahannock. It appears from it that this matter has already
                                attracted the attention of M. le Cte. de Chasseloup Laubat, and that
                                he had hastened to give the necessary orders that the captain of the
                                vessel referred to might be able solely to put it in a state of
                                navigability, and revictual with provisions and coal. It results
                                also from an inquiry which was entered into on the spot, that Calais
                                was not at all the port of destination of the Rappahannock when she
                                left the shores of England; that unforeseen accidents only led her
                                to take refuge in our waters, and that we could not under these
                                circumstances refuse her an asylum, any more than to any other
                                vessel placed in the same situation. This vessel has been, however,
                                and continues to be the object of special surveillance, and you
                                yourself will be satisfied with the care with which watch is kept
                                that no suspicious object be introduced on board, by reading the
                                report on this subject addressed to the department of the marine by
                                the competent local authority, and herewith annexed in copy. I will
                                add that M. le Cte. de Chasseloup Laubat, in limiting the facilities
                                accorded to the Rappahannock to what is demanded for the equipment
                                and seaworthiness of an ordinary vessel of commerce, has besides
                                given directions not to authorize her to prolong her stay at Calais,
                                so soon as she shall be in a state to go to sea.</p>
                            <p>Receive the assurances of the high consideration with which I have
                                the honor to be, sir, your very humble and very obedient

                                <p>Upon the receipt of the despatch of your excellency, I requested
                                    further information of the established inspector of the customs
                                    in regard to the Rappahannock. It appears from his answer that
                                    the information given to H. E. M. the minister of foreign
                                    affairs has considerably exaggerated the significance of the
                                    number of packages addressed in this port to the confederate
                                    steamer.</p>
                                <p>If the slightest attempt had been made to embark arms, munitions
                                    of war, or machines which might have been able to facilitate a
                                    transformation to the vessel, which has constantly been held in
                                    suspicion here, or to give to it the means of taking the
                                    offensive upon leaving Calais, severe measures would have been
                                    taken immediately, the Rappahannock detained, and orders
                                    requested without delay from your excellency, by means of the
                                    telegraph.</p>
                                <p>It is correct, M. le Ministre, that quite a large quantity of
                                    material and manufactured objects has been imported from
                                    England, but, with the exception of pipes, destined to replace
                                    the defective parts of the tubular boilers, and the screw, no
                                    object of essential interest to it has reached here for the
                                    confederate steamer. Moreover, was not the screw absolutely
                                    indispensable? The vessel was provided with two screws in
                                    bronze, but in the state of the engine they caused a trembling
                                    which greatly fatigued the rear of the vessel, and an <pb n="20"
                                        xml:id="pg_20" facs="0040"/>English manufacturer having
                                    proposed to Captain Campbell to take them in exchange for a
                                    single screw in cast-iron, he consented to this substitution,
                                    which even yet has not been made, although this propeller has
                                    been here for several weeks. The remainder of the packages
                                    contained some water-casks, utensils for the kitchen or intended
                                    for the steward’s room, cloth or linen intended to clothe the
                                    crew, wool, &amp;c., to mend the clothes, lace, blacking, signal
                                    flags, and not signal rockets; all objects, in fine, which
                                    permit this vessel to revictual as a vessel of commerce might
                                    do, by paying the duties, according to the usual tariffs for
                                    objects coming from abroad. If this vessel did not procure for
                                    herself here that which was wanting for its navigability, it
                                    could not go to sea, its masting particularly being so slightly
                                    supported that it would have fallen in the first rough
                                    weather.</p>
                                <p>As I have made known to your excellency, from the beginning of
                                    the confederate steamer’s stay here, I have concerted with M.
                                    the inspector of the customs upon the measures of “surveillance”
                                    of which this vessel ought to be the object. A visit on board
                                    was made by these gentlemen upon its arrival, and did not lead
                                    to the discovery of either arms or artillery. The sacks,
                                    &amp;c., of the sailors which have embarked have been examined.
                                    When the package arrives for the Rappahannock, it is visited by
                                    the custom-house officer upon landing, then escorted on board by
                                    an officer, or a sub-officer, and an officer of the customs.
                                    Besides, when this vessel shall be on the point of going to sea,
                                    a last search, as severe as possible, will be made on board. It
                                    has been for several weeks moored in the floating-dock, where
                                    officers of the customs are always on guard. This surveillance
                                    is sufficient to give security and to induce the assurance that
                                    upon leaving this port, where, it is true, it will be put in a
                                    good state of seaworthiness, the confederate vessel, whatever
                                    may be its name or its destination, will not be able to attack
                                    any vessel. Upon quitting Calais, this steamer, which put in
                                    there in a very defective state, although having on board
                                    elements almost sufficient to finish rendering her seaworthy,
                                    and even provisions in a sufficiently large quantity, will only
                                    be armed and equipped as a good vessel of commerce.</p>

                            and by the way of Vera Cruz, that Mr. J. H. Mansfield, the United States
                            consul at Tabasco, has been imprisoned by the authorities there.
                            Nothing, however, is officially known of the charges against him. Mr.
                            Lane, the consul at Vera Cruz, in a despatch of the 2d ultimo, an
                            extract from which is annexed, intimates that Mr. Mansfield has been
                            unmindful of the neutrality prescribed by his instructions and by his
                            duty as a consul of a power in amity with both Prance and Mexico. It is
                            desirable, however, that we should be informed of the reason for the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Adams has enclosed to me copies of
                            papers from England in reference to the Rappahannock, alluded to in your
                            despatch No. 454, and these papers I have generally, not always,
                            promptly submitted to the minister of foreign affairs, by whom they were
                            at once referred to the minister of marine.</p>
                        <p>These papers are principally affidavits, of which I presume you have
                            copies, forwarded from London. One or perhaps two of these affidavits I
                            have not thought important; I have felt, moreover, that if we continued
                            to put in papers merely cumulative, this government might at length say,
                            as the British government did in the case of the Alabama, that our case
                            was not made out until the last affidavit was filed. A copy of the
                            ship’s register sent from England, showing that the Victor yet stands
                            registered in the name of a private subject of Great Britain, I have not
                            used here, and for the simple reason that, if it proved anything, it was
                            against us, being evidence that the vessel in question belonged to an
                            English subject, and was not a confederate ship. Yet our whole claim for
                            interference upon the part of this government was predicated upon the
                            allegation that she was what she claimed to be, a confederate vessel. I
                            should add, too, that this government acts more on the report of its own
                            port officials than on affidavits or loose papers from other sources.
                            They do not, as on the other side of the channel, try a question of
                            international law as on some municipal statute, or like a case in the
                            quarter sessions.</p>
                        <p>It is evident that this government mean to admit the equipment of the
                            Rappahannock at Calais as a commercial ship, while they will take, as
                            they assure us, the utmost care that no armament or ammunition of any
                            kind shall be put on board of her; or, in other words, that she shall
                            not be in condition upon leaving that port to take the offensive against
                            us. My despatch No. 400, with the papers accompanying it, however,
                            explain their view on this subject very clearly. The vessels lately
                            undergoing repairs in French ports (the Georgia and Florida) are yet in
                            port, and the Kearsarge watching them. I enclose to you, herewith, the
                            copy of a letter written to the captain of the Kearsarge, which will
                            explain itself.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: I have been advised from London
                                that some seventy men have recently been sent from England to
                                France, and, as it is believed, for Brest. I presume that you have
                                already learned that the crew of this vessel has been filled up in
                                whole or in part, but I think it best to advise you of the above
                                fact. The journals are stating that the captain of the Florida has
                                given you notice that early in next month he will fight you off the
                                French coast. I do not attach much importance to these newspaper
                                statements, but should anything of the kind be in contemplation, and
                                you need additional men, do not permit anything heretofore written
                                to you to interfere with your enlisting them if they can be had. The
                                Georgia and Florida will probably join forces. The Rappahannock, now
                                at Calais, will not be permitted to take arms or ammunition aboard
                                before she sails. I have the express assurance of the government for
                                that.</p>
                            <p>What is the force of your vessel as compared with the aggregate force
                                of the Florida and Georgia? Have you received any such notice from
                                the Florida as intimated; and if so, do you consider it a serious
                                offer?</p>
                            <p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I deem it advisable to state to you the
                            following facts:</p>
                        <p>A man formerly in the employ of a loyal American commercial house in
                            Paris has lately returned from the south, where he has been engaged as a
                            blockade runner. He brought out 800 bales of cotton in September last
                            from Ocklockonnee river and bay. He says there is no blockade stationed
                            by our government, or was none on the 1st September last, between St.
                            Mark’s and Appalachicola. The river Ocklockonnee is navigable for
                            vessels of light draught for a long distance up. He says, further, that
                            cotton is brought down the Appalachicola from a point still higher up,
                            and is then carried by land across the country to the Ocklockonnee, from
                            which, coming down to its mouth, it is easily transshipped. Of course,
                            if cotton comes out that way, other things go in. If these facts are
                            true, a blockade should be stationed at the mouth of that river in
                            Ocklockonnee bay.</p>

                            addressed by Mr. Morse, our consul at London, to Mr. Putnam, our consul
                            at Havre, and, as a matter of security, immediately enclosed another

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Ministre</hi>: I have called at the
                                Foreign Office this morning in the hope of seeing your excellency,
                                but finding that you were out, and the hour of your return
                                uncertain, I think it most prudent to send you at once the copy of
                                extracts of a letter received this morning from Mr. Morse, our
                                consul at London. If the statement in these extracts be correct, I
                                am sure that the orders and intentions of this government as to the
                                reparations on the Florida, in port of Brest, have been violated,
                                and that such measures will at once be taken as will cancel the
                                wrong which has been done. Mr. Morse, the consul, writes to me,
                                under date of January 21, 1864, as follows:</p>
                            <p>“I have learned that the rebel privateers now in the French ports,
                                but more especially the Florida, are being carefully prepared to
                                capture the Kearsarge, if possible. Besides the 80-pounder Whitworth
                                rifled guns which the Florida had on board, she this week received
                                from an English yacht two steel Blakely rifled cannon, with
                                steel-pointed elongated shot to fit them. These guns were taken to
                                Dieppe from the English coast; I think from New Haven by steamer,
                                and put on board there, and taken thence to Brest by the yacht, and
                                put on board the Florida. I learn also that the Florida is very
                                heavily armed and manned. About one hundred and fifty have been sent
                                there from this country Within the last two or three weeks.”</p>
                            <p>Our consul adds in his letter to me: “I have also been informed, by a
                                person who saw them put on board, that gun-carriages have been
                                received on board the Rappahannock since arrival at Calais. They
                                were sent from this country. There are strong grounds for believing
                                that her guns have been received in the same way. The custom house
                                examinations at Calais afford no protection against arming her
                                there, Should a dozen or twenty cases be sent to the Rappahannock,
                                however large or heavy, only one will be opened, and that one will
                                be selected or made up for such official examination.”</p>
                            <p>I cannot but believe that our consul has in some way been deceived in
                                reference to this last statement; but the report, made from the
                                prefect or other authority at Calais, to the minister of marine,
                                enclosed to me with your excellency’s despatch, dated January 13,
                                1864, is so much at variance with my understanding, and the apparent
                                understanding of the British government, of the facts in reference
                                to the Rappahannock, that I respectfully submit the extract to your
                                consideration.</p>
                            <p>That vessel was a British ship-of-war, now claiming to be, not a mere
                                commercial vessel, but a confederate cruiser, which escaped by night
                                from Sheerness, without papers and without a crew, and, as admitted
                                by the report of the prefect or local authority above referred to,
                                with her masts even insecured. She could <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24"
                                    facs="0044"/>not be said to have suffered from stress of
                                weather, but came directly into the port of Calais, where men were
                                awaiting her arrival, and which men, I am informed, were
                                subsequently taken on board. It is admitted by all that she was not
                                in condition for sea. If she did not mean to come directly across
                                the channel into the port of Calais, she must have intended to come
                                into some other neighboring port; and this, so far as the principle
                                of law is concerned, would not vary the question; Since she has been
                                at Calais she has been engaged in shipping a crew, not for a vessel
                                of commerce, but for a vessel of war. The copies of affidavits which
                                I have heretofore submitted, and others, to wit, the affidavits of
                                Andrew McEune, Thomas Bryant, and William Fewson, which I now
                                enclose, prove this, I think, beyond a doubt. The rule which your
                                excellency informed me would be applied to the Florida, that she
                                will not be permitted to ship more men than she brought into port,
                                nor her fighting force increased, is not, I submit, being applied to
                                the Rappahannock, unless it be intended, which I can scarcely
                                suppose, to extend that rule so far as to say they may ship as many
                                sailors or fighting men as there were workhands or mechanics on
                                board, temporarily employed in making repairs; and even in that case
                                I know not how the account would stand.</p>
                            <p>Accept, sir, the assurances of high consideration with which I have
                                the honor to be, your excellency’s very obedient servant,</p>

                                    concern, that on this 17th day of December, A. D. 1863, before
                                    me, M. D. L. Lane, consul of the United States of America for
                                    the port of Vera Cruz, and the dependencies thereof, personally
                                    appeared José Wallace Smith, who being by me duly sworn
                                    according to law, did depose and say as follows:</p>
                                <p>When the French steamer under command of Commandant Conrad
                                    arrived at Minatitlan in February last, I was residing in that
                                    town and doing business there as a merchant. I was also regidor
                                    of the municipal body, enabled by a decree of the Mexican
                                    government to hold that position without infringement of my
                                    neutrality. The Mexican authorities, and most of the native
                                    inhabitants of the town, fled at the approach of the French, and
                                    I was left as the only neutral in office to represent the
                                    interests of the town, and if called upon, to deliver it over to
                                    the invading force. In this position I was recognized by
                                    Commandant Conrad, who, when I offered to resign my office,
                                    expressly desired me to retain it. The French did not occupy
                                    Minatitlan, but anchored their steamers at the mouth of the
                                    river, and for about two months I continued to act by request of
                                    the French, as temporarily in charge of the town, and was
                                    recognized as such by both parties, and used as a means of
                                    communicating with each other.</p>
                                <p>Some time in May, in consequence of a want of confidence
                                    manifested in me by the Mexican authorities, arising from my
                                    connexion with Commandant Conrad, I resigned my position—a
                                    Captain Sanchez of the Mexican army being appointed as military
                                    commandant. From that moment my connexion with the liberal
                                    parties, innocent as it was, completely and entirely ceased. In
                                    July a French force took possession of the town, and with it
                                    came, as French political agent and collector of customs, one of
                                    “Walker’s filibusters”—a man unfavorably known to the
                                    inhabitants, by name Bruno Van Natzmer, who indirectly assumed
                                    and concentrated in himself all civil authority, and to a great
                                    extent the military also. This was easily accomplished with the
                                    former, on account of their ignorance and timidity, and it was
                                    yielded to him by the latter, on account of what they supposed
                                    to be his local knowledge and the soundness of his intentions;
                                    and immediately a system of persecution and personal vengeance
                                    was inaugurated such as people never thought to witness in this
                                    nineteenth century.</p>
                                <p>About the beginning of September, while at the American consulate
                                    on business, I was grossly insulted and threatened by one John
                                    Hume, a resident of the town. Among other things, he said he had
                                    me completely in his power; <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26"
                                        facs="0046"/>that he could count upon the influence and
                                    assistance of the principal authorities to carry out his
                                    threats, which were by any and every means to have me sent away
                                    from Minatitlan or shot, and if the authorities failed him, he
                                    would visit the latter fate upon me himself. At this time
                                    Natzmer was living at Hume’s house, and on the most intimate
                                    terms with him, and there is every reason to believe they were
                                    conniving together against me, as will be proved by what took
                                    place afterwards.</p>
                                <p>A few days after the attack upon me at the consulate, Hume came
                                    to my house, and after repeating his insults and threats, struck
                                    me three times. I did not retaliate until he struck me the third
                                    time, and then I knocked, him down; as he was rising he drew a
                                    revolver, four barrels of which were loaded, cocked and snapped
                                    it at me, whereupon I again knocked him down; the same thing was
                                    three times repeated. Some people now came up and put an end to
                                    the struggle, and the police arriving conducted us both to jail,
                                    where I was placed in close confinement, and Hume in a few
                                    minutes released by order of Natzmer, addressing him through the
                                    judge.</p>
                                <p>Natzmer then informed the judge that it was the order of the
                                    commandant that an official communication should be drawn up,
                                    and addressed to the commandant, stating that Hume had gone to
                                    my house in a state of drunkenness, and I availed myself of the
                                    fact to endeavor to assassinate him. The judge refused to make
                                    such a statement, unless it was first substantiated as the
                                    result of an examination, conducted in conformity to law; and,
                                    notwithstanding Natzmer threatened to send him to Martinique,
                                    the judge, fortunately for me, was not intimidated. The case was
                                    fairly examined and I was released, and the sentence that would
                                    have been otherwise passed on Hume was only withheld through
                                    fear of Natzmer; thus the case remains on the archives, if they
                                    are not destroyed or tampered with—with the exception of what I
                                    state as having passed between Natzmer and the judge, which took
                                    place before witnesses who will readily bear evidence, when they
                                    dare speak without fear of Natzmer’s vengeance. His intentions
                                    towards me were thoroughly exposed, when he told the judge the
                                    next day, if he had done as he told him, by that time I should
                                    have been dispatched.</p>
                                <p>On the 18th Lieutenant Rollin came to my house with two armed
                                    soldiers, he ordered me to put on my hat and follow him, and I
                                    was conducted to the public jail, where I found Nicholas Lopes,
                                    Abino Garcia, Luis Carimon. We were kept some four days <hi
                                        rend="italic">incommunicado.</hi> On the evening of the
                                    fourth day the guard received an order from Lieutenant Rollin to
                                    take me out and shoot me at the sound of the morning bugle. I
                                    only knew the fate that was intended for me from the
                                    conversation of the guard, which I could not help overhearing,
                                    from their vicinity and the slight construction of the jail,
                                    which consisted of only one room. About fifteen minutes before
                                    the time appointed for my execution I heard that the order was
                                    suspended, but frequently during the next day I was led to
                                    believe, from the talk of the guard, that I had but a few hours
                                    to live.</p>
                                <p>On the afternoon of the fifth day we were marched off by a force
                                    under command of Lieutenant Rollin, and conducted to the river
                                    bank, where Natzmer was waiting with another force to receive
                                    us. We were placed by Natzmer on board the schooner Clara, put
                                    in the hold, our hands tied behind us, and our legs attached
                                    with iron rings to an iron bar of about five feet in length. To
                                    this bar five of us were chained. The hatches were then nailed
                                    down, and every aperture closed, except a hole about sixteen
                                    inches square, which had been sawed out of one of the hatches
                                    for the purpose of letting down provisions to us. From the
                                    extreme pain caused by the tightness of the bands and the
                                    constrained position of the arms, and all other physical and
                                    mental horrors of our frightful situation, I rapidly became
                                    delirious, and remained in that state eight or ten days. Under
                                    the influence of the delirium I used sometimes to <pb n="27"
                                        xml:id="pg_27" facs="0047"/>cry out of a night, when the
                                    corporal of the guard would come down and stamp upon me, and
                                    beat me in a manner that has left marks upon my body that I will
                                    carry to my grave. This was an occurrence of every night during
                                    my delirium. The necessities of nature had to be relieved as we
                                    lay, and the filth was sometimes left to accumulate for days; we
                                    had no mosquito bars; our food was eaten amidst an amount of
                                    filth and stench and pestilent atmosphere that must be
                                    experienced to conceive. The bands on our arms remained
                                    sometimes day and night; the effect on me has been to deprive me
                                    for life of the use of my left arm, and the right is seriously
                                    injured. In this state we remained thirty days—all except Albino
                                    Garcia, the previous collector of customs, about sixty-five
                                    years of age, who on the twenty-ninth day died from fever,
                                    superinduced by the horrors of our situation. The body, which
                                    was in a most filthy state, was allowed to remain from 8 a.m. to
                                    5 p m., still chained to the bar, and the hands still tied
                                    behind, and then it was drawn up by a rope passed under the arms
                                    like a sack of corn. During these dreadful thirty days Natzmer
                                    frequently came on board the vessel to see that his orders for
                                    our treatment were carried out, and it is to be presumed they
                                    were, for he gave no order for its alteration. On the 18th of
                                    November Natzmer came on board the schooner, and we were taken
                                    from the hold and delivered by him to the commander of the war
                                    steamer Fleche. I was in a wretched state of health—reduced in
                                    less than forty days from a strong, stout man to the merest
                                    shadow; and as I dictate this, unable to write myself, after
                                    nearly a month’s rest, I am still the mere wreck of what I was
                                    before, and my constitution has received a shock that time can
                                    never cure.</p>
                                <p>On the Fleche we were again placed in irons, and forced to keep a
                                    sitting posture under deck for about sixty hours, until we
                                    arrived at Vera Cruz, during which time we were denied all
                                    nourishment excepting musty biscuit and water.</p>
                                <p>From the day of my arrest to my arrival in Vera Cruz I was in
                                    utter ignorance of the nature of the accusations, if there were
                                    any, preferred against me, or upon what grounds I had been
                                    cruelly treated. On the 26th of November I was placed in custody
                                    of the United States consul at Vera Cruz, he becoming
                                    responsible for my appearance when called for, where I remained
                                    till December 14, when I was summoned before a court-martial,
                                    examined, and discharged. On the 17th I was notified, by the
                                    commandant superior at Vera Cruz, that I was at liberty to go to
                                    the United States. Wherefore the said appearer, in his own name,
                                    hath declared to protest, as by these presents I, the said
                                    consul, at his special instance and request, do publicly and
                                    solemnly protest against the said Natzmer, as French agent and
                                    collector of the port of Minatitlan, against the French
                                    government, against the French commander of the French forces,
                                    on land and water, at Minatitlan and Vera Cruz, ruling in the
                                    name of France, against all and every person and persons,
                                    against all authorities and things, that have in any way
                                    occasioned or permitted my arrest, imprisonment, and cruel
                                    treatment, holding each and all of them, and every matter,
                                    cause, or things concerned, liable and responsible for all
                                    costs, losses, damages, charges, and expenses already suffered,
                                    or that may be hereafter suffered, in my health or property, in
                                    any manner, shape, or form, on account of my said arrest and
                                    imprisonment and cruel treatment.</p>
                                <p>This done and protested at Vera Cruz the day and year first above
                                    written. In testimony whereof the said José W. Smith has
                                    hereunto subscribed his name, and I, the said consul, have
                                    affixed my hand and seal of office.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch of January 15, No. 400. We learn from it the
                            determination of the French government to permit the Rappahannock to be
                            completed and prepared for sea, though not armed at Calais.</p>
                        <p>You have already anticipated the disappointment and regret which this
                            decision has produced here, when we regard the evidence that has been
                            furnished to M. Drouyn de l’Huys as conclusive that she is a fugitive
                            pirate preparing for the devastation of our national commerce.</p>
                        <p>Your proceedings in giving notice to the French government that the
                            United States will feel themselves entitled and obliged to look to that
                            government for indemnity for the injuries she may produce is approved.
                            It will be necessary now that you proceed one step further, and inform
                            M. Drouyn de l’Huys that this decision of the French government,
                            co-operating with other causes, will be a trial of the friendship of
                            this country towards France, for which, after the protests that you have
                            made, not this government, but that of the Emperor, will be
                            responsible.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday information was laid before me of a design of an adventurous
                            party, now beyond our jurisdiction, to obtain letters of marque from the
                            republican government of Mexico, to harass the commerce of France. This
                            government is constantly called upon to give leave for the conveyance of
                            arms into Mexico for the use of the Mexican authorities in the war with
                            France. It stands firmly and faithfully upon its neutrality, but in
                            doing this it wounds popular sympathies which no human power could
                            repress. The Emperor’s government has had abundant occasion to observe
                            that the Executive of the United States has practiced prudence and
                            forbearance in their relations with the maritime powers which were not
                            expected from a government being so popular in its form as ours, because
                            it seemed impossible. Is it not inexpedient for the government of France
                            to continue indulgence towards our enemies such as we wholly refused to
                            her enemies? The President thinks that you should invite Mr. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys to bestow serious consideration upon the subject.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Ministre</hi>: I have just received
                                information from our consular agent at Calais that the confederate
                                war vessel Rappahannock has completed her repairs and equipment, and
                                is about to leave that port; and he further says that it appears by
                                a shipping gazette that a ship has gone out from the Thames laden
                                with munitions of all kinds for the Rappahannock. If this be true,
                                (and it is probable,) its effect upon the public mind of my country,
                                and the view likely to be taken of it by my government, must be
                                obvious. The Rappahannock is a confederate cruiser, and not a vessel
                                of commerce. To equip her in one neutral port as such, when it is
                                well understood she is to be immediately supplied from another
                                neutral port with arms to prey upon our commerce, is, I submit, to
                                aid directly in the principal wrong. The ports of England and
                                France, alternating in the character of their aid, might in this way
                                be made the easy means or base of military operations against us. It
                                is perfectly certain that the United States government will never
                                acquiesce in the justice or legality of such proceedings. And I now,
                                with great respect, give formal notice that reclamation will be made
                                in due time for all damages which shall be done by the Rappahannock
                                to our commerce, in case she be permitted under the circumstances to
                                go to sea.</p>
                            <p>Accept, sir, the assurance of high consideration with which I have
                                the honor to be, your excellency’s very obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I saw Mr. Mercier again recently, and he
                            requested me to assure you, in his name, that all was right here in
                            reference to our government. I told him at once that such was the
                            assurance given me, but that I was not at all satisfied with the action
                            of this government in regard to the rebel ships in their ports, and more
                            especially in reference to the Rappahannock; that I could see no
                            principle of law by which it could be justified. He only said, that he
                            was assured that they would permit nothing to be done except such
                            repairs as might be placed on a ship of commerce. In a conversation had
                            last evening with the Emperor at the palace, he referred to my recent
                            communication on the subject of the Rappahannock to M. Drouyn de l’Huys.
                            He assured me that they would carefully <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30"
                                facs="0050"/>consider the subject, and were disposed to go no
                            further than the principles of international law required. In reply I
                            told him that I had been explicit in my statements about the aid given
                            to these vessels, more especially to the Rappahannock, because it was a
                            subject upon which my country was very sensitive. That our government
                            and people could not but feel keenly when they saw their commerce swept
                            from the seas by vessels thus equipped and manned in foreign and neutral
                            ports.</p>
                        <p>Upon meeting M. Drouyn de l’Huys yesterday, he said, alluding to my
                            despatch to him of the 2d instant as to the Rappahannock, (a copy of
                            which was enclosed to you,) “You send me big words.” I answered, “I send
                            you no unkind ones.” He said, “No, he did not so receive them.” I told
                            him it was better, on certain occasions, to deal with entire frankness,
                            and this was one of them, to which he assented. He then added that, as
                            respects the Rappahannock, which had come into port in an unfinished
                            condition, &amp;c., and not from stress of weather, he agreed with me,
                            in the general view I had taken, that she was not entitled to the
                            privileges of vessels driven in from sea by distress, and he said that
                            he had informed the minister of marine that such was his opinion; that
                            he had sent him a copy of my last note as to the Rappahannock, and asked
                            what answer he should give to it, but as yet had received no reply.</p>
                        <p>He then spoke again of adopting the restrictions in force in the English
                            ports, with the single exception of that which applies to coal, which
                            England, possessing it herself in great abundance, treated in her orders
                            as contraband of war, but France, having little of it, did not wish to
                            commit herself to that point. I endeavored, in this connexion, to induce
                            him to reconsider the question of their grant to the rebels of
                            belligerent rights, and to have their ports closed altogether against
                            them. He again said, they could not do this; but the troubles growing
                            out of this grant had been such that they would not again recognize any
                            people as belligerents, without acknowledging them as a government.
                            Referring again to the reception and aid given to the rebel vessels in
                            the French ports, I asked his excellency if he had carefully examined
                            the despatch which France and England sent to us at the beginning of the
                            Crimean war, in which they express the hope “that the government of the
                            United States will, in a spirit of just reciprocity give orders that no
                            privateer under Russian colors shall be equipped or victualled,”
                            &amp;c., in our ports. He said he had, and added, with a smile, that
                            that despatch went very far! In other words, it went further, as I
                            understood him to imply, though he did not say so, than France was
                            willing to go now. You will recollect that my despatch to M. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys, dated November 6, 1863, enclosing to him a copy of the despatch
                            to us from England and France, with certain comments of my own, which
                            you have been pleased so heartily to approve, has never before been
                            acknowledged, or answered, and the time that has now passed, in
                            connexion with the above remark, (that it, meaning their despatch, went
                            very far,) induce me to believe, that the French government does not
                            mean to give any <hi rend="italic">written</hi> reply to my
                            communication. This is always the most convenient, and perhaps the most
                            judicious mode of treating a point which one does not mean to yield, and
                            yet cannot conveniently answer.</p>
                        <p>M. Drouyn de l’Huys told me yesterday, that Armn (the builder of those
                            iron-clad rams for the confederates at Bordeaux) had just informed him
                            that he had sold them to the Danish government, but before he, M. Drouyn
                            de l’Huys, acted upon that assumption, this government would have the
                            best and most satisfactory evidence of the correctness of this
                            statement. At present he does not consider the statement of the fact to
                            me as official, but says he will make it so as soon as he shall receive
                            the necessary proof. In the mean time I shall write to Mr. Wood, our
                            minister at Copenhagen, to get the facts in an authentic shape.</p>

                                following.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Soon after the commencement of the
                                American war the Yankees resorted to the trick of getting up
                                fac-similes of Richmond papers in type, paper, and size, of copying
                                their advertisements, and then filling up with reading matter of
                                northern manufacture. These papers were then put into the mails,
                                received, copied from, and circulated without suspicion as southern
                                utterances. The English press is now the victim of another trick of
                                the same sort. A document copied from the northern papers is now
                                going the rounds of the continental and English press, which
                                purports to be the official report of Mr. Mallory, the confederate
                                secretary of the navy, to the congress in Richmond. It is a
                                take-in—it bears internal evidence of a hoax; and I know many of its
                                statements to be false. Please, therefore, assure your readers that
                                no such document has ever been uttered by the secretary of the
                                confederate navy, and so help me “to nail to the counter” the
                                spurious thing also.</p>

                                of the new French loan:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">“Sire</hi>: I have the honor to submit to you
                                the results of the public subscription to the loan of 300,000,000,
                                authorized by the law of 30th December, 1863. The price of emission
                                of the three per cent. rente was fixed by the decree of 12th January
                                at 66 francs 30 centimes, with interest running from 1st January,
                                payable in ten equal instalments, the last falling due on 21st
                                November next. To realize the 300,000,000 and the 15,000,000
                                required for discount and dividends during 1864, it was necessary to
                                issue 14,253,393 francs of rente. The subscription was opened on
                                Monday the 18th, and closed on Monday 25th. The subscriptions
                                amounted to 219,321,536 francs of rente, by 542,061 subscribers, of
                                whom 134, 105 are at Paris and 407,956 in the departments. Although
                                the administration has still some returns to receive, the figures
                                which I now place before your Majesty will not be materially
                                modified, The subscription of six francs of rente, declared
                                irreducible, amount to 2,409,366 francs. In conformity with article
                                4, of the regulations of 12th January, the subscriptions which, in
                                consequence of the proportional reduction, would have been brought
                                below six francs of rente are admitted for that sum. In this
                                category are included demands of from 10 francs to 120 francs of
                                rente. They represent a sum of 3,372,390 francs of rente, demanded
                                by 118,830 persons, and figure in the repartition for 712,980 francs
                                of rente; making the total of irreducible rente 3,122,346 francs,
                                which reduces to 11,131,047 francs, the rente to be allotted to the
                                other subscriptions. Each subscriber will therefore be entitled to 5
                                francs 41 centimes of rente for every 100 francs of rente he has
                                demanded. At the moment of issuing the loan, the high rate of
                                interest and the restrictions which the Bank of France had deemed
                                advisable to impose on its advances on securities decided me to
                                admit, concurrently with specie and for important subscriptions, the
                                direct deposit, as a guarantee, of rente on the state and of
                                treasury bonds. Notwitstanding this facility, the sums actually paid
                                in have amounted to 230,000,000. A more considerable sum withdrawn
                                from circulation would have embarrassed the movement of affairs. In
                                order to diminish the effects of a too great concentration of
                                capital, I have authorized, from the 26th January, the reimbursement
                                of nine-tenths of the sums paid in by subscribers for 3,000 francs
                                of rente and upwards. The definitive liquidation of each
                                subscription will not be terminated until about the 13th of
                                February. At that date, the provisional receipts will be exchanged
                                for negotiable loan certificates. <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33"
                                    facs="0053"/>The treasury will reimburse at the same time the
                                sums paid in excess of the first tenth of the loan to the subscriber
                                who may not prefer to avail themselves of the right granted them, by
                                article 8 of the regulations of 12th of January, of applying that
                                excess to ulterior instalments. The resources which the loan has
                                procured for the treasury are more than sufficient, to assure the
                                public services and the successive reduction of the treasury bonds
                                in circulation. They also permit me, in conformity with article 7 of
                                my regulations, to suspend, from this day, the faculty of paying by
                                anticipation the instalments of the loan before they fall due. The
                                promptitude with which the country has responded to the appeal made
                                to it is a further proof of its confidence in the Emperor’s
                                government, and of the universal feeling of security in the credit
                                of France.</p>

                            despatch No. 455, I have called M. Drouyn de l’Huys ’s attention to the
                            fact that our government has proposed a convention for the settlement of
                            all claims of French citizens, and that the President in his last
                            message had recommended the establishment of a special tribunal for the
                            settlement of all claims of foreigners which have originated since the
                            commencement of the war, and which it was expected Congress would carry
                            into effect. M. Drouyn de l’Huys said that these matters had not escaped
                            his notice, but he did not see how such tribunals were to get
                            jurisdiction of these questions in respect to foreigners, but he would
                            make a memorandum of the points and consider them further.</p>
                        <p>As I know nothing of the details of the proposed measures, I could, of

                            l’Huys, on Thursday last, he handed to me the memorandum of a contract,
                            said to have been entered into between the Juarist authorities of the
                            state of Tamaulipas and the federal <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34"
                                facs="0054"/>authorities of the United States, in virtue of which
                            the latter agreed to furnish a certain quantity of arms and munitions of
                            war in return for delivery to them of many thousand Mexican mules. I
                            herewith send you a translation of this memorandum, which is without
                            signatures. Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys said he found the memorandum on his
                            table, without recollecting exactly whence it came, and therefore called
                            my attention to it. I told him that I had no knowledge on the subject,
                            but from the orders which had been issued by my government forbidding
                            the supply of arms to either belligerent in Mexico, and the fact that we
                            needed arms ourselves, as I supposed, even more than mules, I did not
                            believe such contract had been made. I promised, however, to take the
                            memorandum, and call your attention to it, as I now do.</p>

                            Georgia, and Rappahannock. It appears, however, from your note to Mr.
                            Drouyn de l’Huys of <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0055"/>the 22d
                            ultimo, that you had anticipated, in respect to the Florida at least,
                            the instructions adverted to. Our own law, as you are aware, forbids not
                            only the fitting out and arming in our ports of vessels to make war on a
                            country with which we may be at peace, but also prohibits any
                            augmentation of the armament of a foreign belligerent in a United States
                            port. We have a right to expect the same prohibition in French ports
                            against insurgent vessels. There must necessarily be some anxiety here
                            upon this subject until the determination of the French government can
                            be known.</p>

                            February 2, notifying him that, should the Rappahannock be permitted,
                            under the circumstances, to go to sea, the French government would be
                            considered justly responsible for all damages to our commerce, has had
                            immediate attention.</p>
                        <p>Herewith I enclose to you a translation of Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys ’s reply,
                            and the report of the minister of marine. They claim exemption from
                            responsibility, as it seems, upon the ground heretofore stated, that
                            nothing will be <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0056"/>supplied to this
                            vessel except what is necessary to her “navigability,” and that it is
                            the British government, as the minister of marine thinks, (from whose
                            waters, it is said, the armament is to come,) that should be held
                            answerable for damages. They promise, however, to investigate further as
                            to the condition in which this vessel left the English ports and entered
                            Calais. It is but just to Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys to say that when he
                            assented to the general view that I had expressed that this vessel was
                            not entitled to claim the aid and reparations which are extended of
                            right to national vessels driven into port by stress of weather, his
                            opinions and views were based on the facts as he and I then understood
                            them. Those facts, I have no doubt, were then understood by us
                            correctly; but some question would seem to be made on this subject by
                            the minister of marine. I do not think the government can at all justify
                            its action in equipping this vessel on the facts as they actually exist.
                            It is not only a violation of the principles of international law, but a
                            direct violation of the Emperor’s proclamation of neutrality made in
                            1861.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received the letter which you
                                did me the honor to write to me on the subject of the injuries which
                                the vessel Rappahannock might cause to the federal commerce upon its
                                departure from Calais. I have made it my duty, in consequence, to
                                again call the attention of M. the minister of marine to the
                                preparations of the confederate vessel, and I hasten to send you
                                herewith a copy of his answer. It results from it, as you will be
                                able to convince yourself, that the Rappahannock has not ceased to
                                be the object of the most active surveillance, and the numerous
                                visits made on board by M. the commissary of the maritime
                                inscription of Calais have enabled him to state that this vessel has
                                been able solely to procure itself what was wanting in respect to
                                its seaworthiness, but that it has received no object with a view to
                                an armament of war. The government of the Emperor could not then be
                                rendered responsible for the acts of aggression to which the
                                Rappahannock might afterwards devote itself against the federal
                                vessels, but which it would be powerless in its actual state to
                                commit against them on quitting our waters. If any doubts still
                                remain as to the conditions upon which this vessel left the shores
                                of England and took refuge at Calais, an inquiry which is now being
                                prosecuted by the direction of M. the minister of the marine will
                                furnish in this respect the desirable explanations. I will have the
                                honor to inform you of the result as soon as it shall be known to

                                addressed to you by M. the minister of the United States at Paris,
                                in reference to the early departure from the port of Calais of the
                                confederate vessel the Rappahannock, and by which he makes known his
                                intention to attribute to us from the present movement
                                responsibility for the injuries this vessel might inflict upon the
                                federal commerce. Your excellency knows that the Rappahannock
                                entered into the port of Calais in a veritable state of
                                unseaworthiness, that we have not accorded to it any other
                                authorization than that of putting itself in condition to go to sea,
                                and that no other thing has been furnished to it, and always as a
                                commercial transaction (<hi rend="italic">par le commerce</hi>)
                                except what was absolutely indispensable to it in order that it
                                might navigate. I will add, in fine, that this vessel has been on
                                the part of the authorities of Calais the object of the most active
                                surveillance.</p>
                            <p>It appears, indeed, by a letter from M. the commissary of maritime
                                inscription, received this morning even, that a fourth visit has
                                yesterday been made on board, and according to the formal
                                declaration of M. the inspector of the customs, there has not been
                                in any shape an embarkment of objects with a view to an armament of
                                war.</p>
                            <p>I could not then, for my part, admit the pretension of Mr. Dayton of
                                wishing to impute to us the injury which the Rappahannock might
                                cause to the federal commerce after its departure from our waters.
                                This pretension is so much the more unsustainable, as this vessel
                                could not be available as a cruiser except in so far as it should be
                                furnished with arms, which it would not be able to procure for
                                itself upon our territory. So M. the minister of the United States,
                                who understands this very well, pretends that these are to be
                                delivered to it <hi rend="italic">in the open sea</hi> by an English
                                vessel—an act for which our responsibility cannot be engaged. It
                                would then be much rather to the government of her Britannic Majesty
                                that Mr. Dayton ought to address himself, since this delivery of
                                arms would constitute an act contrary to neutrality.</p>
                            <p>So in regard to what has passed in our waters, you will recognize,
                                Monsieur le Ministre and dear colleague, that our conduct has
                                continued in every respect, as well in regard to the Rappahannock as
                                the other confederate vessels, the Georgia and the Florida, and the
                                federal vessel Kearsarge, in the line of the strictest neutrality
                                traced out by the declaration of the 10th June, 1861, and that the
                                government of the Emperor could not in any form assume the
                                responsibility which the minister of the United States would wish to
                                put upon it.</p>

                            461, 465, 472, and 478, which relate to the case of Mr. Mansfield,
                            United States consul at Tabasco, I have now the honor to send you a copy
                            of a letter from him which has just been received at this department. As
                            the facts of this transaction gradually come to the knowledge of this
                            government it seems more and more a cause of surprise and pain that a
                            consul of the United States should be treated with the severity which
                            marks this case, whatever his offending might be. It would have been
                            only courteous to the United States, and for aught that we can see,
                            would have been perfectly consistent with the safety of the French army,
                            to prefer a complaint to this government against the consul, at the same
                            time sending him to the care of this government, if he was accused of
                            practices however hostile to the cause of the French.</p>
                        <p>You are expected to ask just explanations and redress.</p>

                            transaction, but have given them no instructions to exercise force.</p>

                        <p>I have already let you know that Congress and the people of this country
                            are very sensitive in regard to this subject, and that the French
                            government cannot reasonably expect their acquiescence in proceedings
                            which shall conflict with the engagements that the French government has
                            thus made. The sensibility I have described increases with every day’s
                            increasing evidence of the decline of the insurrection in the United
                            States. The mails which convey this despatch will carry to Europe
                            unmistakable demonstrations that the system of African slavery is about
                            to be abandoned by the partisans who have been hitherto its supporters
                            and advocates in the loyal region of the country. It may, however, be
                            necessary to refer you to a fact of at least equal significance. Slave
                            sales still occur in the insurgent States. They show that a so-called
                            prime slave commands in the market the net sum of $100 to $150 of gold,
                            or $150 to $200 currency of the United States. This is a reduction of
                            1,000 per cent. in the value of the slave since the war began. Of
                            course, slaves less useful, for purposes of labor, have depreciated in
                            the same ratio. The slaveholding States are, therefore, verging to the
                            point where slave property will become an incumbrance, and slavery an
                            object of disgust. It is to be remarked at the same time that other
                            kinds of property are not so depreciated. Horses, cattle, grain,
                            furniture, and, I believe, lands, are worth as much to-day in the
                            southern States as they ever were. It would seem to result from these
                            facts that the economical system of the free States (identical with the
                            economical system prevailing in all other civilized nations) is being
                            adopted in the south, and that land, not labor, is becoming the chief
                            investment of wealth there as elsewhere. When this change takes place,
                            all the motives of disunion perish. Revolutionary movements cannot be
                            permanently sustained by mere prejudice or passion without substantial
                            objects or interests.</p>
                        <p>The President thinks you have done very well in suggesting to M. Drouyn
                            de l’Huys the expediency of an abandonment of the special attitude of
                            toleration towards the insurrection—an attitude which has gained no
                            benefits to France, while it has been so deeply injurious to the United
                            States. I have presented this subject so often and so fully heretofore
                            that it cannot be necessary to enlarge upon it now. America is believed
                            to be about to regain the accustomed blessings of peace, while Europe
                            seems not unlikely to become a theatre of war. We would that the
                            European states may not in their future conflicts find themselves
                            embarrassed with unfraternal relations towards the States in this
                            continent. It would be worthy of France to lead the way in restoring
                            harmony and mutual confidence between the old and the new, the eastern
                            and the western nations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: My confidential despatch, No. 405,
                            informed you that Mr. Annan, of Bordeaux, had introduced an amendment to
                            the address of the Emperor advising his active interference in our
                            affairs, on which he was expected to speak.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>This would have brought out the whole history of the vessels which were
                            being built in France for the rebels. I wondered at the time, as I
                            informed you, that the friends of the government should permit such an
                            amendment to be brought forward in the existing condition of things. But
                            I think I have failed to inform you that this amendment was subsequently
                            withdrawn by the mover, probably at the instance of the government. The
                            effect of this withdrawal has been to deprive us of the most convenient
                            opportunity for ventilating this entire question. The presiding officer
                            of the Chamber of Deputies will not permit (as in Congress, when in
                            committee of the whole) a man to speak on anything. The very question
                            must here be under discussion, or the speaker is stopped. Had you
                            published <hi rend="italic">all the evidence</hi> in your diplomatic
                            correspondence, we might, perhaps, have got it into print from that
                            source; but, as it is now, we scarcely know how to get the facts fully
                            before the French public, but it must be done.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: A printed copy of the diplomatic
                            correspondence of last year has reached me. I do not see that there is
                            anything in the correspondence between us, as published, with which this
                            government can justly find fault.</p>
                        <p>The rebel ship Florida has, as you are doubtless aware, left Brest, and
                            will probably soon be heard of on the ocean destroying our commerce. The
                            United States sloop-of-war Kearsarge, which had lain off the roadstead
                            for a long time watching her, was absent when she left. The Kearsarge
                            had gone to Cadiz, where she yet is, for, as I have been informed, coal,
                            provisions, and repair of her boiler or machinery. Why these things were
                            not attended to while the Florida was laid up with her machinery out, I
                            do not know; but it would seem, from a letter just received from our
                            consular agent at Brest, of which I send you a translation, marked No.
                            1, that it was not likely she could have prevented the escape of the
                            Florida if she had yet been off that port.</p>
                        <p>The Rappahannock is still at Calais, and in want of engineers, firemen,
                            and a competent crew; but in other respects she is, I believe, ready for
                            sea. I send you the translation of a letter just received from our
                            consular agent at that port, marked No. 2, which will give you the last
                            news I have about this vessel.</p>
                        <p>The Georgia was at Cherbourg about a week ago. Since that I have had no
                            advices from her, but presume she is yet in port. She may, however, have
                            gone, as her repairs, I am informed, were completed some days since.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                                consular agent at Cherbourg, advising me that the Georgia left that
                                port last night. I immediately telegraphed our consular agent at
                                Cadiz to inform Captain Winslow, of the Kearsarge, of the departure
                                of both this vessel and the Florida.</p>

                                to expect, the Florida went to sea in the night of the 9th and 10th
                                instant.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday morning she was no longer at her anchorage. I might have
                                informed you of it, but as she had before several times got ready to
                                make trials, either inside or outside the roadstead, I wished to be
                                certain of her departure before announcing it to you. It is very
                                probable that she has escaped the Kearsarge. The passes of this
                                harbor are so numerous that a blockade, in order to be efficient,
                                would require the aid of an entire squadron. The presence of the
                                Kearsarge will, nevertheless, not have been useless. She will have
                                kept the Florida at anchor for several months, and this is
                                something.</p>
                            <p>If I learn anything positive as to the presence of the Kearsarge in
                                our parts I will write to Captain Winslow.</p>

                            both inclusive, are duly received.</p>
                        <p>No. 466, enclosing the copy of a despatch from Mr. Lane, United States
                            consul at Vera Cruz, and the protest of José Wallace Smith, referred to
                            therein, were immediately communicated by me to Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys.
                            These complaints, like that referred to in your No. 465, (the
                            imprisonment of Mr. Mansfield, our consul at Tabasco,) ha said must be
                            referred by him to the French authorities in Mexico before he could give
                            an answer. But he assured me these matters should be promptly
                            investigated. It will, of course, be some considerable time before a
                            report on these cases can be received from Mexico.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I yesterday communicated to Mr. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys the contents of your despatch No. 468, and I did this the more
                            readily as, in its main features, it was a reiteration from you of views
                            that I had individually already expressed to him. I read to him that
                            part of your despatch in which you state that the decision of the French
                            government in respect to the Rappahannock, co-operating with other
                            causes, will be a trial to the friendship of our country towards France,
                            for which, after the protests we have made, not our government, but “the
                            Emperor, will be responsible.” He said, in reply, that we must deal with
                            things as they were. That France having acknowledged the south as
                            belligerents, he could do nothing less than treat them as such. That,
                            keeping that position in view, the Florida and Georgia had been received
                            in their ports. That the Florida had been repaired, though little had
                            been done to the Georgia, and nothing had been done to either of these
                            vessels except what was essential to their “<hi rend="italic"
                                >navigability.</hi>” That their fighting powers had not been
                            improved, nor had a French seaman been permitted to embark on either of
                            them. That in respect to these vessels, therefore, he thought they had
                            kept within the limits of clear rules of international law. That in
                            respect to the Rappahannock, she had not yet been permitted to leave
                            port, nor would she be permitted to leave until his government, by a
                            most rigorous and careful examination, had satisfied itself that no rule
                            of law had been violated. She had been permitted to repair as a vessel
                            of commerce only, and if we anticipated that she was to be converted
                            into a ship-of-war by guns from England, it was against England, and not
                            France, we should complain; but if the fact turned out, as I insisted,
                            that she was no vessel of commerce, but a ship-of-war, then he admitted
                            that if she came into a French port, not by stress of weather, but
                            voluntarily to finish her equipment, and she were permitted to leave, it
                            would be a breach of the proclamation of neutrality published by the
                            Emperor; but the question of fact, he said, was yet in the course of
                            investigation. I repeated to him the evidence on this question, (a
                            summary of which will be found, by the way, in the first despatch I sent
                            to him on this subject, dated December 4th last.) He seemed to consider,
                            however, that I presented the question in some new lights, and said he
                            would again refer the matter to the minister of marine. The line of
                            distinction between what they might properly do and what they might not
                            was, he said, in his mind quite clear. If a war vessel came into their
                            ports from stress of weather, they were bound to let her repair damages,
                            adding nothing except such repairs to her fighting qualities; but if
                            such a vessel came into port in an unfinished condition, they could not
                            rightfully permit her to finish her equipment, for that would be to
                            shape a harmless log or mass of timber into a fighting ship. I told him
                            that he and I did not then differ, in this case, so much about the law
                            as about the fact, and I yet hoped that on the further investigation,
                            which he promised, this vessel might be stopped. I told him, further,
                            that it was reported to me that she had not been able to procure a crew;
                            that the men, as long as the vessel lay so convenient to the British
                            ports, deserted and returned to England, whence they came; that, as a
                            consequence, Captain Campbell had become discouraged, and had made up
                            his mind to go around to Cherbourg or Brest to complete his crew. That
                            two or three days ago two vessels laden with coal had come to Calais
                            from England, and they were now engaged in transshipping it preparatory
                            to the Rappahannock’s leaving port. He made a memorandum of the fact,
                            and said the French government had adopted the <hi rend="italic">English
                                rules</hi> on these subjects. I told him those rules would prevent
                            this vessel’s going into another French port for three months, but I did
                            not remember to have yet seen those rules published in the Moniteur. He
                            said they had <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0062"/>without doubt been
                            sent to the authorities at the several ports, and he, Mr. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys, had supposed they had been published. At all events, he and the
                            minister of marine had agreed that such rules should be enforced,
                            except, I think, as to the article of coal. These rules, fairly applied,
                            will diminish to some considerable extent the use of French ports by
                            these rebel ships.</p>
                        <p>I have this morning received a telegram from Captain Winslow, stating
                            that the Kearsarge is again at or off the port of Brest. M. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys says that he believes those iron-clads at Bordeaux are sold to a
                            neutral, but I receive information from Mr. Wood, our minister at
                            Copenhagen, that the minister of foreign affairs of Denmark says he does
                            not know, nor has he ever heard, of any negotiation for the purchase or
                            building for that country of any ships in France. M. Drouyn de l’Huys
                            tells me, and I do not doubt but that he has given notice to Mr. Arman
                            (the builder of the iron-clads, and the contractor for the four other
                            ships building for the confederates) that France must be relieved from
                            all trouble in reference to any of them, and Arman has promised him that
                            France shall be. He says that the four other vessels are building for
                            commerce, and that he can and will sell them to neutral parties. In the
                            mean time I can and will keep a sharp eye to the entire proceeding.</p>

                                from a despatch of Mr. Dayton of the 26th ultimo, relative to the
                                efforts that are to be made, according to rumor, by the
                                secessionists next spring, and expressing regret that of the great
                                number of our ships of war enough could not have been spared to look
                                after the small rebel cruisers now in French ports, &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>In connexion with the remarks of Mr. Dayton I may be permitted to
                                state that it is not the want of ships that prevents a more vigorous
                                pursuit and a more strict surveillance upon the movements of the
                                rebel cruisers at this time, but of <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43"

                                our seamen have (under the promise of large bounties and the refusal
                                to credit, in ordering the draft, to the respective localities those
                                who have entered the navy) enlisted in the army, and thus left us
                                without men to man our ships.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of February 5, No. 411, has
                            been received. It presents in a very clear and satisfactory manner the
                            present state of the debate which you are carrying on with the French
                            government concerning the Rappahannock, the iron-clads, and the attitude
                            of France in regard to the United States as a maritime power engaged in
                            suppressing an insurrection. These important questions have been so
                            fully considered in recent despatches that it only remains for me now to
                            approve the positions you have assumed in your recent communications
                            with M. Drouyn de l’Huys and with the Emperor. One by one the majestic
                            schemes of the insurgents come to naught. Two months ago a naval war
                            seemed to have been prepared to be waged against us simultaneously from
                            the British coasts and the shores of the British North American
                            provinces, extending from the straits of Bellisle to the islands in the
                            Carribean sea. Recent events seem to have exploded these views of a
                            comprehensive naval campaign. The Chesapeake is restored, and her
                            captors delivered to us as pirates. Still Great Britain and France
                            persist in regarding the insurgents as a naval belligerent. It is not
                            easy to see why the maritime powers persevere in derogating us from our
                            true position until we shall have re-established it by another costly
                            effort without incurring any obligations to them for their favor as
                            friendly states.</p>

                            received. M. F. Maury’s allegation that the report bearing the name of
                            S. R. Mallory is spurious does not adequately impeach that document. It
                            came to us in the same manner as the other pretended state papers of the
                            insurgents. It betrayed facts and designs afterwards fully revealed,
                            which, at the date of the papers, must have been known to the insurgent
                            leaders, and yet of which no person not in their councils could be
                            informed. The paper is characteristic of its assumed author. It has
                            circulated in this country two months, and its importance, in the views
                            of this government and of the country, has been fully indicated; yet it
                            has not been disavowed nor its authenticity been questioned here to the
                            knowledge of this <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0064"/>department. The
                            pretence that insurgent newspapers are similated here is purely absurd,
                            under the circumstances. The merely unauthorized denial of its
                            genuineness by M. F. Maury in London is deemed unworthy of
                            consideration.</p>

                            instant, you addressed to M. Drouyn de l’Huys against the anticipated
                            proceedings of the French government in permitting the Rappahannock to
                            depart upon her work of piracy against the extended commerce of the
                            United States. In making this protest you have anticipated and executed
                            in a very proper manner a recent instruction of this department, and
                            your proceeding is, therefore, fully approved. You will, of course, make
                            this approval known to M. Drouyn de l’Huys, and when doing so you will
                            say that the President deems it not unbecoming to express his profound
                            regret that a necessity for so serious a complaint has arisen in our
                            intercourse with France—an intercourse in which everything on our part
                            has been intended to be conducted in the spirit of an earnest and
                            sincere friendship— which is believed to have been hitherto equally
                            beneficial to both countries.</p>

                            agents at Calais and Brest that the adoption of the “English rules”
                            (excepting, I presume, as to the article of coal) has been notified to
                            the authorities at those ports, which notice having <pb n="45"

                            adoption of these rules.</p>
                        <p>By a letter just received from our consular agent at Calais, I am

                        <p>The Rappahannock is yet detained in the port of Calais. I yesterday

                            Charles Bennett, seaman, &amp;c., sent to me from England, showing,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of February 9, No. 419, has
                            been received. In this communication you mention that the Archduke
                            Maximilian, of Austria, is expected in Paris, and that circumstances may
                            arise in which it will be necessary for you either to attend or to
                            decline to attend ceremonies which may be observed in his honor as a
                            sovereign of Mexico, and you ask instructions. I have taken the
                            President’s directions upon the question. If the Archduke Maximilian
                            appears in Paris only in his character as an imperial prince of the
                            house of Hapsburg, you will be expected to be neither demonstrative nor
                            reserved in your deportment towards him. If he appears there with any
                            assumption of political authority or title in Mexico, you will entirely
                            refrain from intercourse with him. Should your proceedings become a
                            subject of inquiry or remark, you will be at liberty, in the exercise of
                            your own discretion, to say that this government, in view of its rights
                            and duties in the present conjuncture of its affairs, has prescribed
                            fixed rules to be observed, not only by this department, but by its
                            representatives in foreign countries. We acknowledge revolutions only by
                            direction of the President, upon full and mature consideration. Until
                            such regular authority for recognition, we do not hold formal or
                            informal communications with political agents or representatives of
                            revolutionary movements in countries with which we maintain diplomatic
                            intercourse.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of February 6, No. 418, has
                            been received, together with a copy of a memorandum which M. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys has placed in your hands.</p>
                        <p>That memorandum is as follows: It is affirmed that a contract has been
                            entered into between the Juarist authorities of the State of Tamaulipas
                            and the federal authorities, in virtue of which the latter were to
                            forward a certain quantity of arms and munitions of war in return for
                            the delivery of several thousands of mules.</p>
                        <p>You very rightly expressed to M. Drouyn de l’Huys a disbelief of the fact
                            stated in the paper I have recited. It is uncertain whether by the term
                            “federal authorities” is meant the government of the United States, or
                            only the agents of this government in the vicinity of Tamaulipas. If the
                            former is intended, then you are authorized at once to declare that the
                            allegation in the memorandum is without any foundation in fact. If the
                            other condition is to be assumed, you will in that case inform M. Drouyn
                            de l’Huys that, so far as the government, or any department of it, is
                            informed, or has any reason to believe, the allegation is entirely
                            untrue. That, if it were true, the proceedings would be in violation of
                            the instructions of this government, and would be denounced and
                            censured. Although no evidence of the allegation is presented, the
                            attention of the Secretary of War has been called to the subject and due
                            inquiries will be instituted.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen</hi>: By its declaration of the
                                    10th of June, 1861, inserted in the Moniteur, the Emperor’s
                                    government has made known the principles which serve as a basis
                                    to the nutrality it intended to observe in the war which
                                    ensanguines North America.</p>
                                <p>Since then, these principles have received their application as
                                    well in our colonies as in the ports of the mother country.</p>
                                <p>But the continuation of the war having led the belligerents to
                                    carry the theatre of maritime hostilities into the neighboring
                                    waters of the neutral states of Europe, and brought them to seek
                                    in our ports the means of repairs or of provisioning, the
                                    Emperor’s government has deemed it useful to remind you again of
                                    the rules to be observed in order to maintain its neutrality,
                                    conformably to public law and to the traditions of the French
                                    marine, and to determine consequently on the treatment which is
                                    to be applied without distinction of flag to the vessels of the
                                    belligerents.</p>
                                <p>You will therefore have to attend to the strict execution of the
                                    following regulations:</p>
                                <p>1st. No vessel-of-war or belligerent privateer will be allowed to
                                    stay more than twenty-four hours in a port of the empire or of
                                    the French colonies, or in the adjacent waters, except in the
                                    case of a forced putting-in on account of bad weather, of
                                    injuries, or of exhaustion of provisions, necessary to the
                                    safety of the voyage.</p>
                                <p>2d. In no case can a belligerent make use of a French port for a
                                    purpose of war, or for there supplying himself with arms or
                                    munitions of war, or for there executing, under pretext of
                                    repairs, works whose object is to increase his military
                                    power.</p>
                                <p>3d. There can only be furnished to a vessel-of-war or belligerent
                                    privateer the provisions, stores, and means of repair necessary
                                    for the subsistence of her crew and for the safety of her
                                    voyage.</p>
                                <p>4th. No vessel-of-war or belligerent privateer, allowed to take
                                    in provisions or to make repairs in a French port, can prolong
                                    her stay there beyond twenty-four hours after her supplies shall
                                    have been shipped and her repairs finished, except in the case
                                    hereinafter provided for.</p>
                                <p>5. When vessels-of-war, privateers, or merchant vessels of the
                                    two belligerent parties are found together in a French port,
                                    there shall be an interval of not less than twenty-four hours
                                    between the departure of any vessel of one of the belligerents

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatches Nos. 478, 479, 480, and
                            481, have been received.</p>
                        <p>I yesterday called the attention of Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys to the case of
                            Mr. Mansfield, United States consul at Tabasco, imprisoned by orders of
                            the French authorities at that place. I asked that he should be
                            discharged from imprisonment and be permitted to return to the United
                            States, and for explanations of the conduct of their authorities. I told
                            Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys, furthermore, that our government had been so much
                            surprised by the statement of the treatment their consul had received
                            that they had sent a ship-of-war to the port of Tobasco, not to use any
                            force, but to inquire on the spot as to the facts; that it was naturally
                            felt that it would have been but just to the United States that they
                            should have been notified of any complaint against their consul, and
                            they would certainly have dealt properly with him. Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys
                            said that such a notice to us would have been the usual form of
                            proceeding in an ordinary case, but there was nothing in the official
                            position of a consul which exempted him from the ordinary liability to
                            answer like any other citizen, and that he did not know, nor had he yet
                            been able to learn, what were the facts in the case of Mr. Mansfield. He
                            assured me that he had already written to Mexico, and would give an
                            answer at the earliest moment after receiving a reply. I suggested that
                            it would seem to me as probable that the facts of such a case had
                            already been reported; he said it was possible, though he knew of no
                            such report, but he would inquire of the department of marine. At all
                            events he assured me no unnecessary delay should occur in acting on the
                            subject.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In a conference with Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys
                            on yesterday, he said he had some notes on his table in reference to the
                            cases of the Florida and Georgia, which should have been sent to me
                            before; but these vessels having been gone from the French ports for
                            some time past, he now scarcely supposed it worth while to deliver them.
                            I at once said that I much preferred they should be delivered even now.
                            I preferred this because, as I told him, the action of this government
                            in these cases, and analogous cases, extended beyond the occasions which
                            gave rise to them; that France had been making rules of maritime law
                            which might, at no distant day, be applied to herself. I thought it
                            safest and best, therefore, for both parties, that a distinct
                            understanding of the grounds on which she had placed herself should
                            appear in and by her own written communication. Under these
                            circumstances he at once handed me the two written unsigned
                            communications, of which I herewith send you translations. The
                            Rappahannock is yet detained in the port of Calais, under the direction
                            of this government.</p>

                            <p>As soon as the confederate ship Florida, which had been forced to
                                take refuge in the port of Brest, was in a state to go to sea, M.
                                the maritime prefect, conformably to the instructions of the
                                government of the Emperor, signified to the captain of this vessel
                                that he was to withdraw from French waters within 24 hours. The
                                Florida, in consequence, left the night of the 10th February. During
                                her stay in the port of Brest the competent maritime authorities
                                have been careful that the rules of the strictest neutrality should
                                be observed in regard to her. In the matter of powder, of arms, and
                                of all that which constitutes, in a word, warlike armaments, the
                                precautions have been pushed as far as possible. M. the maritime
                                prefect, in order to avoid the incorrect statements which often
                                arise in similar cases, was not willing that the powder of the
                                Florida, which, according to the regulations, ought to be
                                disembarked before her entrance into the port, be deposited in the
                                magazines, it remained in the roadstead under the surveillance of a
                                French agent. The crew of the Florida was not completed, and
                                although, according to the captain, he wanted 45 men, whose presence
                                was necessary for the working of the ship, information collected
                                with the most scrupulous care authorizes us in saying that he has
                                made no attempt to recruit French citizens.</p>

                                <p>M. the maritime prefect of the port of Cherbourg has rendered an
                                    account to M. the minister of the marine of the causes which
                                    opposed the departure from Cherbourg of the confederate ship
                                    Georgia, whose repairs are now completed. The captain of this
                                    vessel having been, as the instructions of the government of the
                                    Emperor prescribe, summoned to leave within a delay of 24 hours,
                                    has made known that the desertion of a great number of the men
                                    of his crew, particularly engineers, appertaining to the service
                                    of the engines, rendered it absolutely impossible for him to go
                                    to sea. The presence of other engineers being in effect
                                    indispensable to insure the navigation of the Georgia, there was
                                    there a case of<hi rend="italic"> force-majeure,</hi> which
                                    prevented the injunction addressed to the captain of the
                                    confederate vessel from being immediately followed; but M. the
                                    maritime prefect will take care that he conforms to it so soon
                                    as he shall be in a condition to do so.</p>

                        <p>M. Drouyn de l’Huys informs me that there is nothing in agitation here
                            calculated to disturb the good relations between the United States and
                            France. He says that the archduke has not asked the Emperor to
                            acknowledge the south, nor does he believe he has had anything of the
                            kind in his mind. Certain English papers have been industriously
                            propagating this idea, but there is, he says, nothing in it. He informs
                            me that he believes certain English and French <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51"
                                facs="0071"/>capitalists, already interested in Mexican loans, will,
                            in the hope of saving a part, at least, of their existing investments,
                            make a moderate advance in addition, and that the archduke will, from
                            these sources, be able to raise a small loan to meet his existing wants;
                            but it seems to me this cannot carry him far unless France shall stand
                            security, or give other material aid.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have again referred, in conversation
                            with M. Drouyn de l’Huys, to the supposed negotiation reported by Mr.
                            Morse, United States consul at London, for the cession of Texas to
                            France for certain considerations. The supposed negotiation for the
                            cession of Texas M. Drouyn de l’Huys assured me is without the slightest
                            pretence of foundation. He said that France would not take Texas as a
                            gift, even if it were accompanied with a handsome douceur besides; that
                            she does not want it, and would not have it. That if the rumor were that
                            she were about to part with some far off or distant possession we might
                            give it some credence, but never while he was minister and his Majesty
                            Emperor need I trouble myself as to the truth of any report which looked
                            to the acquisition of distant territory. Their policy, he said, looked
                            directly in a contrary way. Whether this comports well with their
                            existing action in Mexico may, perhaps, admit of a doubt.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys informs me that in a
                            recent interview with Arman, the ship-builder at Bordeaux, he, Arman,
                            asssured him that not only the iron-clad vessels he was building at
                            Bordeaux but the other four vessels (two at Nantes and two at Bordeaux)
                            would certainly be disposed of to neutral governments in such manner as
                            to relieve France from any trouble or responsibility on the subject.
                            These vessels, I may add, are in the steady course of construction, the
                            work being constantly advanced upon them.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch of the 19th of February last, which treats
                            chiefly of your proceedings in the case of the Rappahannock; these
                            proceedings are approved.</p>
                        <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0072"/>
                        <p>Mr. Geofroy called upon me yesterday, and said that he was instructed to
                            speak with me upon that question. He repeated to me from M. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys the representations which he had received from you, and which
                            seem in conformity with the previous instructions of this department and
                            your own reports. Mr. Geofroy then expressed to me M. Drouyn de l’Huys’s
                            views upon the subject, with the reasoning upon which these views were
                            adopted.</p>
                        <p>These explanations did not differ in any material point from the
                            assertions of M. Drouyn de l’Huys upon the case as you have conveyed
                            them to me in your correspondence. In my reply I insisted upon the fact
                            that the Rappahannock is a ship-of-war, a pirate escaped from British
                            ports, and a fugitive from British justice, interposing to maintain the
                            laws of nations. I trust that the evidence you have presented to the
                            imperial government upon this point will be found satisfactory, as to
                            this government it seems conclusive. M. Drouyn de l’Huys says that if
                            the Rappahannock, after being released and getting afloat, shall receive
                            an armament from the British shores, and commence her depredations as as
                            pirate, that it would be Great Britain and not France against whom our
                            complaints should be prepared; but Great Britain did listen to our
                            complaints, and did make an earnest effort to prevent not only the
                            equipping, but also the escape of the Rappahannock from British waters.
                            Since she entered Calais without any change of character, it seems to us
                            that we have much the same claim on the imperial government to detain
                            her and defeat her criminal enterprise that we before had against Great
                            Britain. We think that this view of the subject cannot be deemed
                            remarkable, because by taking it we by necessary implication commit
                            ourselves to pursue towards other states the same just and friendly
                            policy which we are requiring from France.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>A pretended sale of rebel vessels to Denmark I have already reported to
                            you, but Mr. Wood, our minister at Copenhagen, writes me that the
                            minister of foreign affairs assured him there was no truth in this—at
                            least there was none at that time; and should anything be done there, it
                            will doubtless be promptly reported to me here. * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I had a long talk with Admiral de la Ronciere Le Noury, the person
                            holding the place in the marine department next after the minister
                            himself. He said that the Rappahannock was yet detained by the French
                            government; that the gates of the dock where this vessel lies having
                            been out of repair, and, therefore, not of themselves sufficient, as I
                            understood, to confine her if she determined to leave, they had ordered
                            a French ship-of-war around to Calais to lie off the dock to watch and
                            prevent her departure if necessary. I assured him I was happy to hear
                            this statement, and hoped that the French government would yet see its
                            way clear to making an order for the permanent detention of this
                            vessel.</p>
                        <p>Matters affecting our interests are apparently very quiet here at
                            present; but if you have another disastrous spring and summer campaign,
                            or even one of no useful and practical results, coming at the same time
                            or in connexion with the immediate proceedings of the French with the
                            archduke in Mexico, there will be a strong effort made here from
                            different quarters for recognition of the south. I am heart-sick of this
                            question, and was in hopes something definitive might be done in this
                            campaign; but if the late reports are true harbingers of the future, it
                            would seem that we are to have a repetition of the past—advancing and
                            retreating, battles gained and battles lost, but ending in nothing
                            decisive. The disaster in Florida, the return of the armies of the
                            southwest to Vicksburg and Memphis, and the small progress of Farragut
                            at Mobile have a very gloomy look for the future.</p>

                                seems, could not have escaped their attention. Although I have, on
                                this account, no good reason to doubt the correctness of the

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The new government in Mexico.</hi>—We have
                                reason to believe that, on accepting the crown of Mexico, the
                                emperor Maximilian will address from Miramas a formal notification
                                of his accession to the throne, to all the princes and powers with
                                which he desires to establish diplomatic relations. Among the number
                                are the United States of America, Mr. Dayton, the American minister
                                in Paris, having already intimated the readiness of his government
                                to accredit a representative in Mexico, and receive a minister from
                                the emperor of Mexico. Towards <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0075"
                                />the Confederate States the policy of Maximilian will be that of
                                strict neutrality. By the advice of the Emperor Napoleon he will
                                abstain from recognizing the independence of the southern
                                confederacy, or entering into any diplomatic relations with it until
                                France shall have done so. During Maximilian’s visit to Paris, Mr.
                                Slidell applied by letter to him for an audience. After consulting
                                his imperial host, Maximilian firmly but courteously declined to
                                grant it. The rumors, therefore, of an early recognition of the
                                Confederate States by France and Mexico, and an alliance between the
                                latter empire and the southern confederacy, are altogether devoid of
                                foundation.</p>

                            now in these cases, as it insisted in the beginning of our domestic
                            strife, that the decisions of the Emperor’s government, like those of
                            other maritime powers, by which the insurgents of this country, without
                            a port or a ship, or a court of admiralty, are recognized by France as a
                            naval belligerent, are in derogation of the law of nations and injurious
                            to the dignity and sovereignty of the United States; that they have
                            never approved or acquiesced in those decrees; and that they regard the
                            late proceedings in relation to the Florida and Georgia, like those of a
                            similar character which have occurred in previous cases, as just
                            subjects of complaint. The same, views are entertained so far as they
                            apply to the new maritime regulations. We claim that we are entitled to
                            have our national vessels received in French ports with the same
                            courtesy that we ourselves extend to French ships-of-war, and that all
                            real or pretended insurgent vessels ought to be altogether excluded from
                            French ports. We expect the time to come, and we believe it is not
                            distant, when this claim will be acknowledged by France to be both
                            reasonable and just.</p>

                            the report of the insurgent secretary of the navy, a copy of which
                            accompanied the instructions to you, No. <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56"
                                facs="0076"/>453, of the 4th of January last, has been questioned,
                            diligent inquiries have been made upon the subject. I am sorry to say
                            that they have resulted in ascertaining that the supposed report was
                            written by* * * * * * * * * This was just at the time when journals of a
                            late date from Richmond had reached the north and the genuineness of the
                            report was implicitly believed; my own convictions were of that
                            character, and were so strengthened by the fact that public documents
                            from the same quarter had always reached us in the same way. It seemed
                            that the author of the surreptitious report was chiefly actuated by a
                            desire to create the impression that he had means of communicating with
                            the insurgent capital superior to those of his professional brethren,
                            and superior enterprise in availing himself of them. Should a statement
                            of the truth upon this point be found necessary, you can make one, with
                            such reserve as may be deemed advisable.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatches from No. 497 to No. 502,
                            both inclusive, are duly received. I had already informed Mr. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys that my action as to the Rappahannock, as well as to the Florida
                            and Georgia, had been duly approved by my government. My notice to the
                            French government, that they would be held responsible for all damages
                            done by the Rappahannock, in case she should be permitted to go to sea,
                            was in anticipation of that event, and in the hope that the question,
                            being thus plainly presented in advance, they might prevent the wrong by
                            forbidding her departure. It has, perhaps, some effect, for she is yet
                            shut up in her basin, with strict orders not to permit her to depart
                            without first obtaining the direct authority of this government. The
                            officers of the ship, Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys informs me, “grumble” very
                            much at their enforced detention, but he has informed them that France
                            will not permit her ports to be used for the equipment of vessels-of-war
                            for the confederates. I have just received notice from our consular
                            agent at Calais, that Captain Campbell, as well as the first lieutenant
                            of the Rappahannock, have left her and gone back to England, with a
                            view, as they said, to buy and equip another ship there; and that a man
                            named Fonteroy (his baggage is marked “Colonel Fonteroy”) has taken
                            command of the Rappahannock. Our consular agent thinks this is
                            preparatory to the vessel’s leaving; but it is quite certain that she
                            has had no permit to leave, and had, a day or two since, on board
                            neither arms nor crew for any hostile purpose, or indeed to do anything
                            more than navigate her from one port to a neighboring port.</p>
                        <p>The Florida, I am advised, was recently at Teneriffe, for coal, and the
                            St. Louis watching her; but the former stole out of port by night and
                            escaped. I have this vessel and the Georgia so often reported to me by
                            our consuls and consular agents at impossible or improbable places, that
                            I have not thought it worth while to trouble you or the Navy Department
                            with their speculations and rumors on these subjects. I have, I believe,
                            in no case failed to make known to the French government the view which
                            our government has taken of its action in the case of the aid given to
                            these confederate vessels; but I do not think it wise to multiply <hi
                                rend="italic">sharp points,</hi> nor dignified to do more than make
                            this government understand distinctly our views, and the action which we
                            contemplate in future on these subjects. I have thus managed without
                            compromiting our government, or its interests, present or future, to
                            keep my personal relations with French officials on the best footing.
                            The importance of this, under all the circumstances, you will well
                            understand.</p>
                        <p>I should add here, perhaps, as corroborative of my last despatches, that
                            the Emperor (since the departure of the Archduke Maximilian) has said

                            acknowledgment, as is so generally reported in the English

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your confidential despatch of March 18th
                            has been received. We are still expecting that the ships-of-war on which
                            the insurgents are relying will not be suffered to depart from European
                            ports.</p>
                        <p>In the confusion incident to national legislation and to the speedy
                            organization of vast forces, it has happened that superior advantages
                            have been unconsciously afforded to military enlistments over
                            enlistments for the naval service. In consequence of this error the navy
                            is now suffering for the want of twelve thousand seamen, while the
                            armies of the United States are filled to the entire satisfaction of the
                            government. Measures have, however, been taken to correct this
                            inequality promptly, and I do not apprehend any inability to maintain
                            our blockade and to restore the national prestige on the ocean.</p>
                        <p>You intimate a dissatisfaction with the military operations of the
                            season, and you seem to apprehend a recognition of the insurgents by
                            maritime powers if we shall not be more successful. I do not think that
                            this country can again be alarmed by the fear of foreign recognition of
                            the insurgents. We believe that the war has passed the crisis when
                            recognition could guarantee success to the enemy. Recognition could,
                            therefore, in our view, only enlarge the field of war. At the same time,
                            I am sure that I need not say that we are no less earnestly <pb n="59"
                                xml:id="pg_59" facs="0079"/>desirous than we have been, at all times
                            heretofore, to guard against any new complication in our foreign
                            affairs. I think that the discontent with our military operations, which
                            you are experiencing, is the consequence of expectations unreasonably
                            excited by the press of the United States. The defeat of General Seymour
                            at Olustee, in Florida, was a surprise and was a disaster, but it was no
                            more than that; it drew neither serious consequences nor strategic
                            embarrassments after it. All our armies have been renewing themselves by
                            the reenlistment of veterans, whose terms of service were to expire in
                            the spring, summer, and autumn. With a view to this end, many regiments
                            have received furloughs of thirty days upon their re-enlistment, and
                            thus the armies in the field have been temporarily much reduced during
                            the inclement season, so that necessarily only two great military
                            movements have hitherto been attempted or even meditated. The first of
                            these was a movement of Sherman through central Mississippi, from
                            Vicksburg to Meridian, with a view to break up the communications of the
                            enemy, and relieve this government from the necessity of maintaining a
                            large force on the banks of the Mississippi river during the coming
                            campaign. Grierson’s and Smith’s movements were merely diversions
                            auxiliary to, but not indispensable to the success of this purpose; and
                            Admiral Farragut’s demonstration against Mobile was a movement of the
                            same character. Sherman accomplished all that he proposed, and so the
                            one end of all these movements was attained. The Adjutant General is now
                            placing colored troops in the garrisons on the river, while the veteran
                            forces are proceeding to active duty elsewhere. The other movement
                            which, as I have said, was contemplated in the inclement season, was an
                            expedition up the Red river, to scatter the insurgents and destroy
                            stores and communications on the west side of the Mississippi, so far as
                            the border of Texas. The movement is now in progress, and thus far has
                            been attended with success. We last heard of the combined land and naval
                            force at Natchitoches, in Louisiana. It is not surprising that the enemy
                            took alarm at these movements, and attributed to our generals designs
                            more stupendous and much more hazardous than those really entertained.
                            Our own press, of course unenlightened, gave license to its imagination,
                            and promised achievements which were not even meditated by our
                            commanders.</p>
                        <p>It is not unlikely that similar expectations may be based upon the
                            reports of the press concerning the campaign which General Grant, who
                            now is in command of all the military forces of the country, is
                            organizing. It will be well, therefore, to be on your guard in this
                            respect. What you may be assured of is, that our forces in the field and
                            fit for duty are, independently of the new conscription, eight hundred
                            thousand men; that they are distributed with a view to hold all the
                            country we have reclaimed, and to bring the insurgents into battle
                            whenever the circumstances are favorable. We do not expect cheap or easy
                            victories, but we look for firm and steady progress. In this view the
                            operations of the present year, although they have disappointed the
                            public, have not been unsatisfactory to the government. It is the
                            insurgents and not we who are the weaker for what has thus been
                            done.</p>
                        <p>I ought not to overlook the important fact disclosed by the elections in
                            Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana, namely, that the population of
                            several of the insurgent States, where it has not already been reclaimed
                            to the Union, has been successfully divided, whereby the insurrectionary
                            armies are continually reduced, and our own considerably augmented. If
                            you study the publications of the day you will learn that free labor is
                            already asserting its ability to produce cotton on the banks of the
                            Mississippi, and upon the sea islands. There is a development of another
                            kind too important to be overlooked. A great number of the people of the
                            insurgent States, wearied of the war, and despairing of the restoration
                            of order and peace there, are emigrating to the western territories.
                            Governor Doty, of Utah, a very intelligent pioneer, estimates the
                            augmentation of the population of the Territories, during the present
                            year, at <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0080"/>500,000—equal to one
                            seventieth part of the population of France. It can hardly be necessary
                            for me to point out to your sagacious observation the value of these
                            facts, as showing that every wound which is inflicted on the Union in
                            one part results in our increase of strength in every other part. We
                            need not fear that a political system which is so vigorous will
                            perish.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The difficulty between the general
                                government and Governor Vidaurri is daily becoming more complicated.
                                A decree from President Juarez, separating the states of Nuevo Leon
                                and Coahuila, was given at Saltillo on the 26th ultimo. The
                                following is a translation of the first article: “The state of
                                Coahuila will immediately re-assume its character as one of the free
                                and sovereign states of the united Mexican States, separating itself
                                from Nuevo Leon in which it was incorporated.” The separation of the
                                two. states gives President Juarez control of the Custen Hense or
                                Piedras Negras. Governor Vidaurri refuses to recognize the authority
                                of the president, and has declared his intention of driving him from
                                Nuevo Leon and Coahuila, and for that purpose is raising all the
                                forces he is able to arm.</p>
                            <p>Another decree from the president deposes Governor Vidaurri, and
                                declares this state in open hostility to the government of Mexico.
                                Communication between this place and Saltillo is almost entirely cut
                                off; no provisions of any kind are allowed to come this way. No
                                mails pass either way, and it is only by foreigners coming in that
                                we are able to learn of the movements of the government troops.</p>
                            <p>The president has now, in addition, to the troops he left here, a
                                force of about two thousand men from Durango, commanded by Governor
                                Petona in person, which, with the volunteers from Saltillo and other
                                points in the state of Coahuila, swells his numbers to not less than
                                five thousand men.</p>
                            <p>Governor Vidaurri has about twelve hundred men, but, with the
                                artillery he has belonging to the government, he will be able to
                                protect himself in the citadel against a large force.</p>
                            <p>An order was issued here on the 1st instant to the troops to prepare
                                    <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0081"/>themselves to march in
                                two days for Saltillo. The time was, to-day, further postponed until
                                the 7th instant.</p>
                            <p>A man just in from Saltillo represents the troops of President Juarez
                                preparing to march on this place. An advance of five hundred men
                                were twenty miles this side of Saltillo.</p>
                            <p>A despatch from General Bazaine, of the French forces, to Governor
                                Vidaurri was received a few days since. The following is its
                                substance:</p>
                            <p>“In one hand peace is offered; in the other, war. If you. accept the
                                former, you must adhere to the intervention frankly recognizing the
                                government which is established in Mexico. If, on the contrary, you
                                decide for the latter, you must expect to suffer all the calamities
                                incident to war.”</p>
                            <p>The governor made, in substance, the following answer:</p>
                            <p>“I have not the power to choose between the two extremes which you
                                propose, but will submit this vital question to the people, as I
                                have always done on grave subjects, and their determination transmit
                                to you as soon as obtained.”</p>
                            <p>No advance of the French army has been made since my last
                                communication; but, on the contrary, the report of their retreat to
                                San Luis Potosi is quite generally believed.</p>
                            <p>The reoccupation of the Guadaljara by General Urega, and the taking
                                by him of four thousand French and Reactienania prisoners, has given
                                new heart to the Mexicans of the liberal party.</p>
                            <p>The French army in San Luis Potosi is levying contributions on the
                                citizens for its support, and, instead of bringing peace, as they
                                offer in every instance in advance, they bring misery on the people
                                wherever their army goes.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I herewith send you a slip cut from the
                            Moniteur of the 1st instant. It is merely a reprint in a conspicuous
                            position, without comment, of an editorial taken from the Courrier des
                            Etats Unis. It has, however, attracted considerable attention here,
                            because indicating, as is supposed, what yet continues to be the policy
                            of the government as respects the acknowledgment of the south. The
                            Moniteur is so exclusively an official paper that a reprint, without
                            dissetn, of anything which purports to give the policy of this
                            government is looked upon by the public as equivalent to an indorsement
                            of the truth of the statement. It is quite certain, at all events, that
                            such republication in its pages is the manifestation of a purpose to
                            induce the public to believe that such is its policy. If this be so,
                            taking this reprinted editorial for our guide, France has yet no policy
                            as respects the south; she yet “waits on events.”</p>
                        <p>The editor of the Courrier des Etats Unis assumes that nothing has
                            occurred to change the relative position of parties since this
                            announcement to me by Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys, communicated in my despatch
                            of 30th of July, 1863. Assuming that the reprint of this editorial in
                            the Moniteur is even a quasi adoption of the views there expressed, you
                            will find that the whole is richly worth a perusal.</p>

                            <p>We read in the Courrier des Etats Unis:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">France and the United States</hi>: To sum up,
                                some two months ago the diplomatic correspondence exchanged during
                                the year 1863 between Paris and Washington, by reproducing the
                                clearness, of a policy of entire reserve and forbearance on the part
                                of France on the American question, which is found written in every
                                line therein, we added that people should not, on this account,
                                flatter themselves to have seen the end of the alarms of
                                intervention, nor the rumors of a near approaching recognition of
                                the south by Napoleon.</p>
                            <p>This foresight did not call for a great effort of the prophetic mind,
                                and the realization thereof had not made itself to be awaited for.
                                Once already, during the last month, we have had to notice pretended
                                news of negotiations entered upon between Richmond and Paris, to
                                bring about the simultaneous recognition of the confederate
                                government on the one part, and of the Mexican empire on the other.
                                More recently the department of State was obliged to give an
                                official denial to certain assertions, which had reference to
                                serious disagreements between France and the United States
                                respecting the vessels being built for account of the south in one
                                or two French ports. For some days past the newsmongers have again
                                got to work and state with more certainty than ever that the cabinet
                                of the Tuileries is upon the eve of recognizing Mr. Jefferson
                                Davis.</p>
                            <p>During the past three years we have for more than twenty times been
                                obliged to oppose this same bugbear, and as often has the event
                                demonstrated its entire inanity. With a journalism less exclusively
                                preoccupied with showing up without scruple and without examination
                                the feeling of the day; with a public more accustomed to discuss
                                matters of itself, and not to follow almost mechanically the bent
                                which the press chooses to give it, this theme would at this day be
                                worn out to the end of the tether, and should only raise a smile.
                                Doubtless such is the case among a certain class of enlightened and
                                observing minds, but the mass of the people continues to take for
                                ready money all that is served up to it. We must, therefore, at the
                                risk of tedious repetitions, oppose a new denial to each new
                                assertion which is produced, since people lose sight incessantly of
                                the teachings of the past.</p>
                            <p>We now, then, again repeat the assertion already so often given in
                                this same place, upon the attitude and intentions of France
                                respecting the American question.</p>
                            <p>This attitude and these intentions remain such as they have been
                                since the first day of the war; such as they have constantly
                                revealed themselves in the diplomatic correspondence of the last
                                three years.</p>
                            <p>In order to leave the present view (thought) of the imperial
                                government, one need only read over again the despatch of the 30th
                                of July, 1863, in which Mr. Dayton relates an interview which he had
                                just had with Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys, in relation to rumors similar to
                                those which we relate to-day.</p>
                            <p>The American diplomat then wrote:</p>
                            <p>“I have called his attention to the fact that the papers of our
                                country were commenting very much at this time upon the attitude
                                taken by the Emperor, and his intentions respecting the recognition
                                of the independence of the south.</p>
                            <p>“I asked him besides, categorically, what was the policy of the
                                Emperor towards the south. You will observe that in this manner I
                                approached my subject, without saying that formal instructions from
                                my government enjoined upon me to interrogate France upon these
                                questions.</p>
                            <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0083"/>
                            <p>“In reply to my question upon the policy of the Emperor towards the
                                south, he said to me that he had none; that he awaited events. You
                                will remember, doubtless, that I have told you heretofore that in my
                                opinion such was the case.”</p>
                            <p>This very clear declaration of the minister of foreign affairs of
                                France, corroborated by the personal conviction expressed by Mr.
                                Dayton, leaves not room for the shadow of a doubt as to what were,
                                some eight months ago, the views and the line of conduct of the
                                cabinet of the Tuileries. It goes at the same time beyond the period
                                at which it was. In saying that the imperial government limited
                                itself to await events, Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys indicated formally that
                                a a new situation could alone bring about any change in this
                                expectant attitude. But nothing of the kind has occurred since then.
                                The relative position of the belligerent parties is to-day exactly
                                what it was at the end of the month of July last France has,
                                therefore, had no reason to modify her policy of expectancy. To
                                suppose that she has done so, is to impute to her a gratuitous
                                inconsistency, contrary to all her usages, still more contrary to
                                the line of conduct from which she has not swerved a single moment
                                in the American question.</p>
                            <p>The impartial historian, who will be called upon at a later day to
                                judge of the international view of that civil war, will have, in
                                fact, to acknowledge that, in the midst of the imaginary shifts
                                which newsmongers and the public anxiety have imputed to it, the
                                imperial government has never deviated from the part (<hi
                                    rend="italic">rôle</hi>) which it laid out for itself at the
                                commencement of the contest. If it had had only the tenth part of
                                the after-thoughts of intervention which have been ascribed to it,
                                assuredly neither interest nor opportunity has been wanting to it.
                                Our suffering commerce; the prospect of the advantages of every sort
                                with which the south is ready to repay its official recognition; the
                                complication and the turn, both unexpected, of the Mexican question;
                                the declared and unjustifiable ill will of the press of the north;
                                the limits assigned by Mr. Seward to the termination of the contest
                                and ten times overrun; the regular working and the undeniable
                                vitality of the confederate government—here are more motives and
                                more pretexts than the United States themselves have often asked in
                                order to give their moral support to revolutionary movements. The
                                fact that France has not been willing to avail herself of them,
                                though the favorable moments have not been wanting to her, should at
                                least shield her from idle imputation to which her whole conduct
                                gives the lie, and which become offensive by dint of reproduction
                                without cause of existence.</p>
                            <p>The only two acts through which the cabinet of the Tuileries has
                                momentarily deviated from its part of a simple spectator, are the
                                proposition made in November, 1862, to England and Russia to offer
                                the good offices of a joint mediation to the federal government;
                                then the despatch of the 9th January, 1863, in which it suggested
                                the possibility of conferences between the two belligerent parties,
                                without on that account suspending the progress of hostilities.
                                Writers who are interested in perverting the facts, or who are led
                                astray by a false national pride, have affected to see in his double
                                proceeding an offensive intermeddling. The good sense of the public
                                has already in part done justice to this singular appreciation; as
                                time lapses it will acknowledge the more and more all the true good
                                will and sympathy which this attempt contained for the Union, made,
                                besides, with so much delicacy and reserve. Perhaps even the future
                                will reveal that, if it had obtained the concurrence of the cabinets
                                of St. Petersburgh and London, the idea of France might not have
                                been either so fruitless or so badly received at Washington, as it
                                was by remaining in the state of an isolated initiative. That which
                                is now undeniable, under all circumstances, is, that while seeking
                                to make the belligerent parties enter into the path of negotiation,
                                the imperial government has tried the only effort which has been
                                made during three years to conciliate the north and south, with the
                                end of reconstructing the former state of things. Whilst all the
                                other powers witnessed, unmoved and indifferent, if not secretly
                                content, the contest in which the <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64"
                                    facs="0084"/>greatness of America is gradually sinking itself,
                                France alone has attempted to open the door to a reconciliation.
                                Taking this for granted, in order to impute to her incessantly
                                malevolent intentions, is a singular reasoning, while at the same
                                time it is an act of blind ingratitude. If the ear has been closed
                                to her friendly voice, let her not at least be reproached because,
                                at an hour which she had powerful reasons for believing propitious,
                                she had desired to point out the path to safety.</p>
                            <p>France “awaits events;” this is the part which has been assigned her.
                                She does not think of changing, and the newsmongers who seek to
                                circulate the contrary would do well to ponder over this phrase,
                                which we borrow again from a despatch from Mr. Dayton.</p>
                            <p>“If the press of the United States could be made to understand the
                                evil which it does us abroad by exaggerating and commenting upon
                                these kind of rumors I am persuaded that it would exercise more
                                reserve.”</p>

                        <p>I am specially annoyed by the facts stated in despatch No. 509. If there
                            be any mode of punishing the author of the unprincipled and dishonest
                            fabrication of the report attributed to Mr. Mallory, I hope it will be

                        <p>I observe that Earl Russell, yesterday, in his place in Parliament,

                        <p>I have seen Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys to-day for the first time since the

                            a fraud had been practiced upon the public and on our government in
                            reference to this paper. He had evidently not attached much importance
                            to the subject, as I had some difficulty in recalling to his mind what
                            paper I was alluding to. I was the more surprised at this, as I left the
                            papers with him, as before said, at his own request, he meaning, as I
                            inferred, to give a written answer.</p>
                        <p>The confederates will take special pains to create the impression that a
                            fraud has been practiced by our government, and not a fraud upon it. The
                            spirit manifested will be seen in the annexed slip from their English
                            organ, the “Index,” cut from Galignani, of this morning, in which, by
                            the way, all that is evil and against us is always promptly copied.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Meddle and Muddle.</hi>—Some curious revelations
                                have come to our knowledge about the remonstrance which her
                                Majesty’s government has announced its intention to address to that
                                of the Confederate States, upon the basis of an alleged report of
                                the confederate secretary of the navy, which is denounced by the
                                confederates in Europe as a forgery. It will be remembered that the
                                recall of three of the four British consols within the confederate
                                jurisdiction, and the dismissal by the confederate government of the
                                fourth and last remaining, left the foreign office no alternative
                                but to communicate with the authorities at Richmond by a special
                                envoy. For this delicate mission Mr. Crawford, her Majesty’s
                                consul-general at Havana, was selected, and it must be admitted that
                                in this selection Earl Russell displayed far more tact and
                                discretion than he has of late been able to claim credit for. Mr.
                                Crawford, both before and since the war, has been well and favoraby
                                known in the southern States, and is universally esteemed there. Few
                                persons, therefore, could have been found better adapted to
                                discharge so disagreeable a duty without giving offence. Before,
                                however, proceeding in person to Richmond, he was instructed to
                                acquaint the confederate government with the nature of his
                                communication, and ascertain whether it would be received. For this
                                purpose the steamer Petrel was sent to a confederate port, but was
                                peremptorily refused admission by the federal blockading squadron,
                                on the ground that no direct communication with the confederate
                                authorities by a foreign government could be permitted. Here the
                                matter stands at present, and it leaves Earl Russell in no very
                                agreeable or dignified dilemma.</p>
                            <p>It is generally believed in confederate circles that the object of
                                the Washington government is to delay as long as possible the
                                official exposure of the forgery, which must inevitably ensue on the
                                presentation of a remonstrance based upon a document to which the
                                name of the confederate secretary of the navy is fraudulently
                                appended.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys has informed me
                            to-day that Annan had sold to Sweden those two iron-clad rams now being
                            built by him at Bordeaux for the confederates. He assured Mr. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys that the affair was completed, and offered to show him the
                            contract which he then had in his hands. Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys says he
                            did not examine the contract, but says he is satisfied that the sale has
                            been made. I told him frankly I had little confidence in Arman’s
                            statements on this subject, and should immediately write to our minister
                            at Sweden to make sure of the facts. I shall do so by this mail.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Arman said likewise that he was seeking a neutral purchaser for those
                            clipper ships, although, as he said, these were mere vessels of
                            commerce. Two of them are advertised in the Bordeaux papers to sail in
                            the China line—one called the Yeddo, on the 30th of this month; the
                            other, called the Ozaca, on the 30th of next month.</p>
                        <p>The Rappahannock, yet in the basin at Calais, he says, is a great trouble
                            to him. He seems scarcely to know what ultimately to do with her.</p>
                        <p>It seems he has a committee of jurisconsults connected with his
                            department as advisers, and says he means to submit the facts to
                            them.</p>
                        <p>I have, of course, made him aware from the beginning that the treatment
                            given to these insurgent vessels was looked upon by us as a violation of
                            international law, and as involving a just ground of complaint by us
                            against the French government.</p>
                        <p>I have told him, too, that our government held all restrictions imposed
                            by port rules on our vessels-of-war differing from those imposed by us
                            upon their vessels, as illegal and unjust. That we claimed in their
                            ports every courtesy that we extended to them in the ports of our own
                            country.</p>
                        <p>I do not think there can possibly be any misunderstanding as to our
                            meaning on these questions.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of March 25, No. 440, has
                            been received.</p>
                        <p>You allude therein to a report that reaches us through English journals
                            of effect that it is arranged that the projected imperial government in
                            Mexico shall soon extend a recognition to the insurgents at Richmond.
                            The contradiction of this report, on the authority of the Emperor of
                            France, as you have communicated it to me, is gratifying, although no
                            credit whatever has been given here to the statements referred to. On
                            the contrary, it has not seemed probable that the Prince Maximilian
                            could extend his guardianship to insurgents here while yet engaged in a
                            struggle with the existing authorities of Mexico, unless indeed he was
                            assured of support in that event by the government of France. Nor has it
                            seemed probable, in view of previous explanations of M. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys, that the Emperor of the French would be anxious to enlarge his
                            responsibilities concerning American politics, at least before the
                            Mexican problem should have definitely reached a solution.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Geofroy, charge d’affaires of the
                            Emperor, has submitted for my perusal a despatch which, on the 21st of
                            March last, was addressed to him by M. Drouyn de l’Huys, in which he
                            renews a request that the French government may be allowed to send to
                            this country some officers who shall have facilities for observing
                            military arrangements and preparations on both sides of the civil war,
                            with an exclusive view to their bearing on improvements in the art of
                            war. M. Drouyn de l’Huys, in support of this request, reminds us that
                            all governments which follow with most marked interest the progress of
                            military art have, every time when war has broken out, obtained the
                            privilege of attaching officers for making such observations to general
                            staff of each of the belligerents.</p>
                        <p>We have cheerfully acceded to this urgent application, so far as it
                            relates to the army of the United States, but we cannot extend the
                            commission so as to permit commissioners to pass our lines to make
                            observations among the insurgents. You need not be informed that the
                            United States have not only not recognized the insurgents of this
                            country as a lawful belligerent, but that this government constantly
                            protested against the award of that character to them by France, and
                            other foreign powers. We have distinctly asserted that they ought to be
                            regarded by all friendly powers as avowed insurgents.</p>
                        <p>The President has not deviated from this line of policy, and could not
                            with a just regard to the public welfare deviate from it further than to
                            alleviate the severities of the painful conflict by such exceptional
                            practices in regard to prisoners of war as the sympathies of fraternity
                            and humanity require.</p>
                        <p>We have no jealousy of France, and have perfect confidence that such a
                            military commission as she proposes would conduct itself with entire
                            abstinence from whatever might be prejudicial to the United States. But
                            at the same time we cannot fail to see that the insurgents themselves
                            would infer from such a concession to France that we were willing to
                            regard them as a recognized military power, and that this erroneous
                            interpretation would have a tendency to prolong their resistance to the
                            national authority. Not long ago her Britannic Majesty’s government
                            applied to the United States for leave to send an agent through our
                            military lines to remonstrate with the insurgents. It was believed that
                            such a remonstrance could not in itself be injurious to the interests of
                            this government; but the request was nevertheless declined upon the same
                            general ground that I have assumed in this communication.</p>
                        <p>You will please make these necessary explanations to M. Drouyn de l’Huys,
                            with the assurance that the President sincerely regrets that he finds
                            himself obliged to withhold a courtesy which would be gratifying to the
                            Emperor of France. I have frankly made known to Mr. Geofroy the contents
                            of this despatch.</p>

                            seem, have rendered the action of the Archduke Maximilian somewhat
                            uncertain, and have much delayed <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0088"
                            />his departure, it would seem he has at last accepted the offered crown
                            of Mexico, and to-day he starts on his most adventurous career, going to
                            that country by the way of Rome that he may receive the benediction of
                            the Pope. I enclose you a slip, cut from Galignani, giving the substance
                            of his speech to the Mexican deputation upon accepting the crown offered
                            by them, and likewise another short slip, cut from the Moniteur, being
                            its only comment of to-day on the subject. The French papers say that
                            his government will not only be promptly acknowledged by the Catholic
                            powers, but by all the leading governments of Europe, including England,
                            Russia, Prussia, and France. For something like this you will, of
                            course, be prepared.</p>
                        <p>I need not say what I have in substance said before, that I look upon
                            this proceeding with intense anxiety. Nothing has occurred since my
                            residence at this court which foreshadows future difficulty with France
                            so probably as its action in this matter. God grant that it may be long
                            delayed, and, if possible, avoided; but I fear. * * * * * * *</p>

                                day, a little before noon, took place, at Miramar, the official
                                reception of the Mexican deputation, and the acceptation of the
                                crown of Mexico by the Archduke Maximilian. M. Guttierez de Estrada,
                                the head of the deputation, delivered a long address, in which he
                                dwelt on the importance of the national vote of Mexico. The
                                archduke, replying in Spanish, said that he felt not the slightest
                                doubt, from the act of adhesion just presented to him, that the
                                immense majority of the country were in favor of the imperial form
                                of government, and of himself as the head of the state. The choice
                                of the country had been laid down in his reply of October 3 as one
                                condition of his acceptance; and another was that full guarantees
                                should be given of his being able to devote himself peaceably to the
                                task of advancing the prosperity of the country. Those guarantees
                                were now fully assured, thanks to the magnanimity of the Emperor of
                                the French, who, during the whole of the negotiations, had shown a
                                straightforwardness and kindness which he (the speaker) could never
                                forget. ‘The illustrious head of my family,’ pursued the archduke,
                                ‘having given his consent, I now declare that, relying on the
                                assistance of the Almighty, I accept the crown offered me by the
                                Mexican nation. As I stated in my address of October 3, I shall
                                endeavor to place the monarchy under the authority of the
                                constitutional laws as soon as the pacification of the country shall
                                be complete. The force of a government is, in my opinion, more
                                assured by sound regulations than by the extent of its limits, and I
                                shall be anxious for the exercise of my government to fix such
                                bounds to it as may insure its duration. I shall hold firmly aloft
                                the flag of independence, as the symbol of our future grandeur. I
                                call for the cooperation of all the Mexicans who love their country
                                to aid me in the accomplishment of my noble but most difficult task.
                                Never shall my government forget the gratitude it owes to the
                                illustrious sovereign whose friendly support has rendered the
                                regeneration of our noble land possible. I am now on the point of
                                leaving for my new country, paying, as I go, a visit to Rome, where
                                I shall receive from the holy father that benediction which is so
                                precious for all sovereigns, but above all to me, called, as I am,
                                to found a new empire.”</p>

                            <p>To-day, the 10th of April, at ten o’clock in the morning, the
                                Archduke Maximilian received at his palace of Miramar the Mexican
                                deputation charged with the duty of offering to him the crown. Mr.
                                Gutierez de Estrada, the head of the deputation, made a speech to
                                his imperial and royal highness on presenting to him the vote of the
                                people of the various localities.</p>
                            <p>The archduke replied by a formal acceptance.</p>
                            <p>The head of the deputation thanked his Majesty, and laid at his feet

                            <p>Immediately the Mexican flag was hoisted on the palace, and was
                                saluted with twenty-one guns. A <hi rend="italic">Te Deum</hi> was
                                sung.</p>
                            <p>To-morrow, at four o’clock, the Emperor and Empress of Mexico will

                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Memorial Diplomatique</hi> gives a long account
                                of the reception of the Mexican deputation at Miramar on Sunday. As
                                the archduke always throws open his park to the public on holidays,
                                an immense crowd collected to witness the arrival of the procession.
                                The account says:</p>
                            <p>“Four carriages, belonging to his imperial highness, preceded by
                                outriders, went to convey the deputation from the hotel where they
                                had lodged at the expense of the archduke. The deputation was
                                composed of M. Gutierrez de Estrada, the president; Colonel
                                Velasquez de Leon, ex-minister; M. Aguilar, ex-chargé d’affaires;
                                General Woll; M. Esandon, banker; and M. Landa, merchant. A number
                                of eminent Mexicans, among whom were M. Arrangoiz, ex-minister of
                                finance; M. Murphy, formerly Mexican envoy at London. Colonel Fatio,
                                M. Gutierrez de Estrada, jun., with several generals, colonels, and
                                other officers, accompanied the deputation. All were in full
                                uniform, as were also the officers of the household of the archduke,
                                aides-de-camp, and the chamberlains. The deputation, after being
                                received by Count Zichy, who filled the functions of grand master of
                                the household of his imperial highness, were introduced into the
                                grand drawing-room, into which the Archduke Maximilian, wearing the
                                uniform of an Austrian vice-admiral, immediately afterwards entered.
                                The French and Belgian ministers in Austria were present at the
                                solemnity. M Gutierrez de Estrada then delivered a speech in the
                                Spanish language expressing the joy felt by the Mexican deputation
                                in finding themselves in presence of his imperial highness; they had
                                come in the name of the imperial regency to announce that the vote
                                of the notables which had conferred the crown on him is <pb n="70"
                                    xml:id="pg_70" facs="0090"/>henceforth ratified by the
                                enthusiastic adhesion of the immense majority of the country; the
                                unanimous acclamation of the notables of Mexico, of the municipal
                                authorities and of the popular corporations has become a truly
                                national vote.”</p>
                            <p>The archduke then made the reply which has been transmitted by
                                telegram. The account then goes on to say:</p>
                            <p>“As soon as the archduke had uttered the last word, the deputation
                                and all the Mexicans present acclaimed their new sovereign by crying
                                out three times ‘God save the Emperor Maximilian I.’ ‘God save the
                                Empress Charlotte!’ At the same instant, salutes of artillery, fired
                                from the bastions of the castle, announced to the public, the
                                accession of the Archduke Maximilian to the throne of Mexico, and
                                were immediately followed by other salutes from the port and town of
                                Trieste. Then M. Gutierrez de Estrada, as president of the
                                deputation, returned thanks to his Majesty for his definitive
                                acceptance of the Mexican crown. He said:</p>
                            <p>“Sire, this complete and absolute acceptation on the part of your
                                Majesty is the prelude of our happiness; it is the consecration of
                                the salvation of Mexico, of its approaching regeneration, of its
                                future greatness. Every year, on this day, our children will offer
                                up their thanksgivings to Heaven in gratitude for our miraculous
                                deliverance. As for us, sire, there remains a last duty to perform,
                                and that is to lay at your feet our love, our gratitude, and the
                                homage of our fidelity.”</p>
                            <p>On saying those words the president of the deputation bent his knee
                                and kissed the hand of the new sovereign, according to Spanish
                                custom, as a mark of homage. His example was followed by all the
                                Mexicans present. A proces verbal of the acceptance of the crown of
                                Mexico having been drawn up, the Emperor Maximilian first affixed
                                his signature to it, after which the members of the deputation did
                                the same, and lastly the notable Mexicans. That ceremony having been
                                accomplished, the deputation proceeded into the apartments of the
                                Princess Charlotte, whom they also proclaimed, and rendered homage
                                to her in the same manner. While those things were taking place at
                                Miramar, the news of the proclamation of the Emperor of Mexico had
                                already reached Trieste, and the bishop had a solemn <hi
                                    rend="italic">Te Deum</hi> of thanksgiving celebrated in the
                                cathedral of San Giusto, at which all the authorities of the town
                                were present. Salutes from the batteries were fired at the same
                                time. On the same day M. Velasquez de Leon, minister without
                                portfolio, and General Woll, chief of the military household, took
                                possession of their respective posts near the person of the Emperor.
                                In the evening there was to be a grand dinner at Miramar, when the
                                new Emperor was to appear for the first time in the uniform of a
                                Mexican lieutenant general, modified on the model of the French
                                army. His Majesty Maximilian I will also wear the insignia of the
                                order of the Virgin of La Guadalupa and of the national order of
                                Mexico. A grand representation and a full-dress ball are to be given
                                at the theatre at Trieste by the municipality.”</p>
                            <p>The same journal likewise gives some information as to the settlement
                                of the difference which has arisen concerning the Archduke
                                Maximilian’s position in the reigning family in Austria. It
                                says:</p>
                            <p>“To avoid dynastic quarrels and obviate the partition of the
                                patrimonial property of the house of Austria, a family law imposes
                                on every archduchess contracting marriage the obligation of signing
                                an act of renunciation. By this engagement she undertakes not to
                                raise for herself or for her descendants of either sex any
                                pretensions to the eventual succession to the throne, nor to any
                                participation in either the endowments raised on the patrimonial
                                property, or the inheritances which might fall in <hi rend="italic"
                                    >ab intestato.</hi> The creation of the patrimonial property
                                dates from the reign of Maria Theresa; a considerable portion of the
                                family property was set aside for the extraordinary requirements of
                                the different members of the family. The Grand Duke of Tuscany and
                                the Duke <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0091"/>of Modena, for
                                example, now receive from that source incomes which could not figure
                                on the budget of the state. Until now these acts of renunciation had
                                only occurred on the marriage of archduchesses. The acceptation of a
                                foreign crown by an archduke is a fact without precedent in the
                                annals of the house of Hapsburg. Was it advisable to subject the
                                archduke to the above-mentioned law? A family council, which
                                assembled during the last stay of the archduke in Vienna, took the
                                question into consideration. Different considerations caused the
                                majority of its members to decide in the affirmative. The Archduke
                                Maximilian is the first agnate. As such, if (which Heaven forbid)
                                the Emperor Francis Joseph should die without a male heir, he would
                                be called on by right to the succession to the throne. There was so
                                little time after the return of the archduke to Vienna from
                                Brussels, where he received the final vote of the Mexican nation,
                                that it was not possible to make all the family arrangements before
                                the time first fixed for receiving the deputation. He was therefore
                                called on to give his adhesion to a copy of the acts of renunciation
                                which the archduchesses usually signed previously to their marriage,
                                and which had always hitherto remained in the same form. In the
                                precipitation which circumstances rendered necessary, the great
                                difference between an archduke accepting a foreign crown and an
                                archduchess marrying a foreign prince had been over-looked. Every
                                princess by her marriage ceases to belong to the imperial family,
                                and loses her quality of agnate to such an extent that her heirs are
                                only entitled to the title of cognates. The Archduke Maximilian, on
                                the contrary, still retained his title of first agnate, after
                                accepting the sceptre of Montezuma. This consideration justifies the
                                objections which the archduke raised against the document submitted
                                for his signature. Negotiations were found necessary to bring
                                matters to an arrangement. As regards the former, the wording of the
                                act has been completely changed, in order not only to remove
                                whatever might wound the prince’s feelings, but also to mention the
                                spontaneousness of his resolution. As regards the substance, the
                                prince, having firmly resolved to devote himself to the destinies of
                                the people which has chosen him, renounces for himself and his
                                heirs, of both sexes, all right to the eventual succession to the
                                throne of Austria <hi rend="italic">so long as the new Mexican
                                    dynasty shall continue to reign.</hi> The renunciation is
                                therefore not absolute. In declaring that the effects of his
                                renunciation will continue so long as his dynasty shall reign, he
                                implicitly deprives himself of the right of abdicating, except under
                                the pressure of causes independent of his will. He also engages to
                                respect accomplished facts in the interior of the Austrian monarchy.
                                After leaving, if during his absence one of his brothers should be
                                called on to succeed to the throne, he would recognize him as
                                legitimate sovereign. We have no need to point out the extent of the
                                concession at the point of view of Mexican interests. But that is
                                not all: the archduke has made other sacrifices; he has abandoned
                                the half of his apanage, and the whole of his rights of succession
                                    <hi rend="italic">ab intestato.</hi> The future Empress, as
                                archduchess, received a sum of 20,000 florins (50,000 fr.) as pin
                                money; wishing to join in the disinterestedness of her august
                                husband, she has also renounced that income. Finally, the
                                difficulties of which we have just pointed out the origin and the
                                conclusion, will have, on the whole, only served to place more in
                                relief thenoble and generous character of the archduke.”</p>
                            <p>The late proceedings at Miramar and the acceptation of the Mexican
                                throne by the Archduke Maximilian are remarked on by several of the
                                Paris journals, which seem to draw a long breath of satisfaction at
                                finding this apparently interminable affair at last brought to a
                                close. The <hi rend="italic">Constitutionnel</hi> has the subjoined
                                observations:</p>
                            <p>“Every one is well aware to what a condition anarchy, under the form
                                of a republic, had reduced Mexico. Both France and Europe knew only
                                too well the deplorable state, as far as concerns both her material
                                and her moral interests, into which that unfortunate country had
                                fallen, inconsequence of the ephemeral <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72"
                                    facs="0092"/>and spoliating governments, scarcely recognized at
                                home and despised abroad. what is less known is that Mexico, already
                                despoiled of half her territory, was the sure and speedy conquest of
                                the United States. The word conquest, however, is too noble; for
                                Mexico was put up to the highest bidder. If the disgraceful contract
                                had been realized, the consequences of it would have been
                                incalculable, the Latin races would have received a check from which
                                they would with difficulty have recovered. The principles of
                                civilization, which constitute our moral influence in the world,
                                would have been deeply interfered with; that is the idea which the
                                Emperor Napoleon III expressd with extraordinary energy in his
                                letter to the commander-in-chief of the French expedition. Mexico,
                                by the re-establishment of the monarchy, returns into her
                                traditional path, and again finds the true conditions of order and
                                prosperity without sacrificing anything of her independence. What a
                                noble mission for the young prince who accepts it so boldly, and
                                comprehends it so well. France will thus have once more merited well
                                from civilization. Once more short-sighted politicians will have
                                been in the wrong, and, thanks to the great prudence which presides
                                over our destinies, and to that perseverance which triumphs over
                                obstacles and marches forward to its object with admirable calmness,
                                this regeneration of Mexico which is being prepared will be one of
                                the noblest pages of our civilizing mission in the world.”</p>
                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">France</hi> also has some remarks on the same
                                subject, the following being an extract:</p>
                            <p>“The acceptance of the throne of Mexico by the Archduke Maximilian is
                                for France a complete solution. Her task is finished. Her army will
                                now return home in succession, with the prestige of a fresh glory
                                and the consciousness of having performed one of the most
                                considerable works of the present age. The expenses which that great
                                expedition has entailed are about to be reimbursed with all the
                                legitimate indemnities that French subjects can claim. We have in
                                the face of history the honour of having constituted, alone, in
                                spite of the desertion of our allies, and notwithstanding the
                                difficulties and perils of the undertaking, in the rich regions of
                                Central America an empire, the stability of which is important for
                                the interests of the whole world. It is not only a triumph for the
                                French flag, but also for our principles. The Mexican empire is
                                established on the basis of popular suffrage, which is, in the new
                                right of which France is the expression, the only legitimate
                                foundation of governments. It is also a triumph for that great
                                policy which occupies itself before all with the general balance of
                                power of modern nations, and which, in establishing in Mexico a
                                strong, national, and regular government there, defends at once the
                                interests of Europe and those of all the nationalities of South
                                America. Lastly, French interests must there find guarantees and
                                particular advantages, which cannot fail to excite attention. There
                                has been created on the other side of the Atlantic, by the victories
                                of our soldiers, an empire which owes its existence to us; which the
                                bonds of the most cordial friendship and of the most legitimate
                                gratitude must unite to us; which will give fresh strength to the
                                straightforward influence of our policy in the New World, and open
                                the unexplored treasures of its vast territory to French commerce
                                and industry. The dignified and elevated speech delivered by the new
                                Emperor, on receiving the Mexican deputation, proves how highly he
                                appreciates and how much he desires to second the generous views of
                                France. He twice expressed, in the warmest terms, his deep gratitude
                                and his lively sympathy for the sovereign whose firm policy has
                                conquered for him a powerful throne. The work of France is
                                terminated. That of the Emperor Maximilian now begins.”</p>
                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> expresses itself in these
                                terms:</p>
                            <p>“There is above all a fact, which ought to be placed in the strongest
                                light. In accepting the throne of Mexico in virtue of popular right,
                                the Archduke Maximilian renders to that source of authority a
                                striking homage, which is the more precious that it emanates from a
                                Hapsburg, and a member of that dynasty <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73"
                                    facs="0093"/>which thus far has the most openly disdained and
                                outraged the principle of national sovereignty: We are about to
                                witness the strange spectacle of two brothers, one of whom in Europe
                                overrides that principle of nationality from which the other in
                                Mexico demands the consecration of his sovereign power. We shall, no
                                doubt, be permitted to invoke this precedent when we are contending
                                against the policy of Austria in Italy, Hungary, and elsewhere. The
                                example of Maximilian I promises, besides, other arguments to the
                                defenders of liberal causes. The prince proposes to inaugurate a
                                constitutional regime which will soon replace, in his hands, the
                                constitutent power which has provisionally devolved on him. The fact
                                must not be concealed that in a country disordered and ravaged by
                                civil war, the reign of liberty will be difficult to establish; in
                                such a regime is, however, the only hope of safety. A system of
                                government which has been preceded by a foreign rule should more
                                than any other invigorate and strengthen itself by the employment of
                                the national resources. An abuse of power could only give the prince
                                a temporary authority; by a liberal government only can be effected
                                a reconiliation and a pacification of all the opposing elements by
                                which Mexico is disturbed. Arbitrary power will, besides, not be
                                easily implanted in a country which has thrown off the yoke of its
                                dictatorships, and which has before it, around it, and everywhere,
                                the example of nations governing themselves and prospering by
                                liberty.”</p>
                            <p>“Letters from Vienna,” says the <hi rend="italic">Patrie,</hi> “state
                                that the parting of the Emperor from his brother the Archduke
                                Maximilian was rather cool. The idea of a Mexican Empire with an
                                Austrian Prince as sovereign met with decided resistance, up to the
                                very last moment, in the official circles of the Austrian capital.
                                The firmness of character of the archduke alone was able to triumph
                                over that opposition, and now that the uselessness of all those
                                efforts has been proved, the watchword in the regions of Vienna is:
                                ‘Mexico and its Emperor are strangers to Austria and her
                                interests.’”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I visited M. Drouyn de l’Huys yesterday,
                            at the department of foreign affairs. The first words he addressed to me
                            on entering the room were, “Do you bring us peace, or bring us war?” I
                            asked him to what he referred, and he said he referred more immediately
                            to those resolutions recently passed by Congress in reference to the
                            invasion of Mexico by the French, and the establishment of Maximilian
                            upon the throne of that country. I said to him, in reply, that I did not
                            think France had a right to infer that we were about to make war against
                            her on account of anything contained in those resolutions. That they
                            embodied nothing more than had been constantly held out to the French
                            government from the beginning. That I had always represented to the
                            government here that any action on their part, interfering with the form
                            of government in Mexico, would be looked upon with dissatisfaction in
                            our country, and they could not expect us to be in haste to acknowledge
                            a monarchical government built upon the foundations of a republic which
                            was our next neighbor. That I had reason to believe you had held the
                            same language to the French minister in the United States. This
                            allegation he did not seem to deny, but obviously viewed the resolutions
                            in question as a serious step upon our part; and I am told that the
                            leading secessionists here build largely upon these resolutions as a
                            means of fomenting ill feeling between this country and some others, and
                            ourselves. Mr. Mason and his secretary have gone to Brussels to confer
                            with Mr. Dudley Mann, who is their commissioner at that place. Mr.
                            Slidell, it is said, was to have gone to Austria, although he has not
                            yet got off.</p>

                        <p>Our consul at Bordeaux informs me that the Georgia is still lying there
                            three miles below that port, and that, as she came in to repair her
                            engine, by putting <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0097"/>force enough
                            at work to tinker about the repairs and not make them, she may remain
                            there as long as she may think proper. The rule is that they need not
                            leave port until the repairs are completed. Our consul says that it is
                            rumored and believed that arms and munitions of war are on the Georgia
                            for the purpose of being supplied to the Yeddo, one of the clippers,
                            when she goes out, and that a crew for the clipper is being kept at a
                            boarding-house at Bordeaux. To these reputed facts I have, of course,
                            called the attention of M. Drouyn de l’Huys.</p>
                        <p>Those clipper ships at Bordeaux and at Nantes have all closed up, or,
                            rather, concealed their port-holes, so as to a casual observer they
                            would have no appearance of ships-of-war.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The parties concerned continue to advertise in the Gironde at Bordeaux
                            that one will leave for China on the 30th of next month, and the other
                            on the 30th of the month after. The time for sailing, you will observe,
                            has been extended one month for each vessel.</p>
                        <p>I do not at all doubt the good faith of M. Drouyn de l’Huys in reference
                            to the sailing of these vessels.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: By a letter dated yesterday, you did
                                me the honor to inform me that Mr. Dayton, minister of the United
                                States at Paris, having learned that certain “clippers,” and two
                                “iron-clad vessels’ were In the course of construction at Bordeaux,
                                by Mr. Arman, and being apprehensive that they were destined to <pb
                                    n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0098"/>a use prejudicial to his
                                government, had made representations upon this subject to the French
                                government, from which Mr. Dayton had received the assurance that
                                the construction of the said vessels would not be authorized, or, at
                                least, that they should not be delivered to the Confederate States
                                or to their agents. You add that, in a letter of the 8th of this
                                month, Mr. Dayton has written to you that the constructor, Mr.
                                Arman, had the day before given M. Drouyn de l’Huys the assurance
                                that these vessels-of-war had been sold to Sweden; that the contract
                                had been finally concluded, and that he had offered to show it to M.
                                the minister of foreign affairs.</p>
                            <p>In answer to this communication on your part, it is my duty to state,
                                in the most explicit manner, that no vessel-of-war or iron-clad ship
                                has been ordered at Bordeaux by the government of Sweden and Norway,
                                or constructed in that city on its account, and that, therefore, no
                                contract can have been made with Mr. Arman or any other constructor
                                of vessels at Bordeaux. I believe I should add that offers to this
                                effect were made to the government of the King some months since on
                                the part of Mr. Arman, but that they were declined in a manner to
                                leave no doubt as to the intentions of the government of the King
                                not to profit by them.</p>
                            <p>There is, then, as far as we are concerned, in the declaration of Mr.
                                Arman a manifest error, which, in our desire to maintain the
                                excellent relations which have always existed between our
                                governments and that of the United States of America, it is
                                important for us not to allow to exist.</p>
                            <p>In authorizing you, sir, to make whatever use of this letter you
                                shall judge proper, I seize the occasion to renew to you the

                            governments for officers in their military service to visit the United
                            States armies for professional observations have hitherto been complied
                            with, and many such officers have repaired. to points where those armies
                            have been stationed. As yet no French officers have presented themselves
                            for that purpose, but as it is not unlikely that some may soon be
                            expected, it is proper I should inform, you that, in view of the
                            movements of our forces on an extended scale, which are about to
                            commence, while we adhere to the same rule of comity as a general one;
                            yet, that at the present moment, the Secretary of War deems it expedient
                            to make an exception of the army of the Potomac. Pursuant to this
                            decision, Mr. Stanton has already rejected numerous applications on
                            behalf of British officers, and will deem himself compelled, at present,
                            to pursue the same course in respect to any French officers in whose
                            behalf similar applications may be made. You will make known this
                            decision to Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys with a view to anticipate any
                            disappointment which it may occasion.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: By an arrival from Matamoras we have
                                added to the population of this colony a number of southerners, who
                                escaped from Texas, and have determined to take up their residence
                                within these possessions. They report that there is no hope left for
                                the confederacy, and that there are thousands now in Texas who are
                                anxious to escape, but cannot, in consequence of the stringency of
                                the blockade. That is to say, these are parties who either cannot
                                remain in the south after the rebellion shall be closed, in
                                consequence of their not being comprehended in the amnesty
                                proclamation, or from a deep-seated hatred and animosity will not
                                again consent to reside among us as brother members of the same
                                national family.</p>
                            <p>The individuals above referred to, as having just arrived here, are
                                the second arrival of the kind within the past few weeks, all
                                bringing the same report. Now, if these reports be true, (and I
                                doubt not they are true,) then it seems to me that an important
                                consideration is at once presented, namely, as to whether it would
                                not be humane as well as politic to allow <hi rend="italic"
                                    >some</hi> door to be opened by which such persons may escape
                                from our country. If their animosities are such that they are no
                                longer willing to live with us in peace, then I argue that they are
                                not worth having as citizens and residents. Their places can soon be
                                filled by a better class of persons. When I write thus, it must not
                                be presumed that I would have our government and nation ignore the
                                punishing, even to the execution of a death sentence, the
                                arch-traitors, and to accomplish that end to carefully close all the
                                avenues by which such might escape. I refer more particularly to
                                that class of persons who, from bitterness of feeling, are unwilling
                                to take an oath of allegiance, or to longer live in peace with us,
                                and hence prefer to seek a home in a foreign land; The fact is, that
                                the authorities and large landed proprietors of this colony imagine
                                that they can see in those persons the hope of this country, that,
                                if they can be allowed to escape from the south, thousands would
                                seek their homes in British Honduras, thus furnishing at once an
                                intelligent, experienced and producing population, particularly in
                                the cultivation of cotton, sugar, tobacco, &amp;c., and I have made
                                the suggestions herein contained at the direct request of some
                                wealthy and influential gentlemen of this place. On yesterday
                                Governor Austin gave his first dinner party, at which this subject
                                was canvassed, and I there promised to communicate with the United
                                States government in regard to the matter; hence, if you deem the
                                suggestions worthy of consideration, I beg to ask, on behalf of the
                                parties <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0100"/>above alluded to, at
                                the head of which may be considered the governor, that you will be
                                pleased to communicate it to the honorable Secretary of State,
                                through whom it may reach the President.</p>
                            <p>With great respect, I have the honor to be your most obedient

                            been received.</p>
                        <p>I thank you for the information it brings concerning the acceptance of
                            the tendered crown by the Archduke Maximilian, and his intended
                            departure for Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Events which have recently occurred in the eastern section of that
                            country, if they are correctly reported, show that the Mexican national
                            authorities are not likely to be immediately suppressed. It is of course
                            not impossible that new embarrassments for this government may grow out
                            of the archduke’s assumption of authority in Mexico. But we shall do all
                            that prudence, justice, and honor require to avert them, at the same
                            time we shall not forego the assertion of any of our national
                            rights.</p>
                        <p>If such precautions fail to secure us against aggression, we shall then,
                            I trust, be able to rise, without great effort, to the new duties which
                            in that case will have devolved upon us. I remain now firm, as
                            heretofore, in the opinion that the destinies of the American continent
                            are not to be permanently controlled by any political arrangements that
                            can be made in the capitals of Europe.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In a conference with M. Drouyn de l’Huys
                            on Saturday last he informed me that the officers or persons who had
                            heretofore been pressing the French government to permit the departure
                            of the Rappahannock from Calais had informed him that they would abandon
                            all further effort to that effect, and leave her to rot where she lies.
                            I am informed that she is now not seaworthy, and that her officers, with
                            the exception of Captain Fontleroy, have left her. Under these
                            circumstances I have written to Captain Winslow, of the United States
                            sloop Kearsarge, in the channel, a letter of which I herewith enclose a
                            copy.</p>
                        <p>I shall endeavor to see the captain of that ship personally, if possible,
                            within a day or two. The four clipper ships at Bordeaux and Nantes are
                            now all launched, and I am informed that both Arman and Voruz (the
                            builder and iron founder) express their conviction that these vessels
                            will be permitted to go out as vessels of commerce. Indeed, M. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys informed me, in our last interview, that Arman had recently seen
                            him, and, protesting that they were commercial vessels of the ordinary
                            character used in the China seas, said they would assert their right to
                            depart even against the government, and if opposition were made they
                            would present this question in the courts of justice. M. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys says that should this be done, the courts taking cognizance of
                            the question and deciding against them, the government would be without
                            remedy; its hands would be tied up by such a decision. I told him, in
                            reply, that I did not believe Arman dare present the question in a court
                            of justice; but, if he did, I thought we could, without difficulty,
                            prove his hand-writing to that paper, wherein he admitted that he was
                            building these vessels for the Confederate States. Much other
                            conversation passed on this subject, all leading to a conviction, in my
                            mind, that M. Drouyn de l’Huys had not yet definitely made up his mind
                            to the course of action which would be adopted in respect to these
                            clipper ships. On the one hand, I am disposed to believe that they are
                            willing, in good faith, to carry out their declaration that no such
                            ships shall be equipped in their ports to depredate on our commerce. On
                            the other hand, Mr. Arman is an important and influential friend of the
                            government, and his ship yard is said to be the most extensive in
                            France. They are, not unnaturally, unwilling to do anything which can
                            seriously affect his business and the business of other ship-builders
                            connected with him in these matters. * * *</p>

                                applying to the French government to get out the Rappahannock have
                                now informed him that all farther attempts for that purpose have
                                been abandoned, and that the vessel will be left to rot where she
                                is. I have no fear, therefore, of the early discharge of this
                                vessel.</p>

                            <p>The four cupper ships which are being constructed by Mr. Arman, at
                                Bordeaux and Nantes, for the confederates, are in the course of
                                rapid completion, particularly the Yeddo and Osacca, which lie at
                                Bordeaux. The Yeddo is advertised to sail for China on the 30th of
                                May, and the Osacca on the 30th of June, under pretence that they
                                are intended for the French China line. They are both confederate
                                vessels, and should be captured if possible.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Immediately upon the receipt of your
                            despatch No. 525, I applied to M. Drouyn de l’Huys for a special
                            interview, which was granted for Saturday last. I then said that I knew
                            that the French government had felt some anxiety in respect to the
                            resolution which had recently been passed by the House of
                            Representatives in reference to Mexico, and inasmuch as I had just
                            received a copy of that resolution, together with the views of the
                            President of the United States, I begged, if agreeable, to read to him
                            your despatch in reference to the latter. To this he assented, and, as
                            the shortest and most satisfactory mode of following out my
                            instructions, I read to him that entire portion of your despatch which
                            applies to this subject, stating, at the same time, that I thought it
                            was a remarkable illustration of the frankness and straight-forwardness
                            of the President. When the reading was closed, M. Drouyn de l’Huys
                            expressed his gratification, and after asking some questions in regard
                            to the effect of laying a resolution upon the table in the Senate, the
                            conversation terminated.</p>
                        <p>The extreme sensitiveness which was manifested by this government, when
                            the resolution of the House of Representatives was first brought to its
                            knowledge, has to a considerable extent subsided.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch No. 526, which gives the
                            answer to the renewed request from the French government that it may be
                            allowed to send French officers to our country for the purpose of
                            observing the military arrangements and preparations on both sides of
                            the civil war, was by me brought to the notice of Mr. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys.</p>
                        <p>I assured him of our entire willingness to receive such officers in the
                            armies of the United States, and to afford them every possible facility
                            for the examination of our works, improvements, and everything connected
                            with the progress of military art, as developed in our country; but that
                            we could not, for reasons stated in your despatch, extend that
                            concession so far as to permit <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0103"
                            />commissioners to pass our lines to make observations among the
                            insurgents. That we had, under analogous circumstances, been under the
                            necessity of refusing a like privilege to the British government, upon
                            its application. The grounds upon which you put your refusal seemed, in
                            the eyes of Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys, to relieve it from anything like want
                            of courtesy, and he said that they would at once abandon all idea of
                            sending officers to visit the southern army; but they would send
                            officers to visit the northern army, when, they doubted not, they would
                            be courteously received, as had already been the case with a number of
                            French officers. He informed me, however, that their purpose had not
                            been to send the same men to make observations inside both lines, or to
                            pass from the lines of one army to those of the other, but their purpose
                            had been to send separate officers, one to the armies of the north, and
                            the others to the armies of the south; that in the armies of the north
                            they had expected to witness improvements in the matter of gunnery, and
                            in other matters connected with the science of war, while in the south
                            they expected little more than to witness some new method of
                            facilitating the movement of troops, and the forming and moving of
                            encampments, and such general matters.</p>

                            <p>We have to communicate to you the following:</p>
                            <p>Some time since our government asked of the government of the United
                                States, through the American minister in Japan, to construct a
                                vessel-of-war.</p>
                            <p>As Japanese envoys travelling in the different countries with which
                                we have concluded treaties, and consequently having also the
                                intention of visiting yours, we have the project of making our
                                return voyage on board of the said vessel-of-war if the construction
                                of it is finished. It is on this account that we beg you to be
                                pleased to ask of your government at what period this vessel will be
                                constructed, and to send us the answer at the place where we may
                                then be.</p>
                            <p>With respect and consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In a recent conference with M. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys he complained seriously of your late action in refusing to the
                            French navy a supply of coal bought by it in New York. He says France
                            never has declared, and never will <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0105"
                            />declare coal contraband of war; that if the United States should do
                            so, it would be a retrograde move, inasmuch as its traditional policy
                            had always been in favor of neutrals and in limitation rather than in
                            extension of the list of contraband. He hopes that we will not retrace
                            our steps, but, in this matter, adhere to our past policy; that France
                            has always gone with us, or we with her, on these questions of maritime
                            law, and he does not think it for the interest of either country to part
                            company; at least, that was the inference from his language.</p>
                        <p>He informed me, further, that your opinion was understood to be favorable
                            to letting the coal go to the French vessels, but difficulty was made by
                            the Secretary of the Treasury. I told him, if this were so, there might
                            be some question connected with the revenue which had interfered, but he
                            thought otherwise, and said that it was made to rest purely upon the
                            question, is coal contraband of war? This is a question of deep interest
                            to the French government—deeper, perhaps, than to us, she having a large
                            navy and <hi rend="italic">little coal,</hi> while Great Britain and the
                            United States have an abundance of the latter article.</p>
                        <p>He said, further, that if the United States should declare coal
                            contraband of war, it would place France in a false position in
                            reference to our country. That she, France, holding coal not to be
                            contraband, would be compelled to supply it to our enemies in time of
                            war, and to the confederates, while denying it to us because we denied
                            it to them. That they would dislike much to be placed in a position
                            indicating such apparent want of neutrality, yet, that it would be
                            inevitable if coal was declared by us contraband of war.</p>
                        <p>There is a good deal of sensitiveness manifested here on this point. M.
                            Rouher, minister of state, referred to it, I observe, in his late speech
                            in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have explained to M. Drouyn de l’Huys
                            the reason why it would not be agreeable, at the present time, to permit
                            French officers to visit and make observations within the lines of the
                            army of the Potomac, and have stated to him, confidentially, the reason
                            why you had suspended the leave granted to take the tobacco from
                            Richmond. He seemed satisfied with the explanations in both cases,
                            especially as I told him the leave was not absolutely withdrawn, but
                            only suspended. He said, in reference to the tobacco, that the fault had
                            been partly their own, inasmuch as they had been guilty of unnecessary
                            delay in acting upon the privilege we had extended to them. He said that
                            they should have sent their vessels sooner.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: At a special interview accorded to me on
                            Saturday last, M. Drouyn de l’Huys informed me, not only that those two
                            iron-clads, now being constructed <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0106"
                            />by Arman, at Bordeaux, under contract with the confederates, had been
                            positively sold to a neutral power, but he assured me distinctly that
                            the four clipper ships in the course of construction at Bordeaux and
                            Nantes, under a like contract, should not be delivered to the
                            confederates. As two of these vessels are approaching completion, I
                            confess I was much gratified by receiving this distinct assurance. His
                            language was most explicit, and I thanked him accordingly.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Rappahannock is yet in wait at Calais,
                            and the Georgia, as you will have seen, has gone into the port of
                            Liverpool.</p>
                        <p>On Saturday last I left with the ministry of foreign affairs some
                            additional evidence as to the character of the Rappahannock, recently
                            supplied to me by Mr. Morse, our consul at London, to wit: His own
                            certificate that he had compared the copies with the originals, &amp;c.
                            A copy of the affidavit of James Graham, dated 4th April last. A copy of
                            the appointments, by Captain Campbell, of Wm. Alexander Bradshaw and
                            Joseph Buchanan, as third assistant engineers in the confederate navy,
                            from the 7th of February, 1864. A copy of letter of attorney from Joseph
                            Buchanan to Messrs. Jones &amp; Co., to receive part of his pay,
                            &amp;c., dated 2d February, 1864. The copy of a long affidavit, by James
                            Graham, dated 4th April, 1864. This evidence has been doubtless
                            forwarded to you from London.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Publications which have recently been made
                            at Paris have excited apprehensions that the rams which are building at
                            Nantes under the direction of Mr. Arman, a member of Chamber of
                            Deputies, are likely to receive armaments and go to sea to make war
                            against the United States. Having heretofore submitted what was believed
                            conclusive evidence, that the vessels were being built under a contract
                            with rebel agents for this unlawful and piratical purpose, and for no
                            other, and having received from time to time assurances from the
                            imperial government that they would not be allowed to be used in
                            executing this purpose, it is not without surprise as well as deep
                            concern that we learn that the vessels have been launched, and that,
                            without any known change of ownership or destination, they are being
                            prepared for sea by French subjects in a port of the empire. It is
                            confidently believed that either the statements to which I have referred
                            are exaggerated, or else that the completion and preparation of the
                            vessels for war against the United States are carried on fraudulently so
                            as to escape the vigilance of the imperial government. Nevertheless the
                            occasion is one of such serious import that I find myself obliged to ask
                            you to suggest to M. Drouyn de l’Huys that the subject is deemed one
                            which calls for serious attention and satisfactory explanation.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch of the 2d of May, No. 460. You will please
                            express to Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys a high satisfaction on the part of this
                            government with the information he has given you, that the Rappahannock
                            will not be allowed to enter the piratical service of the enemies of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>I have carefully read the portions of your despatch which relate to the
                            four war vessels which are being built at Nantes and Bordeaux, by Arman
                            and Voruz, for the insurgent service. You have been already apprised
                            that this government is disturbed by the rumors it hears from Arman and
                            from his confederates of this country, that these vessels are at last to
                            be allowed by the French government to go to sea. Indeed you were
                            instructed in my No. 553 to ask full explanations, and to assure M.
                            Drouyn de l’Huys that the subject is deemed by the President worthy
                            serious attention on the part of the Emperor’s government. The
                            conversation of M. Drouyn de l’Huys, which you have since reported to me
                            was held before you could have received the instruction last mentioned.
                            That conversation has not produced any abatement of the apprehensions
                            before entertained; but it has on the other hand increased them.</p>
                        <p>I have, therefore, to renew the instructions. You will say to M. Drouyn
                            de l’Huys, if you find it necessary, that this government could not look
                            with indifference upon the building and despatching of hostile vessels
                            from the ports of France.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of May 2, No. 462, has been
                            received. Mr. Geofroy has communicated to me the wishes of the French
                            government in regard to the visit of officers of the French army for the
                            purpose of observation. I have already informed you that at the
                            beginning of this campaign the Secretary of War, upon the suggestion of
                            the lieutenant general commanding the forces, declined to allow any
                            visitors to enter the camps of the army actually engaged. The
                            restriction, I believe, still remains. But the occasion for it will
                            probably pass away soon, and it is probable that it will then be
                            removed.</p>

                            there, and even threatened with imprisonment. You will make a proper

                            France, and will state to him that due reparation will be expected by
                            this government. As the correspondence speaks for itself, no inquiry as
                            to the facts of the case would seem to be necessary.</p>

                                commandant of this place on the 25th instant; also a copy of my
                                reply thereto, (No. 3,) which was written and sent to that officer
                                thirty minutes after the receipt of his first note, (marked No. 1,)
                                although it was received at twilight.</p>
                            <p>My clerk went to and returned from the office of the commandant three
                                times, without finding him, for the purpose of putting him in
                                possession of the above-mentioned reply.</p>
                            <p>At the hour of 9.30 p. m. I received the second note, (No. 2,)
                                menacing me with imprisonment, and, without knowing its contents, I
                                sent him the reply, (No. 3,) after which I was not molested.</p>
                            <p>The opportune arrival of the United States steamer Kanawha, Captain
                                Taylor, off this bar on the following morning had the effect to
                                soften the temper of this imperious superior commandant; still, I
                                consider it my duty to submit this case to your decision, indulging
                                the hope that redress for this outrage will be speedily demanded by

                                    present date, I have the honor to state to you that the only
                                    persons I am aware of who have arrived in this city are those
                                    that came in on yesterday, viz: Charles E. Johnson, William
                                    Garret, and Lewis Davison, seamen, and five passengers—the names
                                    of the latter I have not as yet ascertained—all of whom are from
                                    the American schooner E. D. McClenahan, G. R. Edgett, master,
                                    which vessel was lately wrecked near Soto la Marina on her
                                    passage from New Orleans for this port.</p>
                                <p>These persons are doubtless peaceable; but if I should hear of
                                    anything to the contrary, they will not receive any countenance
                                    or protection from this consulate.</p>

                            inclusive, are received. Neither of these, however, seem to contemplate
                            a reply.</p>
                        <p>Our consul at Nantes has for some time past been much excited by the
                            knowledge that a shipment of cannon (62 in number) has been made by Mr.
                            Voruz, of that place, on an English ship, (the Medusa,) which he
                            believed were intended for the confederates, or at least for the
                            armament of some of those vessels now being built for the confederates
                            in French ports. These reports may have been communicated to your
                            department, or to that of the navy. I take occasion, therefore, to
                            inform you that I am satisfied this shipment of cannon has another
                            destination than that of the insurgent States. I am confidentially
                            informed that they are for a government of this continent, and need not
                            occasion us any anxiety.</p>

                            <p>M. the minister of the United States has again called the attention
                                of the minister of foreign affairs to the alleged arrest of Mr.
                                Mansfield, consular agent of the United States at Tabasco.</p>
                            <p>Up to the present moment M. Drouyn de l’Huys is unable to add
                                anything to the communication which he has already addressed to Mr.
                                Dayton on this subject. He took care, as he announced to him, to
                                write to Vera Cruz to obtain some explanation of this affair, on the
                                subject of which nothing had reached either his department or those
                                of the war and the navy; but the time which has passed since the
                                departure of this request for information in Mexico is not
                                sufficient to have been able to receive an answer.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, it appears from a communication from Mr. Seward to
                                the chargé d’affaires of his Imperial Majesty that the cabinet of
                                Washington had itself no positive information upon the fact which
                                had been reported to it; that it was from this motive more
                                particularly that it had directed M. the minister of the United
                                States at Paris to make inquiries as to what the French government
                                might have received. It is the same desire to be better informed
                                upon the incident in question which had decided it to send a federal
                                vessel to seek upon the spot some surer information.</p>

                            de l’Huys, his Imperial Majesty’s secretary of state for foreign
                            affairs, had stated to you not only that those two iron-clad vessels now
                            being constructed by Arman, at Bordeaux, under contract with the
                            insurgents, had been positively sold to a neutral power, but that his
                            excellency assured you distinctly that the four clipper ships in the
                            course of construction at Bordeaux and Nantes, under the like contract,
                            should not be delivered to the so-called confederates.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received your despatch of May 16,
                            No. 465, in which you communicated to me the remarks of M. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys on the subject of the prohibition of the exportation of
                            anthracite coals for the use of the French navy in the Gulf. At the time
                            when M. Drouyn de l’Huys made these complaints he was probably unaware
                            that the proceedings upon which the complaints were founded had been
                            modified to the mutual satisfaction of the French chargé d’affaires here
                            and this government. The occasion for the remarks having thus passed,
                            the question which arose out of it has now become purely speculative.
                            From this view it does not seem important to discuss them new. I shall
                            remain content with saying that the remarks of M. Drouyn de l’Huys seem
                            to me to have been made under a misapprehension of the facts in the
                            case, and of the principles and policy of this government.</p>

                            Nantes, informs me that the government has censured him for not
                            reporting to it the confederate ships being built at that place. I deem
                            it but just to Mr. de la Montagnie to say he has been exceedingly
                            diligent and constant in his reports to this legation. I requested him,
                            at an early day, to keep me well advised of everything of interest with
                            these vessels, that I might be in condition at any moment to appeal to
                            the French government. This he has faithfully done. It is true I did not
                            anticipate that he would altogether cease his reports to the government
                            at home; but I suppose he thought I would myself report, as I have done,
                            all in reference to these ships and their progress which I thought the
                            government would care to know, and he has doubtless supposed additional
                            reports from him were unnecessary.</p>

                            is especially interesting, conflicting, as it does, with the general
                            accounts given in the newspapers. The newspapers all inform us that Lee
                            is yet intrenched at Spottsylvania and north of the Po, while your
                            despatch states explicitly that he has been driven to the south of the
                            Po, and a portion of his defences there wrested from him. This
                            difference is the difference between a temporary check at least and a
                            successful advance. I await further news with the most intense
                            anxiety.</p>
                        <p>Your despatch, No. 551, in reference to Spain and Peru, I answer

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I yesterday communicated to Mr. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys the contents of your despatch, No. 551, in reference to the
                            difficulties which have arisen between Peru and Spain. He assured me
                            that the government of the Emperor would cheerfully advise the peaceful
                            settlement of these questions, and that it had already done so to the
                            Spanish ambassador at this court. In reference to your suggestion, that,
                            in the present condition of things, it was desirable that a new effort
                            should be made by the French government to avert the occurrence of war
                            between Spain and Peru, and restore amicable relations between them, he
                            said that he would, by their very next courier to Madrid, send an
                            earnest despatch to that government, counselling and sincerely advising
                            it to settle their difficulty with Peru in a spirit of peace, and
                            without resort to war. He said that France did not assume to judge who
                            was right and who was wrong in the controversies that had arisen, and
                            could go no further, therefore, than earnestly and in good faith urge
                            its counsel. He had, it would seem, already had communication with the
                            Spanish government, and was informed by it that they did not seek in
                            Peru the acquisition of any territory, &amp;c.; that they required only
                            a settlement which would satisfy their honor, &amp;c. These
                            generalities, of course, amount to nothing.</p>
                        <p>At the request of the Peruvian minister at this court I telegraphed on
                            Wednesday to Mr. Koerner, at Madrid, to know if the existing government
                            there approved of the action of its officials in the Pacific, in seizing
                            the Chincha islands, &amp;c.; and last night I received from him by
                            telegraph the following answer: “Government will not approve, unless
                            official information, not received yet, vary facts reported.—<hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Koerner,</hi> United States Minister.”</p>
                        <p>The French government, in all these questions, consults first and last
                            its own political policy, and one of its lines of policy is, as
                            supposed, to keep its relations good with Spain; so that, in the event
                            of trouble on the continent, its enemies may be in front, and everything
                            peaceful and quiet behind it. Its present influence with Spain is
                            believed to be great; and inasmuch as that government is now vacillating
                            or hesitating as to its course of action in respect to Peru, the
                            minister of Peru at this court thinks it possible that the interference
                            or counsel of France, if frankly given in favor of a peaceful solution
                            of the question, may determine the result. * * * * * *</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatches, from No. 554 to No. 559,
                            both inclusive, and despatch No. 561, were received last night. I this
                            morning went to the Foreign Office, and had a long interview with M.
                            Drouyn de l’Huys, principally in reference to the vessels at Bordeaux
                            and Nantes. After carefully examining your despatch, No. 553, I made up
                            my mind that it was best, under all the circumstances, to read it to him
                            entire, and I did so. The rams in question are being constructed at
                            Bordeaux, and not at Nantes, as you state in that despatch; but that
                            does not affect the question. There are two clipper ships, or
                            privateers, being constructed at Nantes, and two at Bordeaux, under Mr.
                            Annan’s direction, for the confederates. I then communicated to M.
                            Drouyn de l’Huys so much of the substance of your despatches, No. 554
                            and the confidential despatch No. 556, as applied to these vessels now
                            being built at Bordeaux and Nantes. The rams, you will recollect, M.
                            Rouber, minister of state, said, in a speech in the Chamber of Deputies,
                            should not be delivered to the confederates. I had already informed M.
                            Drouyn de l’Huys of the Very serious character of these questions, and
                            the probable consequences which would result from the completion and
                            delivery of these vessels to the confederates. I have, on all occasions,
                            used strong language when applied to these questions. I told him to-day
                            that, in expressing the views of the President on this subject, I could
                            scarcely speak with the necessary earnestness and directness, without
                            trenching on that respectful forbearance of language to which I desired
                            at all times to limit myself in our official intercourse. I told him
                            that, should these vessels pass into the hands of the confederates,
                            become armed and commence a system of depredation on our commerce, the
                            exasperation would be such that the government, if so disposed, (which I
                            did not intimate that it would be,) could scarcely keep the peace
                            between the two countries.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In a recent despatch, No. 467, I informed
                            you that Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys had assured me that the iron-clad rams at
                            Bordeaux had been disposed of to a neutral power, and that I might rest
                            assured that the other four vessels building there should not go into
                            the possession of the confederates. As these assurances were very
                            explicit, they relieved me, for the time being, from much anxiety; but
                            our consul at Bordeaux recently informed me that one of these vessels
                            was about to leave port, on the 6th or 7th of this month, and I then
                            recollected that the above assurances were all verbal, and liable to be
                            misunderstood or controverted. I thought that, in announcing the fact of
                            the early departure of this vessel to M. Drouyn de l’Huys in writing, I
                            would refer to what he had in conversation said to me on this subject. I
                            did so, and herewith send you a copy of my communication, marked A. In
                            reply, I received a communication from him, a translation of which I
                            send you herewith, marked B. This reply not being satisfactory, but, as
                            it seemed to me, in opposition to, <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0116"
                            />or at least in restriction of the verbal assurances he had given me, I
                            addressed him another communication, a copy of which, marked C, I send
                            you. To this I have, of course, received as yet no written reply. In the
                            mean time I was telegraphed that Mr. Morse, our consul at London, said
                            that orders were about being issued to discharge the Rappahannock, and
                            my anxiety on the whole subject was such that I went this morning
                            immediately to the Foreign Office to see if the facts were as stated,
                            and, if so, whether some change could not be made in the condition of
                            things. M. Drouyn de l’Huys opened the conversation at once by telling
                            me that the two vessels, Yeddo and Osacca, were sold in Holland, not to
                            the government, but to a neutral, and <hi rend="italic">they were to be
                                delivered at Amsterdam,</hi> unarmed. I made to him the same or like
                            suggestions as contained in my communication, letter C. He said he had
                            fully examined the contract of sale, and that the same was entirely
                            regular, and this government could not, under the circumstances, prevent
                            their delivery. It had no right to do so; if they did, they would be
                            responsible in damages to the parties injured. In response to my remark,
                            that it was probably a sham sale, a mere cover to get the vessels into
                            the hands of the confederates, he said no, he was entirely satisfied the
                            sale was in good faith. He added, that he could not swear to it, of
                            course, but his “conviction” was that it was so. He was, satisfied, he
                            said, that the transaction was a fair one, and that the vessels would
                            not go to the confederates, and we would never receive detriment from
                            them. Still he said, he did not ask us to relax at all in our vigilance.
                            I asked him of what possible use vigilance could be, when we had not
                            even the slightest idea who it was alleged had bought these vessels. He
                            then said simply, they were sold to a house in Holland, and to be
                            delivered at Amsterdam. Mr. Forbes, who had conversation with him on the
                            same subject, informs me he said to him, “a respectable house” in
                            Holland, &amp;c. As I was about leaving, he said he <hi rend="italic"
                                >had known</hi> the name of the house, (implying of course, that it
                            was now forgotten,) and that he would endeavor to get it again, and let
                            me know it; but I do not expect to receive it.</p>
                        <p>I endeavored to impress upon the mind of M. Drouyn de l’Huys the serious
                            consequences which would follow the escape of these vessels, and their
                            passage into the hands of the confederates as privateers. He said he had
                            no wish for that, and did not at all believe it would occur. He added,
                            that if they wished to help the south, they certainly would not attempt
                            it in this petty, indirect way, but they <hi rend="italic">would
                                acknowledge</hi> them at once. He said that would do them a
                            substantial service; it would give them a position and standing among
                            nations; but this petty mode of proceeding, with a view to help the
                            south, would be unworthy of a great nation like France, and amount to
                            nothing. That to permit them to buy some ships of Mr. Arman, paying a
                                <hi rend="italic">full</hi> price, would have no serious effect on
                            the war in the United States, while it would exasperate the north, and
                            bring no thanks, no gratitude, from the south. No, said he, if we
                            purpose aiding the south, we would say that we could not look upon this
                            war, which has now lasted between three and four years, as an ordinary
                            rebellion, and that the south was entitled to recognition; and we would
                            recognize them and abide the consequences. But he said they had no wish
                            or purpose to aid the south, but would maintain their neutrality; and in
                            permitting these vessels to be delivered to a neutral in Holland, they
                            did only what they were bound by law to do.</p>
                        <p>After conversing with Mr. Forbes and another intelligent business man,
                            (Mr. Beckwith, a brother-in-law of M. Forbes,) both having some
                            knowledge of Holland and its business relations, I told Mr. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys that if these vessels were permitted to go out of the French
                            ports, (against which I protested, of course,) I would prefer they
                            should be taken to Amsterdam under command of French officers, or with a
                            French escort, and not trusted to the promise of the parties to take the
                            vessels there. If the latter were done, I feared the <pb n="97"
                                xml:id="pg_97" facs="0117"/>vessels would go immediately to sea, and
                            we might lose an opportunity of further interfering with them; to which
                            Mr. Forbes and Mr. Beckwith attached some importance. He said he would
                            consult the minister of marine on the subject.</p>
                        <p>I thought M. Drouyn de l’Huys was rather disposed to find fault with late
                            proceedings of our government. He referred again to your refusal of coal
                            to their fleet, and to your giving up, as he said, to be hanged, the
                            secretary of Vidaurri, who had fled to Brownsville for protection,
                            although now there was scarcely a war against France in Mexico—nothing
                            against them but some roving marauding bands. He said, too, after their
                            military officers were on the ocean to visit our country, with a view to
                            examine what was to be seen there, and with our assent and assurance of
                            welcome, they were then informed that <hi rend="italic">this line</hi>
                            or <hi rend="italic">that</hi> could not be examined. M. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys said it would have been more agreeable if notice had been sooner
                            given, &amp;c., &amp;c. I could not but feel that this querulousness was
                            in part the result of a consciousness that we, and not they, really had
                            just cause of complaint. He was disposed to anticipate me in these
                            matters—to complain rather than be complained of.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Ministre</hi>: After recent
                                assurances from your excellency that the iron-clads at Bordeaux had
                                certainly been sold to a neutral government, and that the
                                clipper-ships at that port and at Nantes should not be delivered to
                                the confederates, I have given them little or no further attention;
                                but our consul at Bordeaux, having reported to me on yesterday that
                                the Yeddo will steam out to sea on Monday or Tuesday next, (6th or
                                7th instant,) although the work on her is not finished, I have
                                thought it advisable to apprise your excellency of the fact. I had
                                not supposed it possible, from what I had understood from other

                                letter which you did me the honor to write me on the subject of the
                                approaching departure from Bordeaux of the steam corvette Yeddo. The
                                builder of this ship has proved before me the regular sale in
                                Holland of this vessel, and of another corvette, Osacca, coming from
                                his ship yards, and which, both the one and the other, are to be
                                handed over to their purchasers at Amsterdam. After examination of
                                the contracts <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0118"/>produced, the
                                government of the Emperor has no right to prevent the going out of
                                the vessels in question, and their delivery to neutrals, in an
                                unarmed condition, at the place where they are to be handed over to

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Ministre</hi>: I have the honor to
                                acknowledge the receipt last evening of the letter from your
                                excellency, dated 6th instant, informing me that the constructor of
                                the Yeddo and Osacca, the two clipper ships built at Bordeaux, had
                                proved before your excellency the regular sale of those vessels in
                                Holland, to be delivered at Amsterdam.</p>
                            <p>I much regret to seem to be at all importunate upon the subject of
                                these vessels, but their importance to the interests of the United
                                States, and its good relations with France, is such that I prefer
                                subjecting myself to this charge rather than incur the imputation of
                                inattention or indifference. I cannot, moreover, divest myself of a
                                feeling of distrust in regard to the bona fides of a sale by the
                                constructor of these vessels. I remember that they were built under
                                a contract for the confederates, and that they <hi rend="italic"
                                    >have been paid for</hi> to a great extent, if not entirely, by
                                the confederates; written evidence of both which facts is in
                                possession of your excellency. Their build and construction, I am
                                credibly informed by persons acquainted with vessels and the trade
                                in the China seas, for which it is alleged they were built, are not
                                such as are usual for commercial vessels in those seas, or, indeed,
                                anywhere else. I remember, too, that they have had port-holes, now
                                closed, but easily knocked open when at sea, and ready to receive an
                                armament. I remember, too, that the constructor has already been
                                detected in the most gross misstatements in regard to the sale first
                                to Denmark, then to Sweden, of some of the vessels built under these
                                contracts for the confederates. The statement now is, if I
                                understand your letter aright, that these vessels are not sold to a
                                government, but to individuals; the untruthfulness and bad faith of
                                which sale, if it exist, it is difficult, if not impossible, to
                                trace. Holland has East India possessions, and these may afford a
                                plausible pretext to get these vessels into the Pacific, where, it
                                is said, the confederates want them.</p>
                            <p>This, you will recollect, is the same course of proceeding adopted by
                                the confederates in respect to the two rams built for them in
                                England. After all the pretences of ownership in foreign governments
                                had failed them, they then said the rams had been sold to Mr.
                                Bravay. I know how difficult it is to prove a negative, or to
                                disprove the bona fides of a sale, when, as in this case, the papers
                                may be regular; but I should like, if agreeable to your excellency,
                                to have the opportunity. If, therefore, I may without impropriety
                                ask it, and no objection occur to the mind of your excellency, I
                                will esteem it a favor if you will communicate to me the names and
                                residence of the alleged purchasers of these vessels.</p>
                            <p>I seize this occasion to renew to your excellency the assurances of
                                highest consideration with which I have the honor to be your very

                            ultimo, No. 557, and to its accompaniments relative to the rude
                            treatment of Mr. Chase, the United States consul at Tampico, by the
                            French military commandant there, I now transmit a copy of a further
                            despatch from Mr. Chase of the 10th ultimo, No. 21, which gives a more
                            detailed account of the matter. I need only say that the aggression on
                            the consul, for which you can ask reparation, is the menace contained in
                            the second note of the French commandant to Mr. Chase.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 27th ultimo I had the honor to
                                address a letter to you on the subject of two notes sent to me by
                                the French superior commandant of this place, with which I enclosed
                                copies of the said notes and copy of my reply to the first. A press
                                of business on this consulate, and the prompt despatch of the
                                British steamer’s mail, prevented me from sending a full report and
                                the requisite translations, an omission which I now beg leave to
                                supply, with the following explanations and enclosures.</p>
                            <p>From the outset of the French intervention with this country I have
                                carefully pursued a strictly neutral course, and every American
                                citizen residing in this place has followed my advice and example;
                                and up to the present moment not one of them has been accused of
                                meddling in the political or military affairs of the country. In the
                                mean time I have firmly defended their just rights, but invariably
                                manifesting a conciliatory disposition.</p>
                            <p>You will please perceive that in the first note of the French
                                commandant he demands the names of certain individuals, who, he
                                alleges, entered this city on that day, (April 25,) and endeavored
                                to hold me responsible for their moral conduct. That note was
                                written in the French language, and not delivered to me until
                                twilight on the day of its date; and, notwithstanding the
                                unseasonable hour, I obtained a verbal translation and sent my reply
                                to it in thirty minutes after its receipt; but, my clerk not finding
                                him in his office, went and returned with it three consecutive times
                                without finding him. At 9.30 p. m. I received the second note, and,
                                not knowing its contents, I again sent my reply to the first.</p>
                            <p>The second note was so written as to leave me in doubt whether the
                                threat of imprisonment extended to me or not, and under that doubt I
                                called at an early hour on the commandant and pointed out the
                                impropriety of his attempt to hold me responsible for the conduct of
                                any persons entering this place. He excused himself on the plea of
                                alarming reports there were in circulation.</p>
                            <p>In this state of affairs Captain Taylor, of the United States steamer
                                Kanawha, happily arrived here, and, fearing that the appearance of
                                that vessel might excite some real alarm, I lost no time in
                                presenting that officer to the commandant, who courteously reported
                                the presence of his vessel.</p>
                            <p>On my return to my office I had a careful perusal of the second note,
                                and ascertained that the threat of imprisonment was actually made
                                against me, and I felt much regret that I had paid these visits.</p>
                            <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0120"/>
                            <p>The individuals who entered this city were those mentioned in my
                                reply to the commandant, all of whom were duly reported to the
                                captain of the port. Among the passengers there was only one
                                American citizen.</p>
                            <p>I did not think it proper to reply to the second note from the
                                commandant, but I expressed my astonishment at its contents to the
                                acting French consul at this port, remarking at the same time that
                                no difficulty was pending between our respective governments, and
                                that it behooved the authorities here not to provoke any.</p>
                            <p>Shortly after that conversation the consul was sent to me with a
                                message from the commandant offering to retire his notes. In reply,
                                I stated that if the commandant felt any regret for his conduct
                                towards me, and was willing to offer an apology in writing, I would
                                take much satisfaction in forwarding it to my government, as the
                                affair was now too serious to be decided by this consulate.</p>
                            <p>This offer was declined, and I now respectfully beg leave to submit
                                this plain statement of the case to you, believing that you will
                                consider it of sufficient importance to take measures for obtaining
                                redress for this unprovoked wrong and security for my future
                                protection.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, with great esteem and respect, your most
                                obedient servant,</p>

                            the committee of jurisconsults, who had been consulted by him; although,
                            as the Senate had now adjourned, and Mr. Troplong, the president, who is
                            chairman of this committee, would be at leisure, he might expect an

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am just informed, in a private way, that
                            suggestions for another effort are about being made between England and
                            France to bring about peace in our country. No formal or official
                            suggestion has been made from either side, nor is it supposed will be,
                            and M. Drouyn de l’Huys says, I am informed, that he knows nothing about
                            it; but it is reported to me as a fact officiously, <pb n="101"
                                xml:id="pg_101" facs="0121"/>though not officially, resolved upon.
                            Of course it is said that this effort is to be of the most conciliatory
                            character, &amp;c. I have had so many advices and reports of this kind
                            that I have lost faith in them, and do not permit them to disturb me;
                            but I have been advised, for some time past, that something was stirring
                            in reference to our affairs, and there may be more truth in this report
                            than some that have gone before it.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I was on Saturday telegraphed by our
                            consular agent at Cherbourg that a confederate vessel (supposed to be
                            the Florida) had just anchored in that harbor. Some two or three hours
                            later in the day he telegraphed me as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The rebel steamer is the Alabama, with thirty-seven federal prisoners.
                            She has captured ship Rockingham, of New York, and a bark, off Cape of
                            Good Hope.</p>
                        <p rend="right">“EDWARD LIAIS, <hi rend="italic">Vice Consul.</hi>”</p>
                        <p>I immediately telegraphed Captain Winslow, of United States ship
                            Kearsarge, now at Flushing. Captain Winslow has replied to me that “he
                            will be off Cherbourg about Wednesday.” * * * I likewise immediately
                            enclosed to M. Drouyn de l’Huys minister of foreign affairs, a note of
                            protest of like character as that made in the cases of the Florida and
                            Georgia, a copy of which is herewith enclosed. I thought under all the
                            circumstances it might be better not to neglect this, though the policy
                            of the French government had been announced in the case of the other
                            vessels. But I remembered that on one occasion when, in the course of
                            conversation about these vessels, I said to M. Drouyn de l’Huys they
                            needed but one ship more (the Alabama) to make the French ports a
                            rendezvous for the entire rebel navy, and I thought she would next be
                            here, he hastily said, “M., I will not permit that vessel to come in.”
                            It is just to say that this was not said by him, nor received by me, as
                            a deliberate promise; it seemed rather an impulse, an outbreak of
                            annoyance at the use their ports were being put to, which he truly
                            remarked could not be the result of accident, but was obviously intended
                            to beget trouble between France and the United States. Still the
                            character of this vessel is so obnoxious, and so notorious, that it is
                            possible they may exclude her; but, if otherwise, it is well to know and
                            understand that they will apply their rules in the most extreme cases.
                            If they act upon these principles they can scarcely complain if we, in
                            return, when occasion shall arise, apply the same to themselves.</p>
                        <p>If any increase of our naval force on this coast is contemplated, as your
                            late despatch informs me, I hope that as little delay in sending it may
                            occur as possible. The arrival of the Alabama will spread universal
                            dismay among American shippers in these seas and all engaged in American
                            trade.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As soon as the blind apologists of the
                                sophisms and prejudices of another epoch roused the passions and
                                interests of the government near which you are accredited, producing
                                the unjustifiable invasion of which the Mexican territory is at
                                present the theatre, we comprehended the new field which presented
                                itself to the human race to continue its conquests of progress, of
                                improvement, and of perfection, to which it incessantly aspires in
                                compliance with laws which nothing can impede.</p>
                            <p>Abstracting ourselves from selfish thoughts, we enter in good faith
                                on the path of investigation, seeking the rules of morality, the
                                dogmas of philosophy, the precepts of justice, on which might hang
                                the pretext for overthrowing our independence, destroying our
                                institutions, stifling our opinions, and casting around our necks
                                the chains forged beforehand in the workshops of France. We must
                                confess, Mr. Minister, that neither in morality, nor in reason, nor
                                in justice, nor in history, nor in the annals of humanity, do we
                                find a single word which can justify so vast an outrage, but without
                                much effort we find that it rested on our wretchedness and on our
                                weakness, because we have labored enough in demolishing the ancient
                                edifice which social conditions were repugnant to burying beneath
                                its ruins the rights of the citizen in order to build up a new
                                edifice where might eternally dwell the rights of man. There was,
                                therefore, no room for hesitation; the sword is not argument. In
                                this idea, grasping ours in one hand, and bearing aloft in the other
                                the sublime tablet of the rights of man, convinced that an assault
                                upon the nationality of one people is an assault upon that of every
                                people, we gave a beginning to the struggle. Victory smiled on us
                                awhile, notwithstanding that our adversary to his indisputable
                                knowledge in the art of war, knowledge very superior to ours, added
                                    <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0123"/>deception and perfidy
                                in order to conquer us. At length, at Puebla, we succumbed to the
                                superiority of physical force, and came to this country in the
                                character of prisoners of war of France.</p>
                            <p>We are in the firm conviction that in proportion as we strip
                                ourselves of our prejudices and of our privlieges, reason resumes
                                her place and civilization is aggrandized—not that civilization
                                whose electric shock produces the shock of arms, but that whose
                                torch is kindled in the conscience of the people. We, in
                                consequence, think that wars of ambition and of conquest are no
                                longer possible; those of emancipation and of liberty can alone take
                                place until the time arrive in which there can be no material forces
                                which can contend with moral force. The enlightened and magnanimous
                                American people thinks as we do, and although tormented by a civil
                                war whose end will be the security of the rights and immunities of
                                man, does not, on that account, remain indifferent in a strife which
                                affects its interests.</p>
                            <p>Even here we have heard its protest, and considering it to be an
                                unavoidable duty which gratitude counsels that your government
                                should know the sincere and profound sentiments of admiration and
                                respect with which we are inspired by the virtues of the people of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You will, doubtless, have received, before
                            this, notice of the arrival of the Alabama in the port of Cherbourg, and
                            my protest to this government against the extension of any
                            accommodations to this vessel. M. Drouyn de l’Huys yesterday informed me
                            that they had made up their minds to this course, and he gave me a copy
                            of the written directions, given by the minister of marine to the
                            vice-admiral, maritime prefect at Cherbourg, a translation of which
                            accompanies this despatch. But he, at the same time, informed me that
                            the United States ship-of-war the Kearsarge had appeared off the port of
                            Cherbourg, and there was danger of an immediate fight between those
                            vessels. That the Alabama professes its entire readiness to meet the
                            Kearsarge, and he believed that each would attack the other as soon as
                            they were three miles off the coast. That a sea fight would thus be got
                            up in the face of France, and at a distance from their coast within
                            reach of the guns used on shipboard in these days. That the distance to
                            which the neutral right of an adjoining government extended itself from
                            the coast was unsettled, and that the reason of the old rules, which
                            assumed that three miles was the outermost reach of a cannon shot, no
                            longer existed, and that, in a word, a fight on or about such a distance
                            from their coast <hi rend="italic">would be offensive to the dignity of
                                France,</hi> and they would <hi rend="italic">not permit it.</hi> I
                            told him that no other rule than the three-mile rule was known or
                            recognized as a principle of international law; but if a fight were to
                            take place, and we would lose nothing and risk nothing by its being
                            further off, I had, of course, no objection. I had no wish to wound the
                            susceptibilities of France by getting up a fight within a distance which
                            made the cannon shot liable to fall on her coast. I asked him if he
                            would put his views and wishes on this question in writing, and he
                            promised me to do so. I wrote to Captain Winslow this morning, and
                            herewith enclose you a copy of my letter. I have carefully avoided in
                            this communication anything which would tend to make the Kearsarge risk
                            anything by yielding what seemed to me an admitted right.</p>
                        <p>To deliver this letter, and understand some other matters in respect to
                            the alleged sale of the clipper ships at Bordeaux, I have sent my son to

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: This will be delivered to you by my
                                son and assistant secretary of legation. I have had a conversation
                                this afternoon with M. Drouyn de l’Huys, minister of foreign
                                affairs. He says they have given the Alabama notice that she must
                                leave Cherbourg; but in the mean time you have come in and are
                                watching the Alabama, and that this vessel is anxious to meet you,
                                and he supposes you will attack her as soon as she gets three miles
                                off the coast. That this will produce a fight which will be at best
                                a fight in waters which may or may not be French waters, as accident
                                may determine. That it would be <hi rend="italic">offensive to the
                                    dignity of France</hi> to have a fight under such circumstances,
                                and France will <hi rend="italic">not permit it.</hi> That the
                                Alabama shall not attack you, nor you her, within the three miles,
                                or on or about that distance off. Under such circumstances I do not
                                suppose that they would have, on principles of international law,
                                the least right to interfere with you if three miles off the coast;
                                but if you lose nothing by fighting six or seven miles off the coast
                                instead of three, you had best do so. You know better than I (who
                                have little or no knowledge of the relative strength of the <pb
                                    n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0125"/>two vessels) whether the
                                pretence of the Alabama of a readiness to meet you is more than a
                                pretence, and I do not wish you to sacrifice any advantage if you
                                have it. I suggest only that you avoid all <hi rend="italic"
                                    >unnecessary</hi> trouble with France; but if the Alabama can be
                                taken without violating any rules of international law, and may be
                                lost if such a principle is yielded, you know what the government
                                would expect of you. You will, of course, yield no real advantage to
                                which you are entitled, while you are careful to so act as to make,
                                    <hi rend="italic">uselessly,</hi> no unnecessary complications
                                with the government. I ought to add that Mr. Seward’s despatch,
                                dated May 20, 1864, was in the following words: “The Niagara will
                                proceed with as much despatch as possible to cruise in European
                                waters, and that the Dictator, so soon as she shall be ready for
                                sea, (which is expected to be quite soon,) will follow her, unless,
                                in the mean time, advices from yourself and Mr. Adams shall be
                                deemed to furnish reasons for a change of purpose in that respect.”
                                That you may understand exactly the condition of things here in
                                regard to the Alabama, I send you herewith a copy of a communication
                                from the minister of marine of the naval prefect at Cherbourg,
                                furnished me by the minister of foreign affairs.</p>

                                <p>We cannot permit the Alabama to enter into one of our basins of
                                    the arsenal, that not being indispensable to place it in a state
                                    to go again to sea. This vessel can address itself to commerce,
                                    (commercial accommodations,) for the urgent repairs it has need
                                    of to enable it to go out; but the principles of neutrality,
                                    recalled in my circular of the 5th of February, do not permit us
                                    to give to one of the belligerents the means to augment its
                                    forces, and in some sort to rebuild itself: in fine, it is not
                                    proper that one of the belligerents take, without ceasing, our
                                    ports, and especially our arsenals, as a base of their
                                    operations, and, so to say, as one of their own proper
                                    ports.</p>
                                <p>You will observe to the captain of the Alabama that he has not
                                    been forced to enter into Cherbourg by any accidents of the sea,
                                    and that he could altogether as well have touched at the ports
                                    of Spain or Portugal, of England, of Belgium, and of
                                    Holland.</p>
                                <p>As to the prisoners made by the Alabama, and who have been placed
                                    ashore, they are free from the time they have touched our soil;
                                    but they ought not to be delivered up to the Kearsarge, which is
                                    a federal ship-of-war. This would be for the Kearsarge an
                                    augmentation of military force, and we can no more permit this
                                    for one of the belligerents than for the other.</p>

                            receipt of your despatch of the 3d of June, No. 480, which relates your
                            proceedings and those of the imperial government concerning the unhappy
                            difference which has arisen between Spain and Peru. Your proceedings are
                            entirely approved, and the President, with pleasure, directs that you
                            make known to Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys the satisfaction which this
                            government has derived from the ready concurrence of the Emperor in the
                            wishes we have expressed for the averting of war between two nations,
                            both of which are friendly to the United States as well as to France—a
                            war, moreover, which we cannot but think would be as unnecessary as it
                            would be injurious to the general peace of nations.</p>

                            13th of May, No. 463, inquiring whether the war steamer now being
                            constructed in New York for the Japanese government would be completed
                            in season to enable the embassy of that government to embark on their

                            sea on the 15th of August. I will thank you to ascertain the number of
                            persons attached to the embassy with a view to their proper
                            accommodation on the voyage, and also as to the date of their intended

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: By a despatch sent you by the last
                            steamer, I informed you that a fight was anticipated between the United
                            States ship Kearsarge and the Alabama, and that I had, after a
                            conference with M. Drouyn. de l’Huys, sent my son to <pb n="107"
                                xml:id="pg_107" facs="0127"/>Cherbourg with a communication for
                            Captain Winslow. He arrived there at 9½ p. m. Our vice-consul, McLain,
                            who has been at all times prompt and efficient, was at the depot
                            watching for men supposed to be coming to the Alabama from the
                            Rappahannock; none, however, came. The vice-consul applied to the
                            maritime prefect to receive my son, who, when informed that he was the
                            bearer of despatches from me for Captain Winslow, said he would give him
                            a permit to go off to the Kearsarge next morning at 7½ o’clock. The next
                            morning he did so, the ship then lying some six or seven miles off at
                            sea. He found that the prefect had himself already communicated the
                            wishes of this government as to the distance within which it wished a
                            fight should not occur. The next information I received was at about
                            half past 2 p. m. on Sunday, by telegram from my son, in these words:
                            “Cherbourg, 19th June, 1864, 1 o’clock 22′.—The Kearsarge sunk the
                            Alabama this morning, after a fight of one hour and a half. The Alabama
                            sunk five miles from the shore.” This was confirmed by a second
                            telegram, somewhat later in the day, with the additional information
                            that he had been on board the Kearsarge since the fight; that but three
                            of her seamen were wounded; no officers were injured; that there was no
                            important damage to the Kearsarge; that they had taken sixty-five
                            prisoners, but that Captain Semmes and his first lieutenant had made
                            their escape on board an English yacht. For the nationality of this
                            yacht he must have depended, I presume, upon the information derived
                            from those around him. It is by him received, therefore, with proper
                            caution. I subsequently received from him a hastily written letter,
                            dated Sunday, ¼ before 2 p. m., in which he tells me that from an
                            elevated position near Cherbourg he saw the entire fight—that it lasted
                            an hour and a half, at the end of which the Alabama tried to run away,
                            but could not escape. The Kearsarge pursued, apparently, he says. She
                            then surrendered, for the firing ceased. A few minutes after two boats
                            were seen to put off from the Kearsarge, but before they could reach the
                            Alabama she went down in a second, <hi rend="italic">apparently</hi>
                            without anything on board.</p>
                        <p>In the morning of the same day I received from Captain Winslow a telegram
                            in these words: “Alabama is sunk; had I not better parole prisoners, as
                            they incumber us for want of accommodations? Immediate answer.” To this
                            I replied: “By no means. To parole your prisoners would be to admit the
                            Alabama a regular ship-of-war. Our government has always denied this.
                            The St. Louis will be at Cherbourg in a short time and relieve you of
                            your incumbrance, if you wish it.”</p>
                        <p>I received a subsequent telegram on the same subject, and then wrote to
                            Captain Winslow a letter, of which I send you, herewith, a copy. I have
                            just learned from an eye-witness that a few of the dead and wounded from
                            the Alabama were on the Kearsarge after the fight. I do not, however,
                            suppose there was great loss of life even on board the Alabama. It is
                            reported ten were killed besides those drowned, but this comes from
                            confederate authority, and I have no great confidence in the accuracy of
                            the statement. The destruction of this vessel off the French coast has
                            excited a great sensation here, and will help to redeem our naval
                            prestige, much diminished abroad of late years. It is but just that I
                            should say that Captain Winslow has been equally prompt and efficient
                            since the arrival of the Alabama in European; waters. Immediately upon
                            being informed by our consul at Cherbourg, on June 11, that the Alabama
                            had arrived there, I telegraphed the fact to the Kearsarge, at Flushing.
                            He answered on the 12th that he would be off Cherbourg about
                            Wednesday—and he was there. He did not enter the port, (which would have
                            subjected him to the application of the twenty-four hour rule,) but laid
                            off beyond the three-miles limit—sometimes even out of sight. My son was
                            informed that Semmes had instructed his agent in Cherbourg to inform
                            Captain Winslow that the presence of the Kearsarge off Cherbourg was an
                            insult! and he intended to come out and meet him. And it is just to say
                            he did so, boldly, in broad daylight, accompanied by a <pb n="108"
                                xml:id="pg_108" facs="0128"/>French man-of-war to the distance of at
                            least three miles, to see, doubtless, that the three-mile rule was
                            respected, when she left him, and the battle soon commenced. The whole
                            affair was clearly visible to all those well placed on the shore. Many
                            boats went off towards its close, and helped to pick up the swimming and

                            were carried on shore, and some got off in an English vessel, and were
                            landed, I am informed by telegram, at Southampton. I have written you a

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Sir</hi>: Permit me to offer you, your
                                officers and crew, my hearty congratulations upon your success, this
                                morning, in destroying the Alabama— that pest of the seas. You could
                                have rendered to your country, I am sure, no service more acceptable
                                than this; every loyal American will receive a knowledge of the fact
                                with gratification and joy. I am happy in being able, as an organ of
                                my countrymen, to tender to you thus promptly their thanks and
                                congratulations. I am sure I can but express, very feebly by
                                anticipation, their thanks and good wishes.</p>
                            <p>Your telegram as to the question of paroling your prisoners was not
                                received in time to get off an answer which can be received
                                to-night, the office at Cherbourg not being open, as I am informed,
                                to receive despatches after 9 p. m. I telegraphed you, however, that
                                you had better not parole your prisoners, because our government had
                                always refused to consider the Alabama a regular ship-of-war; and to
                                discharge these prisoners on their parole would be to concede to
                                them a right which the government had, in effect, denied they were
                                entitled to. The responsibility of determining the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >status</hi> I thought most prudent should be left to the
                                government itself. The St. Louis was, two days ago, on its way to
                                Cadiz and Cherbourg, and would, if necessary, relieve your decks of
                                their incumbrances. Please report to me the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >circumstances</hi> under which Captain Semmes and lieutenant
                                escaped on the English yacht referred to in the telegram from my

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: My son returned from Cherbourg last night
                            by way of Havre, to which latter place, at the request of our
                            vice-consul at Cherbourg, he had gone with the 37 prisoners brought into
                            Cherbourg by the Alabama; these persons he left with Mr. Putnam, our
                            consul at Havre, and then returned immediately to Paris.</p>
                        <p>It may not be amiss to state some additional facts communicated to my son
                            while at Cherbourg in reference to the Alabama and Kearsarge. He was on
                            board the latter immediately after the fight, and while there he was
                            informed <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0129"/>that the Alabama had
                            formally surrendered. That an officer had come on board the Kearsarge,
                            said they had surrendered, that they were in a sinking condition, and
                            asked assistance to save the crew. That this was at once granted. Their
                            flag had been hauled down, but having no white flag at hand, they had
                            torn off the colored part and used the white remnant for this purpose.
                            That in the mean time, and after the surrender, the English yacht
                            Deerhound came near the Kearsarge, and was asked by Captain Winslow,
                            from motives of humanity, to help them pick up the crew of the Alabama.
                            That they said they would do so. They then proceeded towards the
                            Alabama, and picked up a number of the officers and crew, but instead of
                            delivering them to the Kearsarge, as under the circumstances the
                            officers of the last-named ship thought them bound in honor to do, they
                            steamed off, and made their escape with the prisoners towards the
                            English coast. Captain Winslow says he would have stopped or followed
                            them, but while he observed them bearing off, he supposed they might be
                            looking about for others yet struggling or floating in the water; that
                            he never dreamed that this vessel, belonging to a reputable yacht club,
                            could act so dishonorably, but the impression now is that the yacht was
                            present there by concert with Semmes, and with a view not only to see
                            the fight, but to aid the crew of the Alabama if occasion should arise
                            for it. As some evidence of the relationship between these parties, the
                            prisoners taken on board the Kearsarge from the Alabama say that Semmes
                            did not, before going out to fight, deposit the chronometers taken by
                            him from vessels destroyed with the Brazil consul or any other parties
                            at Cherbourg, as reported in the journals, but that he did deposit about
                            120,000 francs worth of money and jewelry. That the chronometers he had
                            collected were, about 3 a. m. of the day of the fight, put on board this
                            English yacht. The yacht preceded him to sea on the morning of the fight
                            only about half an hour, and communicated with him apparently as he came
                            out.</p>
                        <p>The damages to the Kearsarge are entirely unimportant. She is ready again
                            for service; she was touched by 28 shot in all; eight shots only struck
                            her hull, four of these lodged there; one shell lodged, and still
                            remains unexploded in her rudder port; port boat aft was struck twice,
                            one shot went through the smokestack, one through the engine-room
                            sky-light. All the rest hit in the rigging. The Alabama fired 18 shots
                            before the Kearsarge returned the fire; the vessels nearing each other
                            gradually. The Kearsarge fired in all 173 shots. The Alabama fired many
                            more, but her firing was wild, while the practice of the Kearsarge was
                            excellent.</p>
                        <p>I learn from my son that Captain Winslow not receiving any despatch as to
                            paroling his prisoners until 11 o’clock at night of the day of the
                            fight, (which was earlier than I supposed he would get it,) and being
                            inconvenienced for want of accommodations, paroled the men, who were his
                            prisoners, though not the officers, five of whom are yet with him. He
                            put the men on shore that night. Perhaps he was right and I was wrong;
                            at all events, it closes, as to the men, for the present, a question
                            which might have been troublesome.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I yesterday communicated to Mr. Dronyn de
                            l’Huys a copy of the letter from Mr. Mansfield, our consul at Tabasco,
                            dated 10th of February last, and enclosed to me in your despatch No.
                            567, and I made this the basis of further <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110"
                                facs="0130"/>complaint to him on the subject of Mr. Mansfield’s
                            imprisonment. Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys said he had never been able to obtain
                            any knowledge on the subject from Mexico, or the minister of marine. It
                            would seem as if they there knew nothing, not even the existence of any
                            such person as Mr. Mansfield. I told him that the complaint had been
                            made long since, and it seemed to me if he had received nothing
                            conflicting with the statements of Mr. Mansfield, it was but just and
                            fair they should assume them as true, and act on them accordingly; that
                            they could scarcely suppose, after this ill treatment of our consul,
                            that we would be satisfied by the authorities simply ignoring the whole
                            subject. He said that, with this additional communication now left with
                            him, he would make one more effort for information and give me an
                            answer.</p>

                            Amsterdam, and our consul thinks will go there. You will recollect I
                            told them I would prefer that she should be delivered in Amsterdam
                            rather than off Bordeaux, if permitted to go out of port at all. It will
                            now be seen if Holland will permit her to be armed there, or will, in
                            any respect, aid and abet this fraud (if it be such) against us.</p>
                        <p>The Osacca, a twin ship, and sold, as I am informed, to the same parties,
                            will not be ready to leave for perhaps a week or two more. They are
                            pressing her to completion as fast as possible, a large number of hands
                            being constantly engaged. She will of course be permitted, like the
                            Yeddo, to leave port. Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys professes to be convinced, as
                            I have heretofore informed you, that the sale is a fair one, and that
                            these vessels will not get into the hands of the confederates; but I am
                            not at all satisfied, though I have nothing except circumstances and my
                            utter distrust of the good faith of Arman on which to rest my
                            suspicions. You will find an account of her sailing in Galignani, of
                            this morning. In renewing my remonstrances to Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys
                            yesterday on this subject, he said they could do no more than they had
                            done; they had exercised a proper caution and prudence to see that the
                            sale was to a neutral and <hi rend="italic">bona fide;</hi> that the
                            builder had a right to sell his ship, and they could not stop him
                            without being subject to damages. I told him it was certainly better to
                            take this hazard than the hazard of war between the two countries. He
                            answered that they were subject to laws as well as we, and that they,
                            like us, must respect the rights of their citizens; that,
                            notwithstanding all the “reproaches” against France, nothing had
                            happened, up to the sailing of the Yeddo at least, against which we
                            could in any way complain. I made no reply to, or rather disclaimer of,
                            this word “reproaches,” though I certainly have used no language which
                            could be justly so termed; but I have used frequent and strong
                            remonstrances in reference to the completion and sailing of these ships,
                            which was, doubtless, about what M. Drouyn de l’Huys meant. I certainly
                            ought not, and indeed cannot, go further on this subject than I have
                            done. I hope that my suspicions will all turn out to be groundless, but
                            I wish the Niagara and Dictator were here. Some increased force on this
                            coast, and in these waters, may be necessary at an early day. Its
                            presence, at all events, will be useful.</p>
                        <p>The whole government press of France sympathizes with the Alabama. You
                            would suppose from its descriptions that that vessel had gone out to
                            fight only <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0131"/>from a high sense of
                            honor, though conscious that she was every way overmatched in size,
                            armament, and crew; that, in fact, she was a mere martyr to a chivalrous
                            sense of honor. I enclose you a printed statement of what purports to be
                            an official report of the combat, from Captain Semmes. To whom this
                            report is made, or how it happens to be published immediately here, does

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that,
                                in accordance with my intention as previously announced to you, I
                                steamed out of the harbor of Cherbourg between nine and ten o’clock
                                on the morning of June 19, for the purpose of engaging the enemy’s
                                steamer Kearsarge, which had been lying off and on the port for
                                several days previously. After clearing the harbor we descried the
                                enemy with his head off shore, at a distance of about nine miles. We
                                were three-quarters of an hour in coming up with him. I had
                                previously pivoted my guns to starboard, and made all my
                                preparations for engaging the enemy on that side. When within about
                                a mile and a quarter of the enemy he suddenly wheeled, and bringing
                                his head in-shore, presented his starboard battery to me. By this
                                time we were distant about one mile from each other, when I opened
                                on him with solid shot, to which he replied in a few minutes, and
                                the engagement became active on both sides. The enemy now pressed
                                his ship under a full head of steam, and to prevent our passing eaeh
                                other too speedily, and to keep our respective broadsides bearing,
                                it became necessary to fight in a circle; the two ships steaming
                                around a common centre, and preserving a distance from each other of
                                from a quarter to half a mile. When we got within good shellrange we
                                opened upon him with shell. Some ten or fifteen minutes after the
                                commencement of the action our spanker gaff was shot away, and our
                                ensign came down by the run. This was immediately replaced by
                                another at the mizzenmast head. The firing now became very hot, and
                                the enemy’s shot and shell soon began to tell upon our hull,
                                knocking down, killing and disabling a number of men in different
                                parts of the ship. Perceiving that our shell, though apparently
                                exploding against the enemy’s sides, were doing but little damage, I
                                returned to solid-shot firing, and from this time onward alternated
                                with shot and shell. After the lapse of about one hour and ten
                                minutes our ship was ascertained to be in a sinking condition, the
                                enemy’s shell having exploded in our sides and between decks,
                                opening large apertures, through which the water rushed with great
                                rapidity. For some few minutes I had hopes of being able to reach
                                the French coast, for which purpose I gave the ship all steam, and
                                set such of the fore and aft sails as were available. The ship
                                filled so rapidly, however, that before we had made much progress
                                the fires were extinguished in the furnaces, and we were evidently
                                on the point of sinking. I now hauled down my colors to prevent the
                                further destruction of life, and despatched a boat to inform the
                                enemy of our condition. Although we were now but four hundred yards
                                from eaeh other, the enemy fired upon me five times after my colors
                                had been struck, dangerously wounding several of my men. It is
                                charitable to suppose that a ship-of-war of a Christian nation could
                                not have done this intentionally. We now turned all our exertions
                                towards the wounded, and such of the <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112"
                                    facs="0132"/>boys of the ship as were unable to swim. These were
                                despatched in my quarter boats, the only boats remaining to me, the
                                waist boats having been torn to pieces.</p>
                            <p>Some twenty minutes after my furnace fires had been extinguished, and
                                the ship being on the point of settling, every man, in obedience to
                                a previous order which had been given to the crew, jumped overboard
                                and endeavored to save himself. There was no appearance of any boat
                                coming to me from the enemy until after the ship went down.
                                Fortunately, however, the steam yacht Deer-hound, owned by a
                                gentleman of Lancashire, England, Mr. John Lancaster, who was
                                himself on board, steamed up in the midst of my drowning men and
                                rescued a number of both officers and men from the water. I was
                                fortunate enough myself thus to escape to the shelter of the neutral
                                flag, together with about forty others, all told. About this time
                                the Kearsarge sent one, and then, tardily, another boat.</p>
                            <p>Accompanying you will find lists of the killed and wounded, and of
                                those who were picked up by the Deerhound. The remainder, there is
                                reason to hope, were picked up by the enemy, and by a couple of
                                French pilot-boats which were also fortunately near the scene of
                                action. At the end of the engagement it was discovered, by those of
                                our officers who went alongside the enemy’s ship with the wounded,
                                that her midship section on both sides was thoroughly iron-coated,
                                this having been done with chains constructed for the purpose,
                                placed perpendicularly from the rail to the water’s edge; the whole
                                covered over by a thin outer planking which gave no indication of
                                the armor beneath. This planking had been ripped off in every
                                direction by our shot and shell, the chain broken and indented in
                                many places, and forced partly into the ship’s side. She was most
                                effectually guarded, however, in this section from penetration. The
                                enemy was much damaged in other parts, but to what extent it is now
                                impossible to tell; it is believed he was badly crippled.</p>
                            <p>My officers and men behaved steadily and gallantly, and though they
                                have lost their ship, they have not lost honor. Where all behaved so
                                well it would be invidious to particularize; but I cannot deny
                                myself the pleasure of saying that Mr. Kell, my first lieutenant,
                                deserves great credit for the fine condition in which the ship went
                                into action, with regard to her battery, magazine, and shell-rooms;
                                also that he rendered me great assistance by his coolness and
                                judgment as the fight proceeded.</p>
                            <p>The enemy was heavier than myself both in ship, battery, and crew,
                                but I did not know until the action was over that she was also
                                iron-clad. Our total loss in killed and wounded is thirty, to wit,
                                nine killed and twenty-one wounded.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            the new transatlantic steamship line from Havre to New York, inaugurated
                            by a banquet at Havre on Wednesday, the 15th of this month; on which day
                            the steamer Washington, the first and only finished ship of the line,
                            left for New York. The line is to consist of five large steamships, well
                            built and well furnished. It is on this side in the hands of Mr.
                            Pereire, president of the company, and who is likewise president of the

                                n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0133"/>the French government, and if
                            properly managed, cannot fail to be a successful enterprise. I was
                            present at the inauguration by invitation of the company, and made a few
                            remarks expressive of our good wishes. Some speeches were made by French
                            gentlemen present, especially one by M. Michel Chevalier, (a gentleman,
                            as you know, of literary celebrity, and a senator of France,) highly
                            eulogistic of our country. Everything passed off pleasantly. The steamer
                            will have arrived at New York doubtless before this letter will have
                            reached your department. I hope such notice will be taken of her and of
                            her officers in that port as may gratify the national pride of France.
                            No people are more sensitive than they to attentions of any kind. A new
                            line of steamships between Havre and New York is an event of great
                            importance, not to our commercial interests only, but as an additional
                            link uniting in relations of peace and friendship the two nations more
                            firmly together.</p>

                            <p>P. S.—Captain Winslow has come up to Paris; the Kearsarge is yet at
                                Cherbourg, ready for sea.</p>
                            <p>I have received a telegram from Flushing advising me of the arrival
                                of the Niagara at Antwerp. I am glad she is there. There is little
                                doubt an effort is being made to furnish Captain Semmes with another
                                ship. I enclose you a slip cut from <hi rend="italic">La France</hi>
                                of this morning, which purports to give some details. It would seem
                                that it is taken for granted that the men paroled will pay no
                                attention to their parole. I had heard this before, but could not
                                credit it.</p>

                            <head>The Alabama.</head>
                            <p>They write us from Cherbourg that the greater part of the seamen of
                                the Alabama have left that city after having received one month’s
                                pay and their travelling expenses. They have received the orders of
                                their captain, and have kept secret the name of the port at which
                                they are to meet again.</p>
                            <p>Captain Semmes has not left England. He has called near him those of
                                his officers to whom he has intrusted the armament of the new vessel
                                of which he will soon take the command. According to the information
                                which we have been enabled to obtain, the new Alabama will be a
                                small, sharp-built corvette, with covered blinds within, and
                                provided with a powerful battery. Captain Semmes has, it is said,
                                ordered to be privately made three pivot guns capable of throwing
                                hollow projectiles of 170 pounds English, and solid shot of 220
                                pounds. His crew, which consisted of 142 men, will be increased to
                                172 men. This information is positive. We are entirely ignorant of
                                the port where the vessel is to be fitted out, but it is probable
                                that no degree of watchfulness will prevent her from taking the
                                sea.</p>
                            <p>The confederates have no large squadrons like their adversaries, and,
                                in order to injure them effectually, they have armed, as privateers,
                                a portion of their war vessels, which are manned by picked officers
                                and crews. The Alabama was so equipped. That vessel was entered on
                                the register of the southern navy as No. 87; the Florida, so known,
                                was get down as No. 83. She is commanded by a captain of a frigate.
                                The war of these privateers is terrible to the commerce of the
                                north, to which it causes enormous losses. In the actual state of
                                    <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0134"/>things, this warfare is
                                completely lawful. It is the same warfare which France waged with so
                                much success against England under the Empire, and we know the high
                                estimation in which Napoleon the First held the celebrated Surcouf,
                                upon whom he bestowed the cross of the legion of honor. This
                                estimation the present Emperor has continued to hold for his memory,
                                and he has desired that his name should be given to one of the
                                vessels of the imperial navy. One of our most efficient corvettes is
                                called the Surcouf, and also two of our ships-of-the-line are called
                                the Jean-Bart and the Duguay-Trouyn. These facts must be known.</p>
                            <p>Semmes, the commander of the Alabama, has been accused of having
                                caused his prisoners to be put in irons. This accusation deserves a
                                short and irrefutable explanation. The hatred which the people of
                                the north have for the people of the south, and reciprocally, is
                                known. The war which they are waging against one another causes
                                these passionate feelings to be greatly aggravated. They both treat,
                                by reciprocity, their prisoners of war with a harshness which is
                                unknown in Europe.</p>
                            <p>Captain Semmes is known for his humanity. Numerous facts prove it;
                                but on one occasion the confederate corvette, Jefferson Davis,
                                fitted out as a privateer, was captured by a northern frigate. The
                                commander of the privateer and ten of her crew, who drew lots
                                therefor, were put in irons. The government of Richmond being
                                officially informed of this fact, ordered its officers to act in
                                like manner for the period of six months. It is proven that Semmes
                                only so acted in compliance with higher orders issued in consequence
                                of a reciprocity.</p>
                            <p>Our information from Cherbourg makes known to us that the Kearsarge
                                was still at that port, and that her repairs will not be completed
                                before the middle of July. It has been found necessary, in order to
                                have a duplicate thereof in case of an accident, to have made, by
                                private parties, one of the principal parts of her machinery.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In your despatch of the 8th of June, No.
                            484, which has already been acknowledged, you remark that you thought M.
                            Drouyn de l’Huys was rather disposed to find fault with late proceedings
                            of this government; that he referred again to our refusal of coal to the
                            French fleet and to our giving up “to be hanged,” as he said, the
                            secretary of Vidaurri, who had fled to Brownsville for protection,
                            although there now was scarcely a man against France in Mexico. You
                            state that M. Drouyn de l’Huys further remarked that after their
                            military officers were on the ocean to visit our country with a view to
                            examine what was to be seen there with our assent and assurance of
                            welcome, they were then informed that this line or that could not be
                            examined, and that it would have been agreeable if notice had been
                            sooner given. (The remark to which this is in allusion is omitted in Mr.
                            Dayton’s note, as printed.) In your despatch No. 483 you intimate an
                            apprehension that the French government may not be unwilling to find us
                            acting so as to enable it to assume that it is put on the defensive, and
                            entitled to vindicate its honor.</p>
                        <p>The remarks of M. Drouyn de l’Huys, although not intrinsically grave,
                            derive importance from the peculiar position of the relations between
                            France and the United States. The executive government of this country
                            has no such susceptibilities as to make it desire or favor any
                            misunderstanding with the government of France. On the contrary, it is
                            an administration which, by its very constitution, would be pacific and
                            friendly towards France, and towards all nations, even if it did not
                            find especial and urgent persuasions to that policy in the distractions
                            of our unhappy civil war. Nevertheless it is not well to overlook the
                            fact that a large mass of the American people, owing to the war of
                            France against Mexico, are not less open to alienating influences in
                            regard to France than the government of France can be in regard to the
                            United States. It will be well, therefore, for you to let M. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys understand that you communicated his complaints to me, and to
                            give him my answer to them, which is as follows:</p>
                        <p>First. In relation to the supply of coals for the French fleet: the same
                            practice was followed in regard to France in that case which is followed
                            in regard to all other nations. Second. The restrictions on the supply
                            of coals to foreign vessels were adopted for our own safety against a
                            dangerous internal enemy, and for the guarding of our neutrality, as
                            much in regard to Mexico as in regard to France. Third. That the
                            difficulty about the exportation of the coals in question was
                            accommodated to the satisfaction of the French government. Fourth. In
                            regard to the delivery of the secretary of Vidaurri to the authorities
                            of Mexico: the French government has not complained of that transaction,
                            nor has this government been officially called upon to express itself
                            concerning the affair. The proceeding was a military one; it occurred on
                            a distant and disturbed frontier, without any knowledge on the part of
                            the Executive, and, so far as this government has subsequently received
                            any knowledge or information, the offending Mexican who was delivered up
                            to his own government was an open enemy of the United States, and the
                            general who delivered him up had no knowledge or reason to believe that
                            the Mexican authorities would deal with him other than as a prisoner of
                            war. Fifthly. As to the delay of the French officers on their way to the
                            army of the Potomac after this government had assented to their visit:
                            the assent was given with no reservation, because no occasion for any
                            was anticipated. A military exigency of extreme delicacy and importance
                            subsequently occurred, and the commanding general of the armies of the
                            United States deemed it important to exclude, for the time, all visitors
                            from the army. <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0136"/>Notice was given
                            to the French as well as to the British commission at the first moment
                            when this necessity was announced to this government. The French
                            commission was received here with all the hospitalities of the
                            government, and as soon as the exigency referred to had passed, they
                            were sent forward to the field of observation. You may make these
                            explanations to M. Drouyn de l’Huys. You may say to him that this
                            government cannot admit that in either of the transactions I have thus
                            reviewed, it has been either unjust, discourteous, or unfriendly to the
                            government of France. This government avoids with equal care the putting
                            unfriendly constructions upon the proceedings of the government of
                            France and on other foreign states, and the giving of accidental offence
                            on our own part to all foreign nations.</p>
                        <p>Pursuing this course, we calmly abide events which must determine
                            whether, in spite of our devotion to peace, the field of war on this
                            continent must be enlarged.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatches as follows of the 8th of June, Nos. 483 and
                            484, and of the 10th of June, No. 485, all of which relate to the
                            “Rappahannock,” and to the ships which are building at Bordeaux and at
                            Nantes for the insurgents.</p>
                        <p>After a careful reading of these papers, I am authorized by the President
                            to approve of all that you have said and written to M. Drouyn de l’Huys
                            concerning those vessels.</p>
                        <p>I agree with you, that what Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys has now said and written
                            on that subject is less decisive in regard to the prevention of the
                            vessels from going into the hands of the insurgents than his former
                            verbal assurances, and less emphatic than this government has a right to
                            expect. It is proper for me to remark, however, that Mr. Geofroy seems
                            to understand the purposes of his government in respect to the vessels,
                            and he has certainly given me expressions just as decisive as the
                            earlier verbal assurances of M. Drouyn de l’Huys, which were accepted by
                            yourself and by this government. Under the circumstances, we indulge a
                            hope that before this time you will have received from him a full and
                            distinct guarantee in reply to your note of the 7th of June, a copy of
                            which is appended to your No. 484. I can conceive that the proceedings
                            of the French government might be legal, so far as we are concerned, and
                            yet that it might desire to practice reserve in regard to the future
                            destination of the vessels. In any case, it is not easy to see that you
                            can do more than to persevere in the course of proceedings which you
                            have hitherto pursued.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Geofroy has to-day submitted to me a
                            despatch which has been received from M. Drouyn de l’Huys, in which he
                            states the fact of the sale of two ships, the Yeddo and the Osacca,
                            which Arman built for the insurgents, to alleged neutrals, to be
                            delivered in Holland, substantially on the same terms as those which M.
                            Drouyn de l’Huys made in communicating that transaction to yourself, as
                            you have related them to us in your despatches. In the absence of full
                            and definite information about the names, condition, or character of the
                            alleged purchaser, the terms of his contract or the other circumstances
                            of the alleged sale, this government is not prepared to pronounce its
                            acquiescence in the disposition of the subject which has been made by
                            the French government. We are to be understood, therefore, as
                            maintaining in regard to France all the protests we have heretofore made
                            concerning those vessels, and reserving all the rights and remedies in
                            respect to the vessels themselves which belong to the United States
                            under the law of nations. At the same time we willingly believe that the
                            French government has taken proper care to guard against the vessels
                            being used for making war upon the United States.</p>

                                of the three men of the Kearsarge, who were confided to my care, and
                                whom you saw during your visit at Cherbourg. The one whose thigh and
                                leg were seriously injured is in as satisfactory a state as
                                possible, and I hope to be able to avoid an amputation, the result
                                of which, as it would have to be made very high up, would be very
                                uncertain. The sergeant whose arm was amputated is not doing badly;
                                the last (the third) will certainly recover.</p>
                            <p>Be pleased to communicate this information to M. your father, and say
                                to him that everything which solicitude and most lively sympathies
                                can impose in the way of care will be given to the wounded which the
                                fight has brought us. Be <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0138"

                            <p>In the Magrato country of Japan was committed the unlawful act of
                                firing cannon into an American ship, which caused great regret on
                                account of the amicable relations of the two countries.</p>
                            <p>By the express order of his majesty the Taicoon of Japan to apologize
                                for this act, and to enter into negotiations as to the steps to be
                                taken in order to quiet the revolutionary sentiment of the Japanese
                                people, we left Japan in our twelfth month of the last year (in
                                Europe, February, 1864) with the view of obtaining, upon arriving in
                                the capital of the United States of America, an audience of his
                                excellency the President, and of having an interview with the
                                minister of foreign affairs, and now we are here at Paris, capital
                                of France.</p>
                            <p>We have now an important matter to set before our government, and we
                                are obliged to return from here to Japan, but, in conformity to the
                                order which will be given later by our government, it is possible
                                that we will return to Europe, and that we will reach your country.
                                It is desirable that you should understand this, whilst we will
                                communicate the details in writing to the minister of foreign

                            came in contact.</p>
                        <p>I was yesterday telegraphed by Mr. Pike from the Hague, “Prussian
                            corvette Yeddo is reported arrived in the Weiser.”</p>
                        <p>The newspapers have recently been alleging a sale of these vessels at
                            Bordeaux to Prussia. It may be so.</p>

                            <p>Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
                                this date, enclosing a copy of a despatch from Mr. Dayton, United
                                States minister at Paris, on the subject of the insurgent steamer
                                Alabama, and desiring to be informed whether it is the intention of
                                the Navy Department to order to Europe the additional naval force to
                                which Mr. Dayton refers.</p>
                            <p>In reply, I would state that the United States steamer Niagara,
                                Commodore T. T. Craven, sailed from New York early in June for
                                Antwerp, and orders have to-day been issued for the United States
                                steamer Iroquois, Commander C. R. P. Rodgers, to proceed immediately
                                to Brest.</p>
                            <p>In advising you of the movements of these steamers, I must be
                                permitted to state, with due deference to the opinions of others,
                                that I cannot see of what advantage their presence in European
                                waters will be. They will be denied access, except at stated
                                periods, to European ports; they can commit no hostile act in them,
                                nor are they allowed to blockade them. Thus they will be of but
                                little service in arresting the course of the rebel privateers;
                                which have every advantage in their favor. Even were it advisable to
                                attempt a blockade of any of the ports, a large force would be
                                required. From actual experience on our own coast we know the
                                difficulty of maintaining a blockade—fifteen or twenty vessels being
                                required in some instances to make it effective. If I mistake not,
                                Mr. Adams, our minister at London, has frequently intimated that the
                                presence of our men-of-war in European waters was only a cause of
                                irritation, and of but little practical benefit.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>

                            Mr. Carvallo, the minister of Chili at Brussels, if it shall be
                            pretended that the rams now being built at <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122"

                            and shall not fail to ac upon it, if it become necessary. But Chili has
                            a minister here, Mr. Rosales, who is my immediate neighbor, and with
                            whom my relations are very good. He was at one time, on the part of
                            Chili, making all necessary inquiries about these vessels, and, if I
                            remember rightly, got the contracts under which they were built, or
                            copies of them, from me. I will have no difficulty in learning from him
                            whatever may or may not be done here for Chili.</p>
                        <p>But Europe is so disturbed just now that this class of vessels, and
                            vessels-of-war indeed of any kind, may find purchasers. The newspapers
                            assume it as a fact settled, that the two clipper ships which have left,
                            or are about to leave, Bordeaux for Amsterdam have been bought by
                            Prussia. This I hope may be so, but I am by no means sure of it.</p>
                        <p>In the Gironde, published at Bordeaux on the 5th instant, is the
                            communication in the accompanying slip, which I send you as containing
                            the substance of all the newspaper notices on this subject.</p>

                            <p>P. S.—Since writing the above, M. Drouyn de l’Huys has assured me
                                that the Yeddo has gone into the possession and ownership of
                                Prussia; and that this vessel carries her flag, and has a Prussian
                                crew aboard; which, by the way, he says is against his intention,
                                and in direct violation of Arman’s promise to him to deliver this
                                ship to a neutral in the port of Amsterdam. But Arman’s
                                misstatements to his own government have been so often repeated that
                                it is difficult to understand how a man of M. Drouyn de l’Huys ’s
                                sagacity could have permitted himself to be again deceived by
                                him.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Editor</hi>: I have just read in the last
                                number of your estimable journal an article concerning the steamer
                                Yeddo, which left here on the 22d of June, as it was alleged, for
                                Amsterdam. It is with astonishment that I find you so ill-informed
                                in this matter, for, since Saturday, at least, it has been no longer
                                a secret that the Yeddo had arrived at Bremershaven, after a passage
                                of three days, and that she now forms a part of the Prussian navy.
                                We read, in fact, in the Boersenhalle of Hamburg, of the 29th of
                                June, as follows: “Arrived at Bremershaven the French corvette the
                                Yeddo, Huet, commander, from Bordeaux.” And again: “The arrival of
                                the French steam corvette the Yeddo, Huet, commander, at
                                Bremershaven, is signalized to us; this vessel has displayed, since
                                her arrival in port, the Prussian colors.” All the newspapers,
                                including the Gironde, speak of two vessels-of-war bought by Prussia
                                in France, and expected shortly in one of the German ports of the
                                North Sea. These vessels were to bear the names of Augusta and
                                Victoria; one of them, therefore, has already arrived, and is of
                                course the Yeddo, which will receive the name of Augusta. The other
                                vessel, intended to be baptized Victoria, is the Osacca, not yet
                                finished at Bordeaux, but which will go to sea in a few days.</p>
                            <p>These two vessels, destined originally for the confederates of
                                America, were acquired by Prussia about two months ago. At that time
                                there were two <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0143"/>officers of
                                the Prussian navy at Bordeaux, who purchased them of Mr. Arman, the
                                builder. It seems that the building of vessels-of-war by Mr. Arman
                                has been very satisfactory to the Prussian officers, and it is
                                certain that Mr. Arman has received heavy orders from the Prussian
                                government. Assuredly the fact that Mr. Arman has for a week been at
                                Berlin will not negative this assertion.</p>
                            <p>Accept, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch, No. 585, in reference to
                            the movements of the Japanese ambassadors, and the completion in the
                            United States of the ships-of-war for Japan, was duly received. I
                            believe you are already apprised of the fact that the ambassadors have
                            unexpectedly returned to their own country, and that they will not at
                            present visit the United States. There is no necessity, therefore, to
                            ascertain their number with a view of preparing sufficient and proper
                            accommodations for them on their return, as requested in Mr. Weed’s
                            letter. M. Drouyn de l’Huys informs me that their sudden return was
                            unexpected to him, as he was informed, when they came, that after
                            visiting France they would go to England, and thence to other countries.
                            Their immediate return to Japan must have been equally unexpected to
                            their own government, for since their departure their government has
                            sent, through our consul at Kanagawa, to my care, as I am informed, <hi
                                rend="italic">for them,</hi> five boxes and one parcel, which
                            arrived at Marseilles two or three days after they left that port. I
                            have directed our consul at Marseilles to retain possession of the
                            boxes, &amp;c., until he can receive further instructions from
                            Japan.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: When thanking M. Drouyn de l’Huys, as
                            directed in your despatch, No. 584, for the conciliating counsel given
                            by this government in the difficulty between Spain and Peru, he took
                            occasion to say that he did not think Spain was disposed to press any
                            unjust claim or demand against Peru; that she asked only a disavowal of
                            one or two acts or wrongs, and she would at once abandon the Chincha
                            islands and enter into friendly negotiations again. M. Drouyn de l’Huys
                            did not clearly explain, or at least I did not clearly understand, the
                            extent and scope of those acts the disavowal of which was demanded. He
                            seemed, however, to be impressed with the idea that the controversy
                            between the two countries was susceptible of settlement without serious
                            difficulty.</p>

                            <p>The minister of foreign affairs of the Emperor has examined the
                                letter of Mr. Mansfield to Mr. Seward, which M. the minister of the
                                United States has been pleased to communicate to him. This paper has
                                enabled M. Drouyn de l’Huys to account better than he had been able
                                to do up to the present time, in the absence of all information of
                                the occurrence relative to M. the consul of the United States at
                                Tabasco. It appears from it that Mr. Mansfield, without valid
                                reasons, and simply in consequence of false imputations, has been
                                taken from his consulate, imprisoned, and maltreated; and that,
                                though at the time he was writing he had been permitted to return to
                                his consulate, still he was not permitted to go away from it, nor to
                                resume his official functions, nor to put himself in relations with
                                his fellow-countrymen.</p>
                            <p>The proceedings of which Mr. Mansfield complains have, without any
                                doubt, a most regretable character, since this agent engages his
                                word that nothing in his conduct, nor in his language, has been of a
                                nature to justify them.</p>
                            <p>M. Drouyn de l’Huys congratulates himself, however, upon learning
                                that the first information which was given to him by Mr. Dayton is
                                not confirmed; and that it is not at Vera Cruz, as was at first
                                supposed, that the American consul, after having been sent there,
                                had been shut up and condemned to one year’s imprisonment. If,
                                indeed, this had been so, it would very probably have been for the
                                French authorities to furnish the explanations which the measures
                                taken, apparently, if not by themselves, at least with their assent,
                                admit of. It appears, on the contrary, from the despatch of Mr.
                                Mansfield, that he has not quitted Tabasco, and that it is solely
                                from the authorities of this city that an account is to be asked for
                                the proceedings of which He has been the object. But these
                                authorities were Mexican; they were not constituted with the
                                concurrence of the French forces, who have not occupied Tabasco, and
                                they do not act with their support. No participation in their acts
                                could then be ascribed to these latter, who, if they have
                                momentarily shown themselves at Tabasco, (of which the government of
                                the Emperor is as yet ignorant,) have never established themselves
                                there, and have never been able to intervene in any manner whatever
                                in the events of this locality. Hence it does not appertain to the
                                government of the Emperor to judge of the facts which have taken
                                place there; much less can it be responsible for acts emanating from
                                an authority, more or less regular, over which it has exercised no
                                control. It can only deplore the <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125"
                                    facs="0145"/>acts of violence with which the accused Mexicans
                                are reproached, and it is not to be wondered at; moreover, that at a
                                point where internal struggles still continue, one of these
                                illegalities should occur—one of these violations of international
                                law of which Mexico has so sadly multiplied examples for a number of
                                years past. This is the fruit of the anarchy to which this country
                                has so long been a prey, and a reason for every one to wish the
                                establishment and consolidation of a more moral and a stronger
                                government.</p>
                            <p>There is reason to think, moreover, that the position of Mr.
                                Mansfield must have changed a short time after the period at which
                                he wrote, for the Mexican chiefs who at that date, that is to say,
                                in the month of February last, occupied Tabasco, were no longer
                                there in the month of May, having evacuated the place. Whatever the
                                case may be, and although the French consul at Vera Cruz has
                                evidently not been able, up to the present time, to transmit the
                                information upon this affair which had been asked of him, the
                                minister of the Emperor, at Mexico, will be written to again
                                concerning it, as he will be requested to proceed as far as shall
                                lie in his power to an inquiry into this regretable occurrence.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch of the 20th of June, No. 492.</p>
                        <p>I thank you sincerely for the very interesting and detailed account which
                            you have given me of the engagement between the Kearsarge and the
                            Alabama, which ended in the destruction of that troublesome piratical
                            vessel.</p>
                        <p>I approve of all that you have done in relation to that affair, and
                            especially of your instructions to Captain Winslow in regard to the
                            captured crew of the Alabama. This government regards with eminent
                            satisfaction the heroism and skill which were exhibited by Captain
                            Winslow, and the officers and men under his command, and the whole
                            country awards to them tributes of praise and gratitude.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless we hear, with deep regret, that Captain Winslow, without
                            waiting for your reply to his inquiries on the subject, paroled and
                            released most of the prisoners which fell into his hands. The
                            President’s disapproval of that important proceeding will be made known
                            to the captain through the Navy Department. It will be your duty to
                            inform M. Drouyn de l’Huys of that disapproval in order to prevent
                            injurious inferences which otherwise might be drawn from the
                            transaction. You will at the same time inform M. Drouyn de l’Huys that
                            this government does not regard the Alabama, nor any other vessel
                            wearing the same character, as belonging to a recognized or lawful
                            belligerent.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of the 24th of June, No.
                            495, has been received. It gives me information that the Yedo sailed on
                            the 23d of June, under the French flag for Amsterdam. Although I confide
                            in M. Drouyn de l’Huys’s assurances of the good faith of the French
                            government in regard to the sale and departure of that vessel, I shall
                            nevertheless feel much solicitude until I hear of her arrival at her
                            alleged destination. I trust that, before any new surprise can be
                            encountered in Europe, the Niagara and the Iroquois will be in European
                            waters, and I cannot doubt that their crews, together with the
                            Kearsarge, will be sufficient to protect our interest in that region. I
                            thank you for the information you have given me concerning the tone of
                            the government press of France in regard to the naval engagement which
                            resulted in the destruction of the Alabama. It is unpleasant to have
                            such a demonstration that those who desire to enjoy the imperial
                            confidence think it not inexpedient to manifest an unfriendly spirit
                            towards our country. We shall, however, be none the less wise, and
                            therefore none the less safe, because we know who in European society
                            are to be regarded as our friends.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In answer to your question contained in
                            despatch No. 594, as to whether it is advisable to send another
                            ship-of-war into European waters, I would say, that it should be
                            determined by the condition of things, or, in other words, the military
                            wants at home.</p>
                        <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0147"/>
                        <p>While a heavy ship-of-war, furnished with the new armaments and
                            improvements with which our ships are now generally constructed, is
                            never without use in European waters, adding as it does to our prestige,
                            and opening the eyes of foreigners to the maritime strength of our
                            country, yet I am bound to say that I do not see any necessity, at the
                            present moment, for an increase of force in European waters. Our force
                            is already much beyond what it has been at any time heretofore, since my
                            arrival in Europe, while the force of the confederates, so far as I
                            know, is less. We have now the Niagara cruising in the channel, the
                            Sacramento at the port of Cherbourg, and the Kearsarge now off Dover.
                            The confederate force, so far as we have <hi rend="italic">reliable</hi>
                            information, is nothing. The destruction of the Alabama has much changed
                            the condition of things here. The Rappahannock is yet detained in the
                            port of Calais. She has been seized, and if information from our
                            consular agent at the port of Boulogne be reliable, the vessel is about
                            to be sold, under some judicial proceedings, for certain debts or
                            expenses of the captain.</p>
                        <p>It is said that a new confederate vessel (the Robert Lee) is expected in
                            European waters at an early day, but of this vessel I have no knowledge
                            whatever. I can add nothing of importance to what has been said
                            heretofore, in respect to these remaining corvettes in the course of
                            construction at Bordeaux and Nantes. As the Yeddo has in good faith (so
                            far, at least, as we are concerned) gone to a neutral power, (Prussia,)
                            we may have a reasonable hope, at least, that the Osacea will follow in
                            due time. But I do not mean to depreciate at all the general importance
                            of having a naval force in these waters as weighing upon the question of
                            a disposition or otherwise to interfere in our affairs. The Dictator,
                            for instance, might exercise a most useful <hi rend="italic"
                                >influence,</hi> without there being occasion for military force
                            here.</p>
                        <p>I would add here that, in a conversation had yesterday with your secret
                            agent, he informed me that all the confederate naval officers had been
                            ordered home, and that nine of them left for Halifax by the Cunard line
                            last week, and others are to follow by instalments. Some of those
                            leaving last week, he says, carried despatches. He adds that from one
                            hundred to one hundred and fifty of them have been scattered through
                            England and France. He tells me that they now admit that they have been
                            foiled in all their purposes in respect to getting vessels out of
                            France. Of the value or reliability of this information you can judge
                            quite as well as I.</p>
                        <p>He informs me, further, that some of the officers from the Rappahannock
                            went down to Cherbourg, prior to the fight between the Alabama and
                            Kearsarge, with a view to take part with the Alabama, but the French
                            authorities would not permit them to go on board. Of this I have no
                            doubt.</p>
                        <p>Your telegram to me in <hi rend="italic">cipher</hi> was duly received,
                            and after a great search the office copy of the cipher was found, or at
                            least enough of it to enable me to read your telegram, and send it, as
                            you request, to Mr. Pike.</p>
                        <p>The last despatch in <hi rend="italic">cipher</hi> from this office,
                            which I found, is in the days of Mr. Crawford, about fifty years ago.
                            Despatches in cipher from your department, may, perhaps, be found among
                            the records of a later date, though I have seen none.</p>

                            <p>A letter from Calais states that the confederate vessel the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Rappahannock,</hi> at present in that port, lately
                                had a judgment pronounced against her by the Chamber of Commerce of
                                Boulogne, for commercial debts of the captain. It appears that when
                                the huissier, charged to affix the notice of sale, made his
                                appearance on board the vessel, the captain warned him off without
                                delay, as no such errand should be performed there. The huissier had
                                nothing else to do but to retire, and draw up a proces-verbal of the
                                circumstance.</p>
                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Vigre de Cherbourg</hi> announces that the

                                orders to be in the channel by the 15th instant.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch, No. 592, refers to a prior
                            despatch of mine, No. 486, in which I state that a private communication
                            had reached me, stating that a new but entirely unofficial effort was to
                            be made by England and France to bring our war to a close. I know of
                            nothing which could specially lead to such a belief; but the party who
                            made the statement I know to be in constant communication with the
                            government here, and even with M. Drouyn de l’Huys, and he gave me the
                            statement, not as a rumor, but as a fact entirely reliable. He said at
                            the same time that should I speak to M. Drouyn de l’Huys on the subject,
                            he would deny all knowledge of it; as well he might, having no official
                            knowledge of it, and no official action being in the first place
                            contemplated.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I send you two slips, one cut from
                            Galignani of this morning, and the other from La France, merely to
                            illustrate the mode in which the secessionists and their sympathizing
                            friends try to keep up the idea in the European mind that they yet have
                            the means and are ready to meet the United States even on the sea. The
                            result of the fight between the Kearsarge and the Alabama was a hard
                            blow, not to secession alone, but to the pride and vanity of Englishmen,
                            and especially to English ship-builders. In every mode possible they
                            seek to break their fall. It is scarcely necessary to say that the
                            Florida and Kearsarge have not met, and that the above slip which makes
                            the statement is entirely false. My son has received a letter from one
                            of the officers of the Kearsarge, dated the 14th instant, the day after
                            the pretended fight. The ship was then, and I presume is now, at
                            Dover.</p>
                        <p>I have no knowledge, as I have heretofore written you, of the Robert Lee,
                            referred to in the other slip, and am equally ignorant of any
                            confederate corvette passing through the straits of Gibraltar. If I had
                            known such vessels to exist I should have written to you otherwise than
                            I did in despatch No. 508.</p>
                        <p>In that event additional force might be needed in European waters. The
                            old sailing ship St. Louis, which, with a large crew, has been drifting
                            so long about the Mediterranean, would be in an unsafe condition if a
                            modern built confederate steamship, heavily armed, should get into those
                            waters. By the way, it would seem to me that a steamship might be
                            advantageously substituted for that vessel. A steamer with an armament
                            of modern description, and <hi rend="italic">half the crew</hi> of the
                            St. Louis, would be much more serviceable, and if a good sailer, I
                            suppose less expensive. The other half of the crew could be, I should
                            think, much more useful on vessels at home; at least, such is the
                            opinion of some officers with whom I have consulted.</p>

                                and the confederate steamer Florida. The Kearsarge, being much
                                injured, was obliged to take refuge in a neighboring port. The
                                Florida remains outside, ready to renew the engagement.”</p>

                            <p>The France says: “The federal corvette Sacramento left Cherbourg
                                yesterday morning, and steered to the westward. She has, it is said,
                                arranged to meet the Niagara, a frigate of the game nation. On the
                                other hand, the General Lee, <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0150"
                                />a confederate frigate, left the Azores a few days since, after
                                having taken in water and provisions. A confederate corvette has
                                also passed through the straits of Gibraltar. A report is current
                                that a challenge has been exchanged between the officers of the
                                northern and southern vessels to regulate the conditions of afresh
                                combat to take place in about ten days, and in which a frigate and a
                                corvette of each nation is to be engaged. The fight is proposed to
                                come off nine or ten miles from Cherbourg.”</p>
                            <p>The Lafayette, the second steamer of the Transatlantic Company, has
                                just arrived at Havre from Greenock, where she had been constructed.
                                She is in every point similar to the Washington, the other vessel of
                                the same company, and will start on her first passage to New York on
                                the 24th August.</p>

                            been received. Your proceedings in relation to the new French steamship
                            line are cordially approved. I am not aware that the vessel of that line
                            just despatched from Havre has arrived at New York. Measures will be
                            adopted to have your suggestions about her reception carried out in the
                            commercial metropolis, and her officers will receive a courteous welcome
                            if they come to this capital.</p>
                        <p>I am not inattentive to the indication of a hostile disposition indulged
                            by the government party in France against the United States. It is,
                            however, as wise as it is honorable to our national character to treat
                            France frankly and courteously in all our intercourse. Nor do I now
                            apprehend any serious complications of our relations with that
                            government or with the government of Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>European questions have become too critical to allow active hostilities
                            against us at present. Our civil war has had the effect of developing
                            political and martial forces here which are sufficient to arrest the
                            attention of statesmen, however unwillingly, in foreign countries. We
                            may not unreasonably believe that we are approaching the end of
                            revolutionary war. And it is hardly less probable that France and Great
                            Britain are now not so far from the verge of that abyss as to allow them
                            to be reckless of our rights.</p>

                            in which you inform me that Captain Winslow, of the United States ship
                            Kearsarge, had arrived at Paris, with a view, as he stated, to consult
                            some distinguished oculist residing there; that he was received by the
                            Americans in that city with great attention and respect; that a dinner,
                            attended by many Americans, was given to him and two of his officers who
                            accompanied him, on the 30th ultimo, which passed off with much eclat;
                            that on the latter date you were telegraphed by Mr. Pike, from the
                            Hague, as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Prussian corvette the Yeddo is reported arrived in the Weser, and that

                            translation of a note received from M. Drouyn de l’Huys in reference to
                            the complaint by Mr. Chase, our consul at Tampico.</p>
                        <p>This note, like some others that M. Drouyn de l’Huys has written to me,
                            is unsigned, and a mere substitute for an informal verbal communication,
                            but, being in writing, is the more satisfactory as the less liable to be
                            misunderstood.</p>
                        <p>Our consul in this case may be, and doubtless is, right in his complaint
                            of rudeness on the part of French officials, but it does seem to me he
                            would have shown more judgment if he had accepted the offered withdrawal
                            of the notes complained of (which was an implied apology) rather than
                            made this rudeness the subject of a serious diplomatic
                            correspondence.</p>

                                    >July,</hi> 1864.</p>
                            <p>The minister of foreign affairs of the Emperor has examined the two
                                despatches of the American consul at Tampico, relative to the
                                threats of imprisonment to which he has been subjected, despatches
                                which M. the minister of the United States has been directed to
                                communicate to the government of his Majesty. It is not possible to
                                answer Mr. Dayton definitively upon this subject before receiving
                                the explanations requested of the commandant-in-chief of the French
                                forces in Mexico. The attentive perusal of the second despatch of
                                Mr. Chase cannot fail, however, to suggest to M. Drouyn de l’Huys
                                some reflections, which it seems to him proper to offer at once to
                                M. the minister of the United States. The circumstantial details
                                given in regard to this affair by the American consul in his last
                                report are in effect of a nature to lessen very much its
                                gravity.</p>
                            <p>According to the declaration of Mr. Chase himself, he had already in
                                his hands the two letters of the superior commandant of Tampico,
                                which now cause his demand for satisfaction when he went to this
                                officer to represent to him that he could not answer for the good
                                conduct of any one who might enter Tampico.</p>
                            <p>The commandant excused himself for having written as he had done, in
                                alleging that he had been led into it by the alarming rumors which
                                were at that time in circulation.</p>
                            <p>A short time afterwards Mr. Chase made a second visit to this same
                                officer, to present, with a view to preventing any disquieting
                                remarks, the captain of an American ship-of-war which had arrived,
                                in the mean time, at Tampico.</p>
                            <p>The incident seemed then completely void, when the French commandant
                                learnt from the manager of the imperial consulate that Mr. Chase,
                                having re-read his second note, had manifested an extreme
                                dissatisfaction with it. The commandant of Tampico hastened then to
                                send back the French agent to the American consul to offer to
                                withdraw the letters by which he felt himself wounded. Mr. Chase
                                answered to this offer by requiring written apologies, in order to
                                transmit them to his government, and the French officer refused
                                them.</p>
                            <p>These are the facts, as Mr. Chase himself states them. Now it appears
                                from this recital that the misdoings of the superior commandant of
                                Tampico would consist in having written to the American consul in
                                terms assuredly much to be regretted, but that he hastened, upon
                                learning the impression which they had made upon this consul, to
                                offer him spontaneously the withdrawal of his notes. He no doubt
                                thought that would suffice Mr. Chase, since the two visits of the
                                latter did not allow him to suspect the importance which the
                                incident might take in the eyes of this agent. It is not to be
                                admitted for an instant, as the latter gives it to be understood,
                                that it was the appearance of a federal ship which brought the
                                commandant of Tampico to the more correct proceedings, for he had,
                                before the arrival of this vessel, very courteously received the
                                observations of Mr. Chase, and, to speak the truth, it is rather
                                singular that it was only after the satisfactory explanations
                                exchanged and after a second visit to the French officer, in order
                                to present to him the federal captain, that Mr. Chase thought it
                                useful to re-read more attentively, or to cause to be more
                                faithfully translated, a note of six lines which had been the cause
                                of all his previous proceedings.</p>
                            <p>So, by the very terms of the despatches of the consul of the United
                                States, if there were for a moment a fault in the proceedings on the
                                part of the superior commandant of Tampico, this officer seems to
                                have wished, by his after conduct, to have effaced its impressions
                                upon Mr. Chase.</p>

                            from Mr. de la Montagnie, our consul at Nantes, in reference to the
                            vessels building at that port.</p>
                        <p>He seems to think that a man named Hansarson, who has been a rebel agent,
                            as supposed, at that port, has yet charge of those vessels, and the
                            inference consequently is, that the rebels yet hold their interest and
                            control in and over those two clipper ships building there. These you

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since my last communication which I
                                had the honor of addressing, July 2, I have to report: On Tuesday of
                                this week (July 12) I went to St. Nazaire, hoping to learn something
                                about the rebel ships there. If Mr. Bourcard was correct in saying
                                that Hansarson, the rebel agent, was not in command at the time,
                                such is no longer true, for he is again in control. Still the number
                                of workmen is limited, and little progress has been made since my
                                last report. I continue of the opinion that they cannot be finished
                                before the close of August.</p>
                            <p>I learned yesterday, from a respectable source, that Prussian and
                                Peruvian agents had applied to purchase these ships, but the rebel
                                agents had declined the sale.</p>
                            <p>Application was made some time ago by Prussian agents to a gentleman
                                in St. Nazaire for the purchase of the Shooting Star, an American
                                ship then in port. The price was too large and the transaction
                                failed.</p>
                            <p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            which is accompanied by a memorandum from M. Drouyn de l’Huys,
                            concerning the case of James H. Mansfield, United States consul at
                            Tabasco, has been received.</p>
                        <p>The spirit of that paper is highly honorable to the Emperor’s government.
                            I suspend a consideration of the explanations until the further
                            examination which the minister for foreign affairs has promised shall
                            result in some certainty, as to the question whether the wrongs
                            committed against Mr. Mansfield were exclusively the acts of Mexicans,
                            or were directed or participated in by the French military authorities
                            intervening in Mexico. If the former supposition shall prove correct, it
                            will be a plain duty to desist from further representation in the matter
                            to the French government, and to acknowledge the frankness with which M.
                            Drouyn de l’Huys has conducted his inquiries in the case.</p>

                            512, has been received, and its contents have been communicated to the
                            Secretary of the Navy. The weight of information which has been received
                            here favors a belief that the insurgent agents in Europe have become
                            convinced of their failure to build or buy and set up in Europe a navy
                            to break our blockade and revolutionize this government. A few weeks, if
                            not days, will verify this conclusion, if it is correct, and in the mean
                            time our forces now in European waters will, if properly displayed, save
                            us from any unlooked for naval accident there.</p>

                            say upon the subject itself, that any such proceeding would meet with a
                            prompt and decided answer from the United States. The principal of
                            foreign mediation in our affairs cannot be, in any form or under any
                            circumstances, admitted. You will make this explanation, or refrain from
                            making it, in the exercise of your own discretion. But when you find it
                            necessary to speak upon pretensions of mediation in any quarter, you
                            will be expected to speak not doubtfully in the sense in which I have

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received your despatch of the 18th
                            of July, No. 515, which gives me your views of the complaint of Mr.
                            Chase, United States consul at Tampico, concerning certain notes
                            addressed to him by a French officer on the entrance of a French
                            military force at that place. Your despatch is accompanied by a
                            memorandum concerning the case which M. Drouyn de l’Huys has committed
                            to you for the information of this government.</p>
                        <p>This memorandum is written in a candid and liberal spirit, and induces an
                            expectation that, when the minister for foreign affairs shall have
                            received the explanations which he has asked from the military
                            authorities, he will relieve the case of all its gravity, by showing us
                            that the French officer addressed his offensive notes to the consul,
                            without proper consideration of the respect due to that officer as an
                            agent of the United States, and that the rudeness of the note is
                            disapproved by his Imperial Majesty’s government. I freely admit that I
                            concur with you in the opinion that Mr. Chase might, with entire
                            propriety, have consented to the proposed withdrawal of the note of
                            which he complains; and I regret that he did not do so. You are quite at
                            liberty to communicate this opinion of mine to M. Drouyn de l’Huys. This
                            government attaches only as much importance to ceremonial questions as
                            the prevailing state of public sentiment on this class of national
                            issues requires. It has no desire to lift them to the dignity of
                            diplomatic debate.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have your despatch of the 80th of July,
                            No. 517, together with its accompaniments, namely: a note which was
                            addressed to you by our excellent consul at Nantes, Mr. de la Montagnie,
                            concerning the two clipper ships which are being built at that port.</p>
                        <p>The circumspection and vigilance which the consul practices are deemed
                            worthy of very high commendation, and the information he gives is
                            regarded as <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0156"/>meriting attention.
                            At the same time I am so much impressed with the good faith and
                            directness which have been manifested by M. Drouyn de l’Huys, that I
                            feel quite sure that he will at all times promptly answer any inquiries
                            you may find it necessary to make concerning the vessels in question. In
                            the last extremity the naval force now in European waters ought to be
                            ready to capture or destroy them, and I therefore hope that you will
                            take care that the naval commanders are kept well informed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report to you the
                            arrival of the American war steamer Iroquois at Brest on the 29th of
                            July last. Captain Rogers immediately communicated his presence in
                            French waters, and asked for counsel or instructions. I had in fact none
                            to give. He said he would leave Brest on Monday last, and I presume he
                            did so. He has gone in search, I think, of the Kearsarge, with which
                            vessel, for certain purposes, he desires to communicate.</p>
                        <p>I am much gratified to learn from your despatch, No. 601, that my conduct
                            in reference to all my late proceedings, in respect to the Alabama and
                            Kearsarge, are approved.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor and officers of the government are generally out of town, and
                            M. Drouyn de l’Huys has been so likewise.</p>
                        <p>On two of the late reception days for business at the Foreign Office, we
                            have had notice that the diplomatic corps would not be received. This
                            is, therefore, a slack season for business.</p>

                                your letter of 20th June, enclosing copy of an extract from a letter
                                received by you from Paris, giving information concerning the
                                movements of Mr. William M. Grwin.</p>
                            <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0157"/>
                            <p>There is a rumor here that Gwin is to be minister of finance under
                                the new government of Mexico, but I cannot vouch for the correctness
                                of the report. My impressions are that the Emperor of France will
                                require indemnity for the expenses of the war, and in the absence of
                                any revenue which could be applied to that purpose, he will demand
                                and receive from Maximilian certain territory which will comprise
                                the States of Sonora and Sinaloa, probably in lieu of a money
                                consideration.</p>
                            <p>Gwin has probably been sent as an emissary to shape the public mind
                                for such a state of things. In any event, the ports in the gulf of
                                California will most likely be a sort of rendezvous for plotters of
                                treason, bearing a similar relation to the Pacific coast that Nassau
                                does to the Atlantic.</p>
                            <p>The Mexican question is one that is of especial importance to the
                                people of this State, and for any information concerning it, which
                                you may think proper to communicate to me, I would feel especially
                                obliged.</p>

                            flag, a copy of which letter of complaint is hereunto attached. I
                            immediately addressed a note to the commodore then at Flushing to learn
                            his view of the question, and the reasons he would assign for this
                            conduct, to which I received a prompt answer. A copy of this answer has
                            been by me attached to a note from myself, forwarded to M. Dronyn de
                            l’Huys. A copy of this correspondence is hereunto attached.</p>

                            <p>The minister of foreign affairs of the Emperor has the honor to bring
                                the following facts to the knowledge of M. the minister of the
                                United States. The 6th of this month the federal frigate Niagara
                                arrived in view of Cherbourg. A pilot-boat, as is usual, went
                                alongside to offer her its services for entering into the harbor.
                                Although the commander of the Niagara had not, as it seems, the
                                intention to anchor at Cherbourg, the pilot was retained on the
                                frigate, and a short time afterwards was sent to take an officer on
                                board the federal corvette Sacramento, which had been in free
                                pratique for several days, and was consequently in constant
                                communication with the shore. This officer was afterwards taken back
                                by the same pilot to the frigate Niagara with the captain of the
                                Sacramento, and the American vice-consul, M. Liais. The two latter,
                                after <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0158"/>having remained some
                                time upon the frigate, re-embarked in the pilot-boat to return into
                                the harbor. At the moment when they left the Niagara, which was then
                                near the pass between Fort Chaougnae and that on the end of the
                                breakwater, that is to say, in French waters, the American
                                vice-consul was saluted with seven guns, without any salute being
                                paid either before or afterwards to the French flag.</p>
                            <p>M. the minister of the United States will recognize how much there is
                                incorrect and much to be regretted in this manner of proceeding.</p>
                            <p>In communicating with the harbor without making the entry, that is to
                                say, without having his bill of health examined, and without any
                                authorization, the commander of the Niagara, in the first place,
                                violated the sanitary regulations. After this first fault,
                                aggravated still more by this circumstance, of sending an officer on
                                board of the Sacramento, which had obtained free pratique, and was
                                thus in constant relation with the shore, the commander of the
                                Niagara has been wanting in the simplest proprieties in firing
                                cannon within range of the French forts without having previously
                                saluted the French flag. Things passed in such a manner that the
                                guardship, charged to see to the observance of the sanitary
                                regulations at Cherbourg, was able only at the last moment to remark
                                their breach, and was obliged to confine itself to sending out to
                                the boat which was bringing back the American vice-consul and the
                                captain to the Sacramento a boat commanded by an officer, to bring
                                to their notice the serious irregularity of which they had just been
                                guilty.</p>
                            <p>The repetition of similar incidents, which constitute at once an
                                offence against international usages, and a forgetfulness of the
                                regards due to the French flag and to the French authorities, would
                                risk compromising the good relations which these latter are desirous
                                of entertaining with the American officers; and the government of
                                the Emperor, if it was not assured (assuré) that they would not be
                                renewed, might be led to interdict entrance into its ports to
                                vessels which would act as the Niagara has done. The minister of
                                foreign affairs; of his Majesty hopes, consequently, that M. the
                                minister of the United States will be pleased to address to the
                                American vice-consul at Cherbourg the blame which he has incurred,
                                and to the commander of the federal navy the observations which the
                                irregularities admit of—only the more difficult to pass over in
                                silence since they have already occurred several times, although we
                                have abstained from noticing them on every occasion.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received a memorandum or “note
                                verbale,” as he calls it, from M. Drouyn de l’Huys, the French
                                minister of foreign affairs, calling my attention to the fact, that
                                on the 6th of this month the Niagara appeared off the port of
                                Cherbourg, and although you did not enter that port or intend to do
                                so, you took a pilot and afterwards sent him with an officer to the
                                Sacramento, which was regularly in harbor. That this pilot-boat
                                shortly returned on board the Niagara, bringing the captain of the
                                Sacramento and Mr. Liais, our vice-consul, who, after remaining on
                                board some time, left. Upon leaving they were saluted by the Niagara
                                with seven cannon, without any salute having been fired to the
                                French flag. He says this was done while in French waters between
                                Fort Chaougnac and the fort at the end of the breakwater. M. Drouyn
                                de l’Huys informs me that a recurrence of these incidents will risk
                                compromising the good relations they are anxious to entertain with
                                the federal officers, and the government of the Emperor, if it was
                                not sure (assuré) they would not occur again, <pb n="139"
                                    xml:id="pg_139" facs="0159"/>might be led to forbid entrance
                                into their harbors to vessels which would act as the Niagara has
                                done,</p>
                            <p>He complains that such irregularities have occurred before, &amp;c.,
                                &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>I give you thus the body of his complaint. I am satisfied that you
                                have not wilfully been wanting in any courtesy due from you as a
                                naval officer, or been guilty of any international disrespect
                                towards the French flag. But it is important that our relations with
                                France be kept on the best footing possible, and I should wish to
                                know what view you take of this complaint, and what answer you make
                                to it, before I myself see or write to the minister of foreign
                                affairs on the subject.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of your letter of yesterday’s date, and in answer to the
                                complaint of Monsieur Drouyn de l’Huys have to state that the
                                Niagara did appear off the port of Cherbourg on the 6th of this
                                month, where, discovering the United States ship Sacramento at
                                anchor inside the breakwater, I naturally desired to communicate
                                with her, and was about lowering one of our boats to send into the
                                harbor, when a French pilot came alongside and volunteered to take
                                the officer detailed for that purpose in his boat; as it appeared
                                that much time would be saved, the offer was thankfully accepted.
                                Lieut. Phœnix, the officer detailed for this duty, after remaining
                                on board the Sacramento a few minutes, returned in a small boat,
                                bringing with him the commander of the Sacramento, Captain Walke,
                                the American vice-consul, and the French pilot. When the boat left
                                his ship, conveying Captain Walke, the vice-consul, and the pilot, a
                                salute of seven guns was fired to the consul. At the moment it did
                                not seem to me that there was the least impropriety in this
                                proceeding; and, as I am sure that there was no wish or thought to
                                do aught which might be construed as a slight or breach of etiquette
                                towards a nation so universally esteemed and respected by our own
                                countrymen, I regret, most sincerely, that any inadvertent act of
                                mine should be entertained as an offence. Since reading your letter
                                and considering the matter fairly, I must confess that a breach of
                                etiquette was, under the circumstances, committed—a salute should
                                have been first fired to the French flag<hi rend="italic">;</hi> but
                                being outside of the harbor, the omission did not for a moment
                                present itself to me. I have, therefore, to beg that you will
                                present Monsieur Drouyn de l’Huys, in the strongest language
                                possible, my profound regrets for this neglect to salute his flag,
                                an act which I trust he will have the magnanimity to perceive was
                                one of inadvertency alone.</p>
                            <p>In a few days I may again pass in the vicinity of Cherbourg, and
                                shall, with great pleasure, if near enough, salute their flag.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, I beg leave to add that Captain Walke, in speaking of
                                his visit to Cherbourg, alluded with great feeling to the very civil
                                and friendly manner in which he was welcomed and received by the
                                people and officers of his Majesty the Emperor’s government.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                                receipt of your late communication marked “note verbale,”
                                complaining of the captain of the United States ship Niagara as
                                guilty of a breach of international courtesy in firing a salute to
                                the American consular agent while in the French waters of Cherbourg,
                                without, either before or afterwards, saluting the French flag, I
                                addressed to him a note of inquiry, asking to be informed how such
                                an act of apparent disrespect to the French flag could have
                                occurred. I have received his written reply, and I do not suppose
                                that I can dispose of the matter in a more satisfactory manner than
                                by sending you a copy of this reply and apology, which I herewith
                                do, adding thereto my own regrets that anything should have occurred
                                which could be construed into the slightest disrespect on the part
                                of one of our national ships towards that flag which the United
                                States, in common with the rest of the world, hold in the highest
                                honor.</p>

                            boilers of his ship, and advised him to appear off the port of Nantes

                            <p>Another iron-clad frigate, the Magnanime, has been launched at
                                Brest.</p>
                            <p>Two ships, intended for the confederate government, have for some
                                time past been in construction at Nantes. The Phare de la Loire now
                                states that the San Francisco and the Chang Hai are still in the
                                dock at St. Nazaire, where their fitting out is being completed with
                                a certain mystery. A notice, placed in a conspicuous position before
                                the building shed, forbids the entrance of strangers. Fastenings are
                                said to have been placed around the sides of the vessels in the
                                vicinity of the engines, to receive chains, and thus form an armor
                                similar to that used by the Kearsarge in its encounter with the
                                Alabama. M. Voruz is stated to have received from the minister of
                                marine the authorization to try the engines; Count de
                                Chasseloup-Laubat, however, required that only one vessel should
                                leave the harbor at a time, and that he should be informed of each
                                departure and arrival of these ships. The Phare de la Loire adds
                                that the date for the trial trips has not yet been fixed.</p>

                            order for the sale of the confederate ship Rappahannock had been made by
                            the Tribunal of Commerce of Boulogne. This was so, but on the very day
                            named for the sale an order came down, as I am informed by our consul at
                            Calais, prohibiting the sale and all other civil proceedings against
                            this ship. Since this, I am informed that the crew then on board the
                            Rappahannock has been discharged, and the most of them have gone to
                            England. That there now remain on board of her a guard or watch of about
                            five men and two officers only. The vessel is a miserable affair at
                            best.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have just returned from the Foreign
                            Office, and again find M. Drouyn de l’Huys is out of Paris. I am
                            informed that I cannot see him before next week. I am a little annoyed
                            at this, as I have a number of matters of current business, about which
                            I wished to speak with him. But there is nothing so pressing as to make
                            it very material whether they are attended to a week earlier or
                            later.</p>
                        <p>I am glad to find that Captain Rodgers, of the Iroquois, has been making
                            amends for the admitted neglect of the Niagara in the matter of salutes.
                            The captain of the Iroquois, on the morning of the Emperor’s fete, came
                            into harbor at Boulogne and saluted. Again at Havre he saluted on
                            entering the port, and, to the annoyance of the port officials, they had
                            no cannon mounted to return the salute until some hours had elapsed. But
                            the officials came immediately on board his ship to apologize for their
                            seeming neglect. I have advised him that even on occasions when the
                            right to salute was perhaps doubtful, it was best to give it. His
                            vessel, having completed her repairs, left Havre yesterday, and goes
                            from there to St. Nazaire, and thence to Bordeaux, to see our consuls at
                            those ports, and look after the confederate ships being built there. You
                            will recollect that it is not known that the iron-clads and two other
                            clipper ships being built at those ports have yet been transferred to
                            neutrals, and I have consequently told Captain Rodgers that, as at
                            present advised, those vessels at sea are liable to capture. The Niagara
                            and Sacramento are at present at Flushing. I hear of no confederate
                            ships now afloat in European waters.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Our indefatigable consul at Nantes writes
                            me that an agent at St. Nazaire and Belle Isle is now essential to
                            enable him to communicate promptly with the United States vessels on the
                            French coast, and that the use of the telegraph is occasionally
                            indispensable. He asked me if he would be allowed for such necessary
                            expenditures. To this I have answered as follows:</p>
                        <p>“There is no doubt but that you will be allowed for such necessary
                            expenses as you incur in the employ of agents at St. Nazaire, Belle
                            Isle, or elsewhere, and for telegrams. It is only necessary that the
                            right to spend money for these things be <hi rend="italic"
                                >prudently</hi> exercised and proper <hi rend="italic">vouchers be
                                taken</hi> by you when you make payment.”</p>
                        <p>Any expenses he may incur in these matters will doubtless be small in
                            amount.</p>
                        <p>You have in your department copies of all the papers in reference to
                            those vessels at Bordeaux and Nantes. If our ships-of-war should seize
                            them at sea, does it seem to you that France would have any just ground
                            of complaint? I ask, because it is not to be doubted, if seized while
                            under the French flag, before delivery to the confederates, there would
                            be rightly or wrongly a serious question made by this government—a
                            question which might lead to hostilities between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>I send you herewith copies of two letters lately received—one from our
                            consul at Nantes, the other from Captain Rodgers, of the Iroquois.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Iroquois anchored off St. Nazaire
                                on Friday night, and entered the port yesterday morning. I shall
                                sail at midnight for Bordeaux.</p>
                            <p>Our consul at Nantes joined me here last night, and has given me much
                                useful information.</p>
                            <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0163"/>
                            <p>I have seen, while passing them, the two rebel corvettes which are
                                lying in the basin here, and have caused them to be closely
                                observed. They are very formidable looking vessels, apparently of
                                about eighteen hundred tons, able to carry heavy batteries, fully
                                rigged, likely to sail and steam well, able to keep the sea for a
                                long time, and will probably be superior in force to the greater
                                part of our own cruisers. They seem to have been fitted with a view
                                to make comfortable their officers and men, to be specially adapted
                                to remain a long time on the ocean, and to make great havoc among
                                our merchant ships. No expense seems to have been spared in their
                                construction. It is believed here that their guns have been made at
                                this place, and no one appears to doubt their having been built for
                                the rebels. Mr. Montagnie keeps you so well informed of the details
                                of their equipment, that it is unnecessary for me to dwell upon
                                it.</p>
                            <p>I am much obliged by your letter of the 25th instant, which I had the
                                honor to receive last night. If I meet either the Shanghai or San
                                Francisco at sea, even upon their trial trips, under the French
                                flag, I shall do my utmost to capture them, unless otherwise advised
                                by you.</p>
                            <p>It will, however, not be easy for the Iroquois to look after the
                                vessels at Bordeaux, St. Nazaire, and Calais; nor is it easy to keep
                                up communication with our consuls at Nantes and Bordeaux, both
                                somewhat remote from the sea, while the French authorities are so
                                sensitive as to the presence of our ships-of-war in their
                                waters.</p>
                            <p>After leaving Bordeaux, I shall return to Belle isle to communicate
                                with the consul at Nantes, probably three or four days from the
                                present time.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your most obedient
                                servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In continuation of my reports
                                concerning the rebel ships at St. Nazaire I learn that, one day last
                                week, thirty-five tons of the bituminous mixture for firing steamers
                                was put on board the San Francisco, and during a day her machinery
                                was kept working. She also sailed about the dock. I am informed, by
                                a person who was aboard, that the machinery worked well, giving
                                satisfaction. This coal was put on board from the wharf, the vessel
                                coming along side of it. She now occupies the outside position in
                                the dock, and could go to sea in five or ten days, if pressed.</p>
                            <p>I am informed by a French pilot, who is now on board the Iroquois
                                permanently, and who, at my request, with the consent of Captain
                                Rodgers, went on board the Shanghai yesterday at 11 o’clock, that he
                                was informed by the keeper that Mr.———, (he could not recall the
                                name,) the American in command of the work on the ships, (doubtless
                                Hansenson,) had given him positive orders to let no one on board
                                while the northern corvette was in port; that the ships would both
                                be ready to sail in a month; that they were to have nineteen cannon,
                                120-pounders; two were to point through tie stern lights of the
                                captain’s cabin, eight were to be on each side, and pivot on the
                                forecastle deck. He said they had not been, and would not be, sold;
                                they were confederate ships. This keeper did not know my informant
                                was pilot of the Iroquois, nor that he had any connexion with me. I
                                give this information as I received it. He must be <pb n="144"
                                    xml:id="pg_144" facs="0164"/>mistaken about the calibre of the
                                cannon. I omitted to say that the keeper added that they were to go
                                to Sweden for their guns.</p>
                            <p>As soon as it was known at St. Nazaire that an American war ship was
                                in sight, the ports were all closed, and mats were hung along the
                                wharf side of the ship. The gate upon the shore plank was shut, and
                                orders given to admit none but workmen aboard. This Frenchman only
                                got on board through the name of his cousin, who rigged the ships.
                                The rigger’s name is Mogart, of Cherbourg. The pilot said Mogart
                                said that he was working for and paid by the confederate
                                authorities. The pilot could not tell me from whom his cousin Mogart
                                received his pay. Could you, sir, send me a copy of the diplomatic
                                correspondence for the last year, which contains Mr. Seward’s
                                instructions to Mr. Adams concerning the iron-clads of England? I
                                have not yet received a copy, and had promised it to Captain
                                Rodgers, thinking I had one. He desired to know what had been the
                                determination of our government about that matter.</p>
                            <p>I am, sir, very repectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            occasion, and had so informed the captain of the Kearsarge; yet, in
                            obedience to your instructions subsequently received, I again said to
                            him that our government disapproved and repudiated the action of Captain
                            Winslow in that respect, and had instructed Mr. Adams to communicate
                            such disapproval to the British government, and in like manner had
                            instructed me to communicate such disapproval to this government.</p>
                        <p>That the government of the United States had not admitted, and would not
                            admit, directly or inferentially, that the Alabama was a regular
                            ship-of-war. So far, therefore, as the error of Captain Winslow can be
                            corrected by the action of this legation, or by your department, it
                            seems to me it has been done.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Having received notice from Captain
                            Rodgers, of the United States steamer Iroquois, that he was off the
                            coast of France watching the confederate ships now being built at
                            Bordeaux and Nantes, and that he would seize them on their trial trips
                            should he meet them at sea, I addressed a note to M. Drouyn de l’Huys, a
                            copy of which I herewith enclose. He informed me yesterday that he had
                            at once forwarded a copy of my note to the minister of marine, and
                            should he be informed by that minister that these vessels, or either of
                            them, had been conveyed to a neutral, he would at once apprise me of the
                            fact. The Yeddo, in the first place, and lately the Osacca, being two of
                            the four clipper ships constructed under that contract for the
                            confederates, having been delivered to Prussia, and being now under her
                            flag, would seem to increase the probabilities of the other two ships
                            having the same or a like destination.</p>
                        <p>I desire, therefore, to be very careful to obtain all possible
                            information before attempting to seize these vessels.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Ministre</hi>: I regret to be under
                                the necessity of again troubling your excellency as to the ships now
                                or recently being built at Nantes and Bordeaux for the so-called
                                confederates of the south. I do so to prevent, if possible, any
                                difficulty springing up between France and the United States.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency has in possession evidence that four clipper ships
                                and two iron-clads were contracted for by these parties, and have
                                been in the course of construction at these two ports. As respects
                                two of these vessels, the Yeddo and Osacca, they have been disposed
                                of, it would seem, to a power neutral as respects the United States;
                                but your excellency has given me no assurance that the two other
                                clipper ships at Nantes, and the iron-clad at Bordeaux, or either of
                                them, have been disposed of in like manner. These vessels, so far as
                                I have knowledge, are yet the property of the confederates, and one
                                or more are about to go to sea. They will, under these
                                circumstances, be subject to capture by our cruisers. In the hope of
                                preventing any unpleasant questions between our governments, I beg
                                your excellency will state, in reply, if you have knowledge of any
                                change of ownership in either of the vessels above referred to.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: By my despatch, No. 536, I informed you
                            that, to avoid difficulty, I had asked of M. Drouyn de l’Huys if he knew
                            of any change in the ownership of <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146"
                                facs="0166"/>those vessels that were being built at Bordeaux and
                            Nantes for the confederates, stating that I asked the question directly
                            in the hope of avoiding difficulty with the French government, in the
                            event of the seizure of these vessels by our cruisers. That as matters
                            now stood, we should feel ourselves authorized to seize them so soon as
                            they appeared, even on their trial trips, outside of French waters, and
                            one of these vessels I knew was then about to go out on such a trip. He
                            answered that if he learned of any change in the property of these
                            vessels, he would inform me. As yet I have received no such information,
                            but I am now informed by our consul at Nantes that orders have come down
                            to that port, withdrawing the permit to such vessels to make trial trips
                            heretofore granted.</p>
                        <p>This has obviously grown out of a knowledge of our intentions to seize
                            them, and the fact that the Iroquois was lying off the coast on the
                            watch. It would seem, therefore, that this government, like ourselves,
                            is desirous of avoiding cause for difficulty.</p>
                        <p>I regret to learn from Captain Rodgers, of the Iroquois, that his ship is
                            already ordered by the Secretary of the Navy away from European waters.
                            She will scarcely have appeared here before she is sent away. The
                            captain, by the way, makes complaint of French officials at Bordeaux,
                            for want of due courtesy on their part in not returning the salute of
                            his ship on her entering that port. I shall call the attention of M.
                            Drouyn de l’Huys to this subject, not with a view really to serious
                            complaint or to an exchange of diplomatic notes on such a subject, but
                            in return for a like course upon his part in the late case of the
                            Niagara at Cherbourg.</p>

                            doubted that they are unfriendly to the United States. But I think I
                            hazard little in saying that they forebode even more of inconvenience to
                            whatever government may exist in Mexico than of ultimate harm to our own
                            country.</p>
                        <p>It is hardly to be apprehended that the insurgents will come out of the
                            present civil war with any great capacity for establishing slavery in
                            Mexico. It may, however, be well for you to ascertain how far such
                            schemes of his find support in the councils of the Emperor of
                            France.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received your despatch of the 1st
                            of September, No. 532, together with the letters of Captain Rodgers and
                            Mr. de la Montagnie, annexed thereto, and have submitted these papers to
                            the President. The answer which you gave to our consul at Nantes, on the
                            subject of agency at St. Nazaire and Belle Isle, and telegraph expenses,
                            is fully approved.</p>
                        <p>We understand that the two corvettes now at Nantes, namely, the Shanghai
                            and San Francisco, were built for, and are owned by, our rebel enemies,
                            and are designed to be armed and used in war against the United States.
                            We have no information that they have been sold to any neutral power or
                            persons, and we have no guarantees against them if they are permitted to
                            leave the port where they lie, and have no reason to believe they would
                            be withheld from actual hostilities by France, or any foreign power
                            whose flag they might assume to carry. It will, therefore, be the duty
                            of our naval officers to capture them on the high seas, if possible, and
                            send them into court for adjudication. Without the formality of a
                            special and pointed communication, you have let Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys
                            understand the views of this government upon this subject, and thus
                            afforded him an opportunity, if he desires, to prevent the departure of
                            the vessels.</p>

                            arrived at Bremerhaven, and that she was immediately placed in charge of

                            few weeks. I will thank you to ascertain whether this vessel is one of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my despatch No. 536 I informed you of
                            my application to the French government to learn if it knew of any
                            change in the ownership of the vessels building for the confederates at
                            Bordeaux and Nantes, and I enclosed you at the same time a copy of my
                            communication, which states the friendly purpose of my question. To this
                            I received a courteous and friendly answer from M. Drouyn de l’Huys. But
                            subsequently I have received through the Foreign Office, from M.
                            Chasseloup-Laubat, the minister of marine, a reply not at all in the
                            spirit of my note, but in a fault-finding and somewhat dictatorial
                            spirit. Of this I herewith send a copy and its translation.</p>
                        <p>Having in my official intercourse here observed the punctilious
                            requirements of this government, I have tried to avoid on all occasions
                            anything which might tend to wound its self-love; but this reply,
                            unexpected, and I think wholly uncalled for, demanded, as it seemed to
                            me, an explicit rejoinder. I have made it in temperate terms, I think,
                            and herewith send you a copy.</p>
                        <p>We now have, at all events, as a result of this correspondence, what we
                            have not had before, <hi rend="italic">in writing,</hi> a distinct
                            promise that neither of these four vessels shall be delivered to the
                            confederates. It is true they may say, in the further progress of this
                            question, as they did in the case of the Yeddo and Osacca, that all they
                            can do is to exercise <hi rend="italic">due diligence</hi> to prevent
                            such delivery, but this diligence will, without doubt, be much increased
                            by the consciousness that such promise has been made by them and
                            accepted by us.</p>

                            <p>M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Le Ministre and dear Colleague</hi>: You did
                                me the honor to transmit to me the 5th of this month the copy of a
                                letter which M. the minister of the United States had written to you
                                on the 29th of August last, on the subject of the two clipper ships
                                in course of construction at Nantes, and the two iron-clad vessels
                                in the ship-yards at Bordeaux. These vessels are still, according to
                                him, the property of the confederates, and this, circumstance would
                                subject them, if they went to sea, to being captured by the federal
                                cruisers.</p>
                            <p>I recently authorized M. Voruz, senior, to proceed to a trial of the
                                engines of the Shanghai and of the San Francisco. This step is
                                indispensable to insure the sale of these ships, and we could not
                                refuse it without prejudice to the interests of our commerce, but,
                                as in the case of the Yeddo and Osacca, I made known to this
                                constructor that the two above mentioned ships could not
                                definitively leave the Loire until he should have proved to the
                                department of foreign affairs their regular sale to a foreign
                                non-belligerent power. It would only be then, in case your
                                excellency made known to me that this be so, that I would give the
                                necessary authorization to M. the chief of service at Nantes.</p>
                            <p>The same precautions will be taken in regard to the two iron-clad
                                vessels at Bordeaux; but, as far as I know, no step has yet been
                                taken concerning their armament.</p>
                            <p>We can then give to M. the minister of the United States the
                                assurance that the four vessels in question will not be delivered to
                                the Confederate States. (“Nous pouvons done donner à M. le ministre
                                des États Unis l’assurance que les quatre navires en question ne
                                seront pas livrés aux États Confédérés.”)</p>
                            <p>This being well established, I cannot avoid calling to the attention
                                of your excellency that the letter of Mr. Dayton is conceived in
                                terms that we cannot accept, if it contains, as seems to result from
                                a phrase of M. the minister of the United States, the threat of
                                seizing the vessels whose trial trips I believe it my duty to
                                authorize, and that upon the occasion of these very trial trips. It
                                should not, indeed, be forgotten that these vessels under the French
                                flag, manned by a French crew, are still French; it would only be
                                when they were delivered to an enemy of the northern States that the
                                federal vessels might seize them. But, as I have above said, this
                                delivery shall not take place, and our declaration ought to suffice.
                                We have shown sufficient loyalty when, in a recent circumstance, we
                                stopped all sale, all departure of a ship, in order that our
                                sincerity might not be doubted; and since the commencement of the
                                war, the government of the Emperor has observed quite scrupulously
                                the rules of the strictest neutrality, in order that no one might be
                                permitted to raise doubts on this point. I add, M. le minister and
                                dear colleague, that it would be fortunate not to find in Mexico
                                more American arms and American combatants than the States of the
                                north have met of French combatants and French arms among the
                                confederates.</p>
                            <p>However, to avoid new difficulties, I have given directions until
                                further orders to suspend the trials of the San Francisco and of the
                                Shanghai. I desire that you should have an interview on this subject
                                with Mr. Dayton.</p>
                            <p>At the same time, if M. the minister of the United States persists in
                                his menace, the ships would none the less make their trial trips,
                                but then under the protection of one of our iron-clad vessels. In
                                fine, from the moment that an attempt should be made against a
                                vessel under such circumstances, we would find ourselves under the
                                necessity of forbidding all American vessels of the north to remain
                                any longer in French waters.</p>
                            <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0172"/>
                            <p>To sum the matter up, M. le minister and dear colleague, without
                                awaiting the proof which the constructors of Nantes and Bordeaux
                                will have to produce to your department on the subject of the
                                regular sale of the two clipper ships, and the two iron-clad
                                batteries above mentioned, in order that they may be authorized to
                                leave these two ports, your excellency will appreciate if the
                                preceding observations would not permit you to answer in a
                                peremptory manner the reclamation of Mr. Dayton.</p>
                            <p>Accept, &amp;c.,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Ministre</hi>: I have the honor to
                                acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated the 22d instant, which
                                encloses the copy of a letter received by your excellency from the
                                minister of marine, &amp;c., under date of the 17th instant, and
                                this last letter your excellency informs me “contains the answer of
                                the government of the Emperor to the observations” in my letter of
                                the 29th August last, In that letter I stated to your excellency
                                that the two vessels at Nantes, and the two iron-clads at Bordeaux,
                                built under contract for the confederates, still remained, so far as
                                I had knowledge, “the property of the confederates,” and one or more
                                of them, as I was informed, was about to go to sea, and under these
                                circumstances would be “subject to capture by our cruisers.” I then
                                added that, “in the hope of preventing any unpleasant questions
                                between our governments, I begged your excellency to state, in
                                reply, if you had knowledge of any change of ownership in either of
                                the vessels above referred to.”</p>
                            <p>This letter, written in the kindest spirit and for the express
                                purpose of avoiding all occasion for complaint on the part of
                                France, does not seem to have been received by his excellency the
                                minister of marine in a like spirit, but rather in the spirit of
                                complaint and crimination. He says: “We have shown sufficient
                                loyalty when, in a recent circumstance, we stopped all sale, all
                                departure of a ship, in order that our sincerity might not be
                                doubted,” &amp;c. I beg to assure his excellency that nothing in my
                                note of inquiry, to which his is or purported to be an answer,
                                implied the slightest doubt of the <hi rend="italic">sincerity</hi>
                                of his government. The only tear I ever expressed on this subject
                                was, that the French government might put more faith in the
                                representations of the parties interested in these vessels than I
                                believed him entitled to. His excellency does not stop here, but,
                                proceeding in a like spirit, goes out of his way to inform you that
                                it would be fortunate not to find in Mexico more American arms and
                                more American combatants than the States of the north have met of
                                French combatants and French arms among the confederates. In answer
                                to this suggestion, I am constrained to remind his excellency that
                                the government of the United States not only stopped the exportation
                                of arms to Mexico, but it promptly stopped even an incipient
                                movement towards the organization of men within its territory to
                                take part in the war in that country. They did not wait until the
                                organization was complete and ready to move; and tell France, in the
                                mean time, we will prevent, or try to prevent, the passing of this
                                force into Mexican territory. I am constrained, likewise, to remind
                                his excellency, that when, in the late war between France and
                                England on the one side, and Russia on the other, complaint was made
                                by the allies that a ship-of-war was being built in one of the ports
                                of the United States for Russia, the United States did not delay its
                                action until the ship was complete and ready for delivery, but they
                                acted at once, and the construction of the ship was stayed until the
                                end of the war. (See papers accompanying my communication of April
                                13, 1863.)</p>
                            <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0173"/>
                            <p>If as his excellency implies, more of American arms and American
                                combatants are found in Mexico than of French arms and French
                                combatants are found among the confederates, (of which I have no
                                knowledge,) it would, I should think, be readily accounted for
                                without imputing any neglect to the government of the United States.
                                While France is separated from the confederates by from three to
                                four thousand miles of sea, the United States has, with Mexico, its
                                next neighbor, a coterminous boundary of some fifteen hundred miles,
                                next to and adjoining which is the nomadic and adventurous
                                population of our western country.</p>
                            <p>The communication of his excellency then calls your attention to the
                                terms of my letter, which, he says, imply a “menace,” (being a
                                threat of seizing these vessels,) which he says they cannot accept,
                                and thus the very object of my letter, which was to prevent by
                                preliminary inquiry a wrongful seizure of these vessels, is itself
                                converted into offence. Having been informed that our naval
                                officers, on the evidence that our government had received of the
                                ownership of these vessels by the confederates, would feel
                                themselves justified in seizing them if met in the open sea, and
                                supposing, as I did, that the property in these vessels, or some of
                                them, might have passed (as in the case of the Yeddo and Osacca)
                                into neutral hands, I thought to avoid all just cause of complaint
                                by the inquiry if the authorities of France knew of any such change
                                of property, meaning in that event to advise or direct that they be
                                not interfered with. There was no menace and no implication of
                                menace to seize these vessels except as <hi rend="italic"
                                    >confederate</hi> property, and it so expressly appeared on the
                                face of my communication. I cannot conceive, therefore, how this
                                could be justly construed into an offence to France. It is true, his
                                excellency says in his letter that it should not, indeed, be
                                forgotten that these vessels under the French flag and manned by a
                                French crew are still French, and that we have no right to seize
                                them until after delivery to an enemy. I do not so understand the
                                law. The vessels in question are contraband of war—contraband in the
                                strictest sense of that word. When found steaming on the open sea,
                                every presumption is that they are destined to their owner. Nor does
                                the fact that they fly a French flag and are navigated by a French
                                crew change that legal presumption. If his excellency’s principle be
                                right, nothing in a neutral’s possession can be seized at sea, and
                                the whole doctrine of contraband is abolished. His excellency the
                                minister of marine then gives us notice that if a menace to seize
                                these ships be yet persisted in, “the ships will none the less make
                                their trial trips, but then under the protection of one of the
                                iron-clad vessels” of France; and, in fine, he says that “from the
                                moment an attempt shall be made against a vessel under such
                                circumstances, we would find ourselves under the necessity of
                                forbidding all American vessels of the north to remain any longer in
                                French waters.” Were I disposed to take exception, this language of
                                express menace would be justly open to complaint; but I prefer
                                rather to consider it as simply a statement in advance of the policy
                                or purpose of the French government, without supposing it to mean or
                                imply that the action of the government of the United States may be
                                influenced or controlled by the threat contained in it. Viewed in
                                this light, I can only say, in reply, that France will, doubtless,
                                in the event contemplated, take such course (subject, I should hope,
                                to the rules of international law) as her dignity and interests may
                                require; but she will not fail, I trust, to remember that the ports
                                and waters of the United States are of quite as much importance to
                                the ships of France as are those of France to the ships of the
                                United States. International right and courtesy are of necessity
                                reciprocal; when, therefore, she speaks of closing her ports against
                                us, she cannot doubt, however much we would regret the necessity,
                                that the same measure of justice and courtesy which she metes out to
                                us will, of necessity, be measured to her in return.</p>
                            <p>But notwithstanding the general tone of his excellency’s
                                communication, I am rejoiced to perceive that, to avoid, as he says,
                                new difficulties, he has given orders to suspend the trial trips of
                                the San Francisco and of the Shanghai, and has, at <pb n="154"
                                    xml:id="pg_154" facs="0174"/>the same time, given me the
                                “assurance that the four vessels in question will not be delivered
                                to the Confederate States,” and this assurance he has repeated with
                                emphasis, adding, at the same time, that this “our declaration ought
                                to suffice.” This does not leave me to rely on the verbal assurance
                                or good faith of the parties interested in these vessels, but
                                substitutes in lieu thereof the direct assurance and responsibility
                                of the French government, and I am sure that I but anticipate the
                                wishes of my government when I say promptly it does “suffice.”</p>
                            <p>Immediately upon the receipt of the communication containing this
                                assurance, I sent to the commander of the United States ship
                                Niagara, at Antwerp, a letter, informing him that if, “under the
                                circumstances, the vessels in question or either of them are met at
                                sea on their trial trips, under a French flag and with a French
                                crew, it would be expedient and proper, in my judgment, not to
                                interfere with them.” This letter has been received by the commander
                                of the Niagara, and a copy of it sent, as I am informed, to the
                                captain of the Sacramento. These are the only two ships-of-war of
                                the United States now remaining, so far as I know, in these waters,
                                the Iroquois, recently here, having been ordered in service
                                elsewhere.</p>
                            <p>I avail myself of this occasion to renew to your excellency the
                                assurance of my highest consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I saw M. Drouyn de l’Huys on yesterday. He
                            received me in a very cordial manner, but said, smilingly, that I wrote
                            him a sharp despatch, in allusion to that I had sent him the day before,
                            enclosed to you in No. 542. I said no, but I had answered temperately a
                            sharp despatch he had sent to me from the minister of marine; and I
                            added that that despatch had surprised me very much, as there was
                            certainly nothing in my letter, to which this despatch from the minister
                            of marine purports to be an answer, to justify it. M. Drouyn de l’Huys
                            then said, they certainly intended to watch those vessels at Bordeaux
                            and Nantes as closely as possible; and he thought that this letter from
                            the minister of marine, stating that these vessels <hi rend="italic"
                                >should not be delivered to the confederates,</hi> put the matter in
                            the best shape for me. I told him I thought so, too, and was satisfied,
                            and had so informed the commanders of the Niagara and Sacramento.</p>
                        <p>I then read to him a letter from Captain Rodgers, of the Iroquois,
                            complaining that the authorities at Bordeaux had not returned his
                            salute; but stated, at the same time, that I did not wish to make it the
                            subject of diplomatic correspondence. He said he would mention the
                            matter to the minister of marine; but as it subsequently appeared that
                            they had no guns at Bordeaux with which to return the salute, that, he
                            supposed, would be a sufficient answer, to which I fully assented.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Unofficial newspaper statements
                                concerning the alleged entrance of the Mexican General Cortinas,
                                with an armed force, into the territory of Texas, within the United
                                States, with an assumption of military authority, have attracted the
                                attention of this department, as well as that of the minister of
                                France at this capital. The reports are contradictory and apparently
                                unreliable. The dignity of this government and its honor, as a
                                neutral power in the conflict which is raging in Mexico, render it
                                necessary that the President should be fully informed as early as
                                possible of the proceedings to which I have thus referred. I have
                                therefore to request that you will ascertain the facts and make a
                                report thereon to the Secretary of War. In the mean time I have the
                                pleasure to inform you that the proceeding is approved, by which, on
                                the occasion referred to, you gave notice to the said Cortinas that
                                his presence in arms within the United States, in an attitude of war
                                against a friendly power, with which the United States are at peace,
                                would not be tolerated. Although that proceeding indicates that you
                                have faithfully adhered to the instructions given to your
                                predecessors, yet, I think it proper to renew the injunction that on
                                no account, and in no way, must the neutrality of the United States
                                in the war between France and Mexico be compromised by our military
                                forces, or be suffered to be compromitted within your command by
                                either of the belligerents.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Bigelow has directed my attention to
                            an article contained in the Moniteur of the 11th of September, which
                            quoted a letter of the 9th of September from Lloyd’s agent at
                            Bremerhaven. The letter stated that one of the <pb n="156"
                                xml:id="pg_156" facs="0176"/>so-called confederate cruisers from
                            Bordeaux had entered Bremerhaven under the Prussian flag, and gone out
                            immediately under the confederate flag. Mr. Bigelow intimates that the
                            appearing of the article in the official journal of the French
                            government indicates an unfriendly feeling towards the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Happily, as I believe, the letter quoted is erroneous in fact. Your
                            acquaintance with the principles upon which the Moniteur is conducted
                            will enable you to judge better than I can whether the publication
                            requires explanations. If you think it does, you will ask them. We are
                            not now especially sensitive concerning the dispositions of foreign
                            governments, and we best maintain the national honor by avoiding a
                            querulous habit. At the same time, if this forbearance is likely to be
                            misunderstood abroad into indifference, or want of attention to the
                            national rights, we must ask explanations, however irksome the task may
                            be.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I send herewith a statement which has been
                            received from a very intelligent and perfectly reliable person, who is
                            well known to this government. It contains the result of a careful
                            observation of the clipper ships which are building at St. Nazaire for
                            the rebels, and shows that they are but too well adapted to warlike
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>I have to desire that you will communicate the information contained in
                            the paper to M. Drouyn de l’Huys, and ask for assurances that neither of
                            the two vessels shall be permitted to leave port to make war against the
                            United States. You will make known the result of this communication to
                            me for the information of this government. It is hardly necessary to say
                            that this government would receive with much satisfaction such
                            explanations as will relieve us of the necessity of looking for these
                            vessels on the high seas. The Secretary of the Navy will give proper
                            instructions to our naval forces in European waters concerning the
                            aforementioned vessels.</p>

                            in reference to Cortinas crossing the Rio Grande with his forces into
                            Texas, which you sent to me in your No. 656, to be used subject to my
                            discretion, I read to M. Drouyn de l’Huys. The facts had got into the
                            newspapers with various comments, and as I well knew the attention of
                            this government must have been called to the subject, I thought it
                            safest at once to inform them of the prudent action of the government of
                            the United States in the premises. M. Drouyn de l’Huys said this action
                            of our government was a matter of interest, and begged me to let him
                            take a copy of the extract, which I did. He remarked that it was
                            important to him to have the means of explaining the facts at once, if
                            the subject should be referred to by his Majesty.</p>

                                    Day, in relation to the Mexican force under Cortinas, has been
                                    received. Colonel Day’s action, so far as is known here, accords
                                    with our neutral obligations, and is approved. The Mexican
                                    refugees are entitled to an asylum in our territory, when they
                                    deliver up their arms and munitions, and restore any prisoners
                                    or booty that they may have taken from the French; they will not
                                    be received into the service of the United States for service on
                                    the Rio Grande frontier, but may be enlisted for the general
                                    service. In this case they will be sent to the city, either
                                    before or after enlistment, to be organized, armed, and
                                    equipped. Their enlistment may be for one, two, and three years,
                                    but preferably for the shorter term, and their duty thereafter
                                    will be determined by the circumstances of the service.</p>
                                <p>As an armed enemy of France, this force will not be tolerated in
                                    our territory; and if this be the intention of Cortinas, the
                                    commanding officer will be instructed to regard, and, as far as
                                    his power extends, to treat this force as enemies of the United
                                    States.</p>
                                <p>You will please instruct Colonel Day, or the commander at Brazos
                                    Santiago, accordingly, and, in the contingency of any of
                                    Cortinas’s force entering our service, give the necessary
                                    instructions in relation to enlistment, transfer to this city,
                                    and the disposition to be made of private property. The public
                                    property of the Mexican government remains, of course, in the
                                    custody of the United States, until disposed of by proper
                                    authority.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel</hi>: Yesterday, the 6th of
                                    September, the hostile forces of General Cortinas displayed
                                    themselves before our lines and made a feint to attack the place
                                    which we hold. General Cortinas, who knows the march of our
                                    several columns made against him, managed to move without our
                                    knowledge, and with your powerful aid succeeded in passing his
                                    troops to your side of the river with arms and baggage.</p>
                                <p>The first squadron of cavalry afforded you immediate aid to fight
                                    the confederates.</p>
                                <p>This morning, the passing of all these forces being effected, you
                                    gave them provisions, all that they wanted. According to the
                                    facts, and according to the law of nations, which none can
                                    distrust, I am bound to consider the forces of General Cortinas
                                    as troops belonging to the United States government, which
                                    government now holds the responsibility for their future
                                    conduct. In any enterprise I might undertake I must be certain
                                    not to encounter them on my road, either now or later.</p>
                                <p>If perchance, colonel, you have some objections to propose to the

                                    the receipt of your communication, dated September 7, 1864, from
                                    the hands of Captain Visconti. In reply, I would respectfully
                                    state that you are laboring under an error with regard to the
                                    forces of General Cortinas receiving provisions from me on the
                                    morning of the 6th of September, Understanding that the enemy
                                    had a large drove of cattle at our front, I sent a small force
                                    of mounted men with instructions to capture and drive them into
                                    camp, if possible, for the sustenance of my command. I would
                                    further state that I have not as yet been officially informed
                                    that General Cortinas is within my lines, and that I will at
                                    once send an officer with a sufficient escort to him, and if he
                                    is within my lines I will demand that he shall surrender all
                                    arms and munitions of war to the United States.</p>
                                <p>I take this occasion to assure the commander of the French forces
                                    at Bagdad that I shall not for a moment countenance the
                                    occupation of United States soil by any armed force except our
                                    own, and especially by a force hostile to the French government,
                                    which has so long been on friendly terms with the United States.
                                    Desiring that this harmony may long continue to exist,</p>

                                    it is his desire to receive protection from the United States

                                    herewith the following report of a slight engagement which took
                                    place at “Palmetto ranche,” on the Rio Grande river, about
                                    sixteen miles from these headquarters. Learning from my scouts
                                    that the rebels had collected a large number of cattle which
                                    they intended to sell to the French troops at Bagdad, and that
                                    said cattle were in a bend in the river just above the “White
                                    rancke,” I determined, after mature deliberation, to try and
                                    capture them, and at the same time drive back the rebels from
                                    their position, as they had been annoying us in various ways,
                                    very much during the past few Says. Accordingly, on the morning
                                    of the 6th, I ordered a squadron of the 1st Texas cavalry and
                                    one piece of artillery (12-pounder howitzer) to proceed up the
                                    country and accomplish the object above named. Major E. J. Noyes
                                    commanded the expedition; Captain P. J. Temple the cavalry;
                                    Lieutenant A. Hills, 1st Missouri artillery, the artillery.</p>
                                <p>After crossing the Boca Chica Pass skirmishers were thrown out to
                                    the right and left, and as they advanced the rebels slowly
                                    retired, until reaching the “Palmetto ranche,” a stand was made
                                    and brisk firing ensued. The main body arrived soon after, and a
                                    fair prospect of a heavy engagement was apparent) as the rebels
                                    were having re-enforcements from above, but our artillery opened
                                    a very effective fire with shell, which had the effect to
                                    disperse the enemy, and the last seen of him he was flying in
                                    confusion in the direction of Brownsville.</p>
                                <p>Word being sent me by the major commanding of his position, I
                                    advanced three miles with a detachment of the 91st Illinois
                                    infantry volunteers to re-enforce him in case of necessity; it
                                    was not needed, however, and the whole force returned to camp on
                                    the morning of the 7th.</p>
                                <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0182"/>
                                <p>The expedition was successful in its results, for a lot of cattle
                                    were captured and brought in, and the rebels forced to leave
                                    this section of the country.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major</hi>: I have the honor to submit the
                                    following report of the action taken by me relative to the fact
                                    that an armed body of Mexican troops had crossed the Rio Grande,
                                    above our lines, of which I advised you in a recent report.</p>
                                <p>In the evening of the 8th of September I ordered Major E. J.
                                    Noyes, commanding detachment first Texas cavalry, to move with
                                    his command up the Rio Grande, the point where the troops had
                                    crossed the river, and instructed him to demand of them the
                                    surrender of all arms and warlike stores, and to offer them the
                                    protection of the United States as refugees; I also instructed
                                    him that if he found it necessary, in order to defend himself
                                    against the rebels, to allow the refugees to temporarily resume
                                    their arms. Major Noyes proceeded agreeably to the above
                                    instructions, and the Mexicans willingly surrendered upon the
                                    demand being made. They were not commanded by Governor Cortinas,
                                    as I was at first informed, and hence reported to you, but
                                    Colonel Miguel Echazarretta, Cortinas not having moved his
                                    headquarters to this side of the river. Shortly after the
                                    surrender had been effected, our forces were attacked by the
                                    rebels with nearly double their number, and, according to my
                                    instructions, the refugees were allowed to resume their arms and
                                    fought bravely with our men. After a short engagement, in which
                                    one piece of Mexican artillery was used, the rebels were
                                    repulsed with great loss. They rallied and again attacked, and
                                    were again repulsed; so a third time; after which Major Noyes,
                                    being short of ammunition, fell back two miles and took a
                                    stronger position. Fearing that the rebels would receive
                                    re-enforcements from Brownsville, and would succeed in getting
                                    possession of the artillery which the refugees had surrendered
                                    to us, I advanced on the 11th, with two hundred of the 91st
                                    Illinois and two pieces of artillery, as far as White’s ranche,
                                    and ordered Major Noyes to fall back with his command to that
                                    place. The rebels followed with a force of about six hundred,
                                    but I soon routed them with my artillery. On the morning of the
                                    12th I returned to camp, bringing with me all refugees who had
                                    crossed the river, their arms and warlike stores. Affixed to
                                    this report is a statement (which I respectfully submit as a
                                    part of the same) with regard to the number of refugees and the
                                    number and character of their arms. No casualties attended us in
                                    any of the above encounters except one United States soldier
                                    captured and several refugees. We took no prisoners, but the
                                    killed and wounded of the enemy must have been great. The
                                    refugees have been very quiet and orderly since their arrival in
                                    camp, and I understand that many of them evince a desire to
                                    enlist in the United States army.</p>

                                    building at St. Nazaire, France, well adapted for war purposes,
                                    and there is good reason to believe that they are designed for
                                    the insurgents. Should these vessels be permitted to leave port
                                    under such circumstances as to warrant the belief that they are
                                    to make war against the United States, you will not hesitate to
                                    seize them and send them into one of our ports for
                                    adjudication.</p>

                            receipt of your despatch of the 29th of September, No. 542, and also of
                            your despatch of the 30th of September, No. 543. The first of these
                            papers is accompanied by a correspondence which has taken place between
                            yourself and M. Drouyn de l’Huys on the subject of the detention of the
                            insurgent cruisers at Bordeaux and Nantes. It is a ground of sincere
                            satisfaction that you have since received from M. Drouyn de l’Huys
                            assurances that the vessels at Nantes will not be suffered to pass into
                            the hands of the insurgents.</p>
                        <p>I regret that in the discussion of this subject there arose an annoying
                            cause for irritation on the part of the minister of France. The
                            explanation you gave on that subject is approved, together with all your
                            proceedings in regard to the question which is now disposed of in a

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received the enclosed slip, cut
                            from the Courier de Lyon, from our vice-consul at that place. I send it,
                            with its translation, in the hope and expectation that you may give it
                            an explicit denial for publication at Lyons. Our vice-consul at that
                            place says this statement, and others of the like kind, are interfering
                            seriously with emigration to our country from that district of
                            France.</p>
                        <p>The official or semi-official journals of this country constantly publish
                            and republish matter of this kind. The whole government press of this
                            country, so far as the same has come under my observation, seems,
                            directly or indirectly, to make common cause against us. The fact that
                            it does so keeps me in a state of anxiety for the future. It can have no

                            <p>On the 29th of August, 1864, the ship Guerland, from Anvers, with 251
                                French and Belgian emigrants, engaged as laborers, arrived at the
                                entrance of Boston harbor. As soon as she was telegraphed, three
                                steamers, having on board a company of federal soldiers, went to
                                meet her. The passengers were ordered to sign a written engagement
                                and to go on board the steamers. It was an engagement to serve as
                                soldiers, and they could not obtain a translation thereof. They had
                                been promised (as workmen) a premium of 500 francs and a week’s
                                salary, payable on their arrival. The soldiers wanted to force them
                                to sign a paper they did not understand. They refused. They were
                                kept for twenty-four hours on board the steamer without food. On the
                                31st some of the passengers, who had money, were landed in Boston at
                                their own expense; the others (220) had to sign. They were
                                transferred to a fort. The engagements were exhibited to them and
                                translated. They were soldiers, and had to take the uniform. A
                                Frenchman (Sincrit) and two Belgians (Albreght and Verheyden)
                                refused the uniform and were put in irons. Those who obeyed received
                                each $100 in greenbacks.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The San Francisco, one of the corvettes
                            built at Nantes for the confederates, has just made her trial trip. She
                            had on hoard three officers of the imperial navy. She made but twelve
                            miles an hour, and scarcely gave satisfaction. But the presence of the
                            three officers of the imperial navy on board proves clearly that the
                            French government intended to deal fairly with us in reference to the
                            trial trip of this vessel. The Sphinx, one of the iron-clads at
                            Bordeaux, is about to leave. Her name has been changed to Staerkodder.
                            She goes out in charge of Captain Pater, the same person who took out
                            both the Yeddo and Osacca, and it is surmised she is bound for Denmark.
                            As to the report referred to by Mr. Bigelow, that one of these vessels
                            entered Bremerhaven under the Prussian flag, and left immediately under
                            the confederate flag, which Was copied into the Moniteur, it was in the
                            first place untrue; and the government of France, if called upon for
                            explanation, would have the ready response that this report was not
                            published in the official part of the paper, but like any other news of
                            interest, and for the accuracy of which they were not responsible. It is
                            worse than useless, therefore, to make it the subject of inquiry.
                            Scarcely a day, certainly not a week, passes in which there is not
                            something in that journal which would call for inquiry more loudly than
                            this.</p>

                            between France and the United States. I do not append to this despatch a
                            copy of this last communication of Mr. Bigelow, for the reason that you
                            have, without doubt, received a copy of it from the consulate.</p>
                        <p>M. Drouyn de l’Huys, on receiving it, said he would examine it with great
                            care. This is all I could expect of him, as there is nothing practical
                            expected to grow out of this correspondence.</p>
                        <p>M. Drouyn de l’Huys took occasion, in the course of the interview of
                            yesterday, to say he had received from Washington very satisfactory
                            explanations in reference to the action of our government in regard. to
                            the Mexican, troops under Cortinas which recently crossed the Rio Grande
                            into Texas. That these explanations were confirmatory, as he said, of
                            what I have already told him.</p>

                            to know the fact, but as our consul at Nantes has communicated it to me,
                            I state to you that the two rebel corvettes built at that place have
                            made their trial trips and returned into port. The Shanghai remained an
                            hour only in port after her return, and then again went to sea. I am
                            informed that a Mr. Delisle, who has been connected with the
                            confederates at Paris, as said, went out in the Shanghai when she left
                            the second time.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that on
                                the 30th day of September, A. D. 1864, the commandant of the French
                                forces in Acapulco ordered the vice-consul of the French to seize
                                the United States mail bag and to break the seal and take charge of
                                the contents.</p>
                            <p>The bag was taken while in transit from American steamer Golden City
                                to my office. Had the commandant required the mail matter, after I
                                had opened the bag and found a public mail therein, I should have
                                given it to him without protest, notwithstanding I am acting under
                                an arrangement between the French consul and our consul at Panama,
                                which was that I should open all mails coming into Acapulco and
                                distribute and forward to address, which arrangement has not been
                                disturbed until this sudden seizure of our mail bag and the seal
                                violated. Hence I deemed it my duty to protest against the
                                proceedings.</p>
                            <p>No plea of contraband matter or anything improper passing through the
                                mails was set up, but an assumed arbitrary power was exercised in
                                demolishing the sacredness of a government seal for civil
                                purposes.</p>

                                mail was not done under cover of military surveillance, but by a
                                civil officer of the French government, acting under your orders;
                                and, more especially, as this mail service is performed by the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatches, from No. 669 to No. 683,
                            both inclusive, have been duly received.</p>
                        <p>I am especially glad to find that you so cordially approve my action in
                            reference to the vessels which have been so long in the course of
                            construction for the confederates at Bordeaux and Nantes. I accepted the
                            assurance of this government that they should not be delivered to the
                            confederates, as well from respect to this government as from sound
                            policy. We have no force here which could at all interfere with the
                            French iron-clads, with which it was threatened to convoy them if
                            necessary on their trial trips, and it was certainly bad policy to get
                            in difficulty with this government on such a question if we could avoid
                            it. But the corvettes at Nantes have now made their trial trips and
                            returned into port.</p>
                        <p>One of them, our consul at that port reports to me, made fourteen and a
                            half knots, and the other sixteen knots per hour, an extraordinary
                            speed. Peru, it is said, is yet negotiating for one or both of them.
                            Commodore Craven, of the United States ship Niagara, has been to see me,
                            according to orders recently sent from Mr. Welles. I have informed him
                            of the present condition of things in respect to these vessels, and the
                            understanding between myself and this government, which had been
                            approved by you. Indeed, I have read to him your despatch No. 681. He
                            will, therefore, not feel it his duty, under the circumstances, to
                            attempt to seize either of those vessels built at Nantes. The
                            description of these vessels made to you, and a copy of which you have
                            forwarded to me, to be shown to M. Drouyn de l’Huys, is, in the existing
                            condition of things, of no use. You will recollect, too, that I have
                            already on my files a copy of the contract under which these vessels are
                            built, and, of course, much more accurate than any description, made by
                            a casual visitor on an outside inspection, can possibly be. Of this
                            contract you have long had a copy on the files of the State Department,
                            and M. Drouyn de l’Huys has likewise a copy on his files. Some person or
                            persons are constantly writing descriptions and information about these
                            vessels, which are not of the slightest service, and of which to suppose
                            us ignorant is to suppose our consul at Nantes (a most intelligent and
                            trustworthy officer) inattentive to the most obvious requirements of
                            official duty.</p>

                            for the purpose of communicating to him more in detail the orders and
                            proceedings of our government in reference to Cortinas and his force
                            which crossed the Rio Grande into Texas. The papers which you forwarded
                            to me on this subject were shown to him. They contained, in substance,
                            little that I bad not already said to him, and with which, when I
                            communicated it to him heretofore, he seemed entirely satisfied. If, on
                            reflection, he is disposed to complain, I suppose I will hear from him

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You will doubtless have observed that M.
                            Galvez, the minister from Peru at this court, has been recently recalled
                            and a successor appointed to the post. At our last interview M. Drouyn
                            de l’Huys informed me that he had again recently communicated the views
                            of France to Spain urging peace between her and Peru. He says,
                            furthermore, that Mr. Mercier, the new ambassador to that court, will go
                            out specially instructed to do what he can in the interest of peace
                            between those two countries. These things were mentioned to me
                            incidentally, and not, as it seemed to me, with any special view to have
                            them communicated by me to your department.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: A letter received from Commodore Craven,
                            of United States ship Niagara, sent to me last night, informed me that
                            Mr. Morse, United States consul at London, has sent a report to him that
                            Captain Semmes, late of the Alabama, is at Cape Bajado, on the coast of
                            Africa, with the Sea King and two other ships, preparing for a cruise,
                            and it was suggested that Commodore Craven should go with the Niagara to
                            that port. He sought to obtain my advice or direction in this matter. I
                            told him the information was too vague and unreliable to justify me in
                            advising so distant a cruise, but if he had full confidence in the
                            correctness of this information to go, not otherwise. The point
                            indicated is about 2,200 or 2,400 miles from Antwerp, where the Niagara
                            now lies, and which port he was directed by the Secretary of the Navy to
                            make his headquarters. I left the matter, therefore, to his own
                            judgment, and am not aware as yet to what conclusion he will come. I
                            have so frequently been deceived by these reports coming through Mr.
                            Morse that I have little confidence in their reliability.</p>
                        <p>I sincerely hope that the account we have received of the taking of the
                            Florida in the harbor of Bahia may be an erroneous statement of the
                            facts, or, if it be a correct statement of facts, then that the action
                            of the United States consul and the captain of the Wachusett may be
                            promptly disclaimed and they punished. The accounts published in all the
                            European papers (the Moniteur among the rest) make it out to be a gross
                            outrage on Brazil, committed after express warning from her authorities,
                            and an express promise on the part of our consul to respect the
                            neutrality of the port. I cannot believe that the facts are correctly
                            stated. If they are, it would be better for us that the Florida was yet
                            in the hands of the confederates.</p>

                            despatch of the 17th ultimo, No. 549, transmitting a slip from the
                            Courier de Lyon in regard to the alleged improper enlistment of certain
                            French and Belgian emigrants who arrived at Boston in the ship Guerland,
                            and informing me that our vice-consul at Lyons says that the statement
                            referred to, and others of a similar kind, are interfering seriously
                            with emigration to the United States from that district of France.</p>
                        <p>Complaints upon this subject have been received at the department from
                            some individuals directly, and from others through Baron Grabow, the
                            chargé of Prussia, and Mr. Blondeel, the minister from Belgium.
                            Explanations have consequently been asked, both of the War Department
                            and of the governor of Massachusetts, the persons referred to having
                            been incorporated in regiments of that State.</p>
                        <p>A copy of a reply of Governor Andrew is herewith transmitted. It seems to

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                                receipt from the Department of State of the communication addressed
                                to Mr. John P. Cumming, superintendent of immigration at New York,
                                and by you referred to this department, from Jean Barbier, jr., and
                                others, who claim to have been deceived and unfairly enlisted into
                                the military service of the United States, whose complaints you
                                desire me investigate.</p>
                            <p>In reply, I have the honor to enclose the report of Lieutenant
                                Colonel Wm. S. King, 35th Massachusetts volunteers, superintendent
                                of recruits in Massachusetts, who was personally present when the
                                men in question were landed and mustered, and to whose regiment they
                                have been assigned by the War Department.</p>
                            <p>The difficulty under which Barbier appears to labor would probably be
                                obviated by informing him that in this country a substitute, as soon
                                as mustered, stands upon the same footing as to promotion (as in all
                                other respects) as a volunteer; indeed, is a volunteer.</p>
                            <p>With regard to Krone and Papot, their complaints are entirely
                                groundless. It is beyond a doubt that they came here to be soldiers,
                                were knowingly mustered as such, and are to be regarded, and should
                                be treated, simply as deserters.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor also to acknowledge the receipt of several documents
                                from the Department of State of the United States, covering similar
                                cases of complaints, which are all in process of investigation, and
                                will be the subject of early and careful replies as soon as it is
                                possible to complete the needful inquiries.</p>

                                    on the contrary, informed previous to their sailing, by
                                    government officials at Antwerp and Hamburg, that they were
                                    going to the United States to enlist as soldiers, and that if
                                    any one of them wished to withdraw he was at perfect liberty so
                                    to do. A certificate to this effect, if obtained in season, will
                                    be found hereto appended, marked B. That upon their arrival at
                                    this port they were landed at Deer island, occupied exclusively
                                    by one of the charitable institutions of Boston, for the purpose
                                    of keeping the men out of the hands of sharpers; and that the
                                    Boston harbor police were on duty there to prevent depredations
                                    upon the city property and to quell the disturbances that arose
                                    among the men themselves. That they were there informed of the
                                    nature of the obligations they were about to assume by Dr.
                                    Jeffries, who speaks both French and German, whose high
                                    character is known to your excellency, and is a sufficient
                                    guarantee of the fidelity of his transactions and explanations,
                                    and whose statement is hereto appended, marked A.</p>
                                <p>That, so far from expecting to be employed in trades, their
                                    attention was pointed to myself as the commander of the regiment
                                    to which they were to be attached; and several of them, at their
                                    own request, were presented to me, and in particular the man
                                    Barbier, who preferred a request to be promoted as soon as
                                    possible; to which I replied that he would be recommended for
                                    promotion as soon as he had acquired a sufficient knowledge of
                                    our language and shown himself qualified to hold a commission.
                                    That others, who were rejected by the examining surgeon as
                                    physically unfit for the service, loudly appealed to me to
                                    accept them as soldiers, declaring that they came for that sole
                                    purpose; and no one of them could have been so simple as really
                                    to believe that even the philanthropists of Boston would pay $64
                                    for the passage and bestow a bounty of $100 to induce an
                                    emigrant to come to America to work at his trade. That in no
                                    case whatever was compulsion used, nor could any single person
                                    there doubt the purpose for which the papers were submitted for
                                    their signatures. Our officers were in uniform, the general
                                    conversation was of their destination, the very camp on
                                    Galloup’s island to which they were to be conveyed was in plain
                                    sight, and was shown to them, dotted with its white tents and
                                    barracks, and upon the departure of the first squad of about 100
                                    for the camp, the others, thinking that they had been rejected
                                    as recruits, broke out into violent demonstrations of
                                    disappointment and anger, and were only appeased by the
                                    assurances given them that they, too, would go to camp as soon
                                    as the formalities of enlistment could be completed.</p>
                                <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0195"/>
                                <p>That as to the Joss of clothing to the amount of $200 each, which
                                    was complained of, he would have been rash speculator who would
                                    have given $200 for the entire wardrobes of the whole party of
                                    nearly 400 men.</p>
                                <p>The difficulty with Barbier, who appeared to be a gentleman of
                                    education and had held a military commission, would seem to be
                                    his misapprehension of the position of a substitute in our
                                    service, and his ignorance of the fact that when mustered he
                                    stands on the same footing as to position and opportunities for
                                    promotion with any other volunteer. If this were explained to
                                    him, I think his discontent would cease.</p>
                                <p>Believing that this explanation covers every point presented in
                                    the complaint, I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your
                                    obedient servant,</p>

                                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel;</hi> In so far as the
                                        communication you send me relates to myself, I would
                                        respectfully report the following: I happened to have
                                        examined this man, Jean Barbier, and to have had
                                        considerable conversation with him on my own part, and as
                                        interpreter between yourself and him. I also acted as
                                        interpreter for the provost marshals when the men were sworn
                                        into the service, both in French and German. In this
                                        capacity I acted honestly and faithfully, and took a great
                                        deal of time to explain and translate the oath to the men
                                        before and at the time of their being sworn in.</p>
                                    <p>I do not remember to have had the conversation which private
                                        Barbier says I had with him; but if I did, my answer was
                                        correct, as the money he received would have no effect upon
                                        his promotion. It was not a bounty, substitutes receiving
                                        none from the United States or the State of Massachusetts. I
                                        explained to the men that they served in the place of some
                                        one who paid their expenses and the $100 they received. In
                                        reference to any compulsion, I would say that as there were
                                        none but infantry regiments open to those not speaking the
                                        English language, I myself, by personal application,
                                        succeeded in obtaining places in cavalry regiments for two
                                        or three men, which places they finally would not take, and
                                        did not, therefore, enter the service at all.</p>
                                    <p>By conversation with the men I ascertained that they came
                                        here to be soldiers, although, as they told me themselves,
                                        this could not of course be expressed in the contract which
                                        they all signed before embarking from Europe, for fear of
                                        international difficulty. I saw the contract printed in the
                                        English and foreign languages, and there was nothing in it
                                        in reference to being soldiers. The men knew they were
                                        making another with the United States when they were sworn
                                        in, which was in no way compulsory and not connected with
                                        the other. They said they were promised $100 in United
                                        States money and a free passage, which they received. I was
                                        greatly annoyed by those whom I rejected being clamorous to
                                        go with the others, they saying that they did not come here
                                        to work, but to be soldiers. Some of them showed me their
                                        papers, proving they had served at home and were recently
                                        discharged, and they felt on that account they ought to be
                                        fit for soldiers here.</p>
                                    <p>I remain, colonel, respectfully,</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In reply to the communication of
                                    October 8, which I had the honor to receive from you, covering a
                                    copy of a note from the consul general of Switzerland, with
                                    regard to the cases of Uster and others, recruits in the
                                    military service of the United States, concerning which cases
                                    you request me to cause investigation to be made, I herewith
                                    forward to you a letter addressed to me by M. D. Ross, esq., who
                                    is mentioned in the complaint of Uster and others as the person
                                    by whom they had been wronged.</p>
                                <p>I also forward herewith a copy of the report mentioned by Mr.
                                    Ross as having been made to me by Messrs. Forbes, Reed, and
                                    Dalton, in April last, whom I had requested to investigate the
                                    complaints made of ill treatment of the earlier emigrants.</p>
                                <p>In the same connexion, I beg to refer you, for additional
                                    information, to the communication addressed by me to you on this
                                    same general subject, under date of November 4, and to the
                                    reports of Lieutenant Colonel King, superintendent of recruiting
                                    service, and Surgeon B. J. Jeffries, which were therewith
                                    enclosed.</p>
                                <p>The general conclusion to which I arrive with regard to all the
                                    men brought here by Messrs. Allen and Ross is, that they all
                                    came for the express purpose of entering the military service—a
                                    purpose distinctly understood by each one of them before leaving
                                    Europe; that there was no deceit practiced upon them; that their
                                    enlistment upon arrival here was voluntary; and that those who
                                    now complain of fraudulent treatment do so without reasonable
                                    grounds, and probably in the hope that, by making a disturbance
                                    now, some pecuniary benefit may arrive to them, either by way of
                                    their premature discharge from the service which they contracted
                                    for by their voluntary enlistment, or by way of extorting from
                                    the parties who brought them over that portion of their military
                                    bounties which they assigned to those parties in reimbursement
                                    of the expenses and risks of bringing them over.</p>
                                <p>In this same connexion, I beg to make mention letters of Major F.
                                    N. Clarke, 5th artillery regulars, acting assistant provost
                                    marshal general, dated October 15 and October 21, addressed to
                                    Brigadier General Fry, Provost Marshal General of the United
                                    States, (with the documents thereto annexed,) as confirming this
                                    view of the subject. Those letters are, I presume, on the files
                                    of the War Department.</p>
                                <p>I have the honor to remain, with great respect, your obedient
                                    servant,</p>

                                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Governor</hi>: The documents referred to
                                        me, under date of October 12, by your excellency, “for such
                                        remarks as I might deem proper to make,” received my
                                        immediate attention, and have been carefully read and
                                        considered.</p>
                                    <p>Said documents set forth a complaint on the part of certain
                                        persons claiming to be natives of Switzerland, alleging that
                                        they have been forcibly made soldiers in the army of the
                                        United States, and that, “at the instance of a certain
                                        Charles Fisher, they have been advised to seek to be
                                        released from military service.” I have delayed my report
                                        upon this subject in order that the lapse of a little time
                                        might develop some facts which would be of use. Although the
                                        documents in question do not make such specific or definite
                                        statements as to render it certain that the complaining
                                        party is in any way identified with any transactions in
                                        which I have been concerned, yet I have but very little
                                        doubt that these Swiss are some men who came from Antwerp to
                                        Boston in one of several vessels consigned to my care,
                                        bringing in all several hundred persons who emigrated to
                                        this country for the sole purpose of enlisting in the United
                                        States army, whilst I have acted on the part of citizens of
                                        Massachusetts in furnishing them with the means necessary to
                                        come to the country as well as to facilitate their
                                        enlistment into the army after their arrival here. The
                                        statement made by these men is, however, so extravagant and
                                        so at variance with the truth—provided it should be made to
                                        appear that they are men with whom I have had anything to
                                        do—that I am entirely at a loss to know how to make a
                                        specific reply to their complaints, beyond a general denial
                                        of their truth, because I have no knowledge whatever of any
                                        such transactions as they allude to.</p>
                                    <p>But in order that all parties concerned may be able to form a
                                        correct conclusion as to whether these men have or have not
                                        any cause to complain of ill treatment by myself or
                                        associates, I will give, in brief, a general outline of that
                                        experiment on the part of citizens of Massachusetts for
                                        encouraging European emigration; and then, if it should
                                        eventually be made to appear that these men were included in
                                        our transactions, their case may be more clearly understood
                                        than as represented in their document.</p>
                                    <p>Soon after the war broke out in the United States it became
                                        apparent that the great demand for men for the army, as well
                                        as for laborers on the farms and in the workshops of the
                                        country, had given a great stimulus to the surplus
                                        unemployed population of Europe to emigrate and avail itself
                                        of the means of employment so readily to be obtained here.
                                        President Lincoln had suggested in his messages to Congress
                                        that foreign emigration should be encouraged, and Congress
                                        had legislated to that end. Availing ourselves of
                                        information obtained from European correspondents, in
                                        Germany especially, that there were thousands of young
                                        able-bodied men there who were anxious to emigrate to this
                                        country for the purpose of engaging in our military service,
                                        provided a free passage could be secured to them, and
                                        provided some responsible party could secure to them a
                                        specified sum of money and an opportunity to enlist
                                        immediately on their arrival in the United States, and
                                        taking into view the recommendation of the President and the
                                        legislation of Congress on the subject of encouraging
                                        European emigration, in connexion with the above-named facts
                                        and the great demand for men, it was determined on the part
                                        of a few of our patriotic citizens to try the experiment,
                                        which seemed to be so clearly suggested by Congress as well
                                        as by the people of Europe who wished to come here. An
                                        arrangement was made with Mr. Julian Allen, a well-known
                                        citizen of New York, to go to Europe with means at his
                                        command to furnish a free passage and pay all expenses
                                        necessary to the comfort of, say, 200 men from some European
                                        port to Boston; and although some of the parties who
                                        furnished the means for this experiment were actively
                                        interested in aid of other plans for bringing over
                                        emigrants, skilled <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0198"
                                        />mechanics, for our factories and machine shops, &amp;c.,
                                        yet this scheme, represented by Mr. Allen in Europe, and
                                        myself in Boston, was intended and distinctly understood by
                                        all concerned to be for the sole purpose of facilitating the
                                        immigration of able-bodied men who wished to come here for
                                        the sole purpose of enlisting in the United States army.</p>
                                    <p>In April of this year about 213 men were forwarded by Mr.
                                        Allen from Hamburg, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Hull and
                                        Liverpool, in England, to Portland, Maine, and thence by
                                        railroad to Boston, there being no steamers carrying
                                        emigrants direct to Boston from any European ports. I
                                        herewith submit a copy of the contract under which these men
                                        agreed to come. They were tampered with on the passage by
                                        men who offered them large bounties, provided they would go
                                        with them and enter the southern confederate army; and
                                        others, known as runners and brokers in the recruiting
                                        service, offered them extra bounties and persuasive
                                        arguments to induce them to violate their agreement with Mr.
                                        Allen, and enlist in the State of Maine. Trusting as we did
                                        in their good faith, we made no special provision to guard
                                        against such influences, and the result was that we lost
                                        about one-quarter of our men, who got into the hands of the
                                        runners and brokers in Portland, Boston, and some from New
                                        York; thus also involving us in a heavy pecuniary loss, for
                                        the expenses were, from various causes, swollen to a very
                                        large sum over our estimates and expectations. About 60 of
                                        these men, notwithstanding all the adverse influences thus
                                        brought to bear upon them, eagerly volunteered into the 20th
                                        Massachusetts regiment, and were apparently well satisfied
                                        with the treatment they had received on our part. Soon after
                                        their transfer to Galloup’s island as enlisted soldiers,
                                        they were sought out by the same class of men who tampered
                                        with them before they enlisted, and were persuaded to make
                                        complaints that they had been cheated, &amp;c. They also
                                        were induced to complain of ill treatment by the United
                                        States authorities, &amp;c. Your excellency deemed it
                                        advisable, on my request, to appoint a commission to
                                        investigate and report upon the facts in the case as to
                                        whether these men had been fairly treated or not. I also
                                        requested an expression of opinion as to the propriety of
                                        continuing to encourage this class of emigration in the
                                        light of the experience thus granted. I beg to refer to the
                                        report of Messrs. Forbes, Reed, and Dalton, who constituted
                                        your commission, for information as to the result of this
                                        first experiment, so far as it may be necessary to determine
                                        whether the emigrants were fairly treated or not.</p>
                                    <p>Our experience taught us thus far that in any future
                                        operations, in order to insure success, we must charter
                                        vessels to be under our own control, not only that we might
                                        guard the men against the influences of secessionists, and
                                        runners and brokers, but also to secure to the men a
                                        comfortable passage; for although we had paid unusual sums
                                        of money to secure comforts for the 213 of the first
                                        experiment, we have reason to believe that they did not
                                        receive <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that we paid for, and
                                        which they would have received but for the coming in contact
                                        with avaricious influences not under our control to prevent.
                                        The result of the experiment, however, being nevertheless
                                        satisfactory, not only to the emigrants, but also to our
                                        citizens, larger means were provided, and three ships—one
                                        steamer and two sailing vessels—were chartered, which sailed
                                        from Antwerp direct for Boston, bringing in all over 900
                                        men, all of whom I have the most reliable means of knowing
                                        embarked at Antwerp at their own solicitations, and with the
                                        most distinct understanding that they wished to enlist in
                                        the United States army immediately on their arrival in
                                        Boston.</p>
                                    <p>They nearly all signed a document, a copy of which I herewith
                                        submit with a sample of a few of their signatures. The
                                        exceptions where this document was not signed were, as I am
                                        informed by Mr. Allen, as well as by the men themselves,
                                        simply by accidental omission. On the arrival of the men in
                                        Boston harbor, having been warned in various ways that a
                                        strenuous and determined effort would be made to induce them
                                        to violate their agreement with us, we determined <pb
                                            n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0199"/>to guard against
                                        such influences if possible, and accordingly, at great
                                        expense, we provided barracks on Deer island for their
                                        reception and accommodation. This island being owned by the
                                        city of Boston, and nearly all occupied by schools,
                                        hospitals, and industrial institutions, we only obtained
                                        permission from the directors of those institutions to
                                        occupy any portion of the island on condition that we would
                                        procure from the city authorities a police force sufficient
                                        to protect the island from persons who would, from curiosity
                                        or otherwise, be inclined to assemble there, and thus
                                        disturb the institutions and injure the gardens and
                                        cultivated fields about the institutions, and also to
                                        prevent our emigrants from rambling over the premises
                                        devoted to the institutions. Such a police force was granted
                                        by the city authorities, and was present on the island when
                                        the emigrants were landed, and was there for the sole
                                        purposes above named, and for no other purpose. It may be
                                        proper here to remark, that so far as the emigrants
                                        themselves were concerned, the only precaution found by
                                        experience to be necessary on our part was to see that no
                                        unnecessary delay should exist in facilitating the
                                        enlistment. They were impatient to enlist, and the least
                                        delay which they could not see the necessity for caused them
                                        to feel a distrust, and fear that there might be a failure
                                            <hi rend="italic">on our part</hi> to enable them to do
                                        so.</p>
                                    <p>The point to which I wish to call attention is, that all
                                        their enlistment contracts were made voluntarily by
                                        themselves after their arrival here. Upon arrival each one
                                        was free to enlist or not, as he should choose. So far as we
                                        were concerned, we had simply advanced a large sum of money,
                                        and incurred an extraordinary risk, based simply on their
                                        verbally expressed desire to enlist after they should arrive
                                        here, they having executed papers binding themselves to
                                        transfer their bounties to us provided they should enlist,
                                        in order to reimburse our outlay for their transportation
                                        and expense. The bargain with the men was simply a civil
                                        contract with Julian Allen to procure them a free passage to
                                        the United States at all events, and then to pay them $100
                                        after entering into such employment as I should designate,
                                        which they understood, as well as I did, would be that of a
                                        soldier. We did not seek to make a contract <hi
                                            rend="italic">binding them to enlist.</hi> We trusted to
                                        their honor and to our knowledge that they had no desire to
                                        do otherwise than enlist; and, therefore, when the men were
                                        landed on Deer island, they then and there voluntarily, by
                                        their words and acts, did enlist, free from all exercise of
                                        force or compulsion.</p>
                                    <p>To this disposition on the part of the emigrants to carry out
                                        voluntarily and in every respect the spirit and intent of
                                        the agreement with Mr. Allen there were a few exceptions.
                                        One man who came on the steamer Bellona acknowledged that he
                                        was naturally a coward and feared to enter the army. He
                                        offered himself, however, to the surgeon for examination,
                                        and was accepted as sound in body; but when he came to be
                                        mustered and to take the oath of allegiance his courage
                                        failed. Some two or three others made evasive excuses for
                                        not enlisting, until it became evident that they were
                                        dishonest men who did not intend to carry out in good faith
                                        their understanding with Mr. Allen. As soon as this was
                                        ascertained, we gave them to understand that they were at
                                        liberty to leave our premises in freedom to go where they
                                        chose; and even under these circumstances, notwithstanding
                                        their dishonesty, we provided them with the means of
                                        immediate support, not being willing that they should be a
                                        burden on the community. One of the sailing vessels had on
                                        board 27 men, who, as it subsequently appeared, came here
                                        under the influence of a dishonest man who had formerly
                                        lived in New York, and who, under pretence of coining here
                                        to enlist in the army, got on board at Antwerp and induced
                                        these 27 men to refuse to land on Deer island. As we had no
                                        disposition, or right, or power, to force these men to
                                        enlist, we thereupon adopted what seemed to be the wisest
                                        expedient of getting rid of them, which was to pay their
                                        passage to New York, where they wished to go. All the rest
                                        of the men voluntarily landed and eagerly enlisted, with the
                                        exception above named; those who, from physical <pb n="180"
                                            xml:id="pg_180" facs="0200"/>infirmities, were rejected
                                        by the surgeons, being greatly disappointed. These were
                                        provided with employment immediately, or were given means to
                                        go to New York or elsewhere, according to their expressed
                                        wishes.</p>
                                    <p>As to the charges made by the Swiss complainants (if they are
                                        a part of the men who came here consigned to my care) that
                                        they were enlisted by force, &amp;c. I know of no other way
                                        than by simply saying that it is all a mere fabricatione
                                        without having the slightest foundation in truth; and I
                                        desire to say in conclusion, as comprehending the point and
                                        gist of the whole matter, that there was no compulsion of
                                        any kind whatsoever exercised over any man brought by us
                                        from Europe; but that the enlistment of each such man, upon
                                        his arrival here, was voluntarily and of his own free
                                        choice; and that each such man, upon his arrival here, was
                                        absolutely and completely free from any physical, legal, or
                                        other restraint whatsoever, as to whether he should or
                                        should not so enlist.</p>
                                    <p>If there should be a necessity to procure other evidence
                                        beyond my own statement, I would advise that the evidence of
                                        the United States enlisting officers and paymasters who were
                                        present on Deer island should be obtained. Several of our
                                        citizens were also present, assisting in the business of
                                        enlisting the men. Everything was done openly and
                                        aboveboard, and the men being all cheerful and constantly
                                        animating and cheering all present by their manifestations
                                        of happiness on having their condition changed from what it
                                        had been to that of a United States soldier. I will make no
                                        comment upon what the Swiss complainants say about what they
                                        caused to be published in the newspapers, except that I will
                                        say that I never saw the article which they state they
                                        published, nor did I know that such a newspaper existed; and
                                        as for my replying and calling them paupers, &amp;c., I have
                                        never, either directly or indirectly, made any communication
                                        whatever through the newspapers about these men in any shape
                                        or form.</p>
                                    <p>I presume these men have been told by bad men having some
                                        selfish end in view that such had been my action. The fact
                                        is, that were it necessary or could any good result from it,
                                        many things might be related in this report detailing the
                                        means that have been resorted to by bad men to make these
                                        emigrants discontented with the lot of their free
                                        choice.</p>
                                    <p>Having thus given a general outline of facts which will
                                        enable the authorities at Washington to judge whether it is
                                        likely that any wrong has been done towards the Swiss or
                                        not, I submit what I have said with respect, and will be
                                        most happy to furnish any other facts within my power,
                                        should they be called for.</p>
                                    <p>I have the honor to remain your excellency’s obedient
                                        servant,</p>

                                        reserve corps, commanding United States draft rendezvous at
                                        Galloup’s island, that certain German recruits for the 20th
                                        Massachusetts volunteer infantry “have been wronged.”</p>
                                    <p>2. A letter of M. D. Ross, esq., in answer to a copy of
                                        Lieutenant Colonel Johnson’s complaint, which I transmitted
                                        to him.</p>

                                        Mr. Ross requests, and will report to me on the whole
                                        subject: 1st. As to whether any wrong has been done; and if
                                        so, as to what measure of redress is due from me. 2d. As to

                                        recruits to Massachusetts. 3d. As to any action which I can

                                        that we have carefully read the communications submitted to
                                        us relating to the alleged complaints as to the enlistment
                                        of certain German recruits now in the 20th Massachusetts
                                        volunteer regiment, namely, a letter from Lieutenant Colonel
                                        Johnston, and a letter from M. D. Ross, esq., and other
                                        papers.</p>
                                    <p>Also, that Colonel Johnston has politely met us, and freely
                                        informed us of what knowledge he had upon the subject, as
                                        well as Lieutenant Magnitsky, an intelligent German officer
                                        in 20th Massachusetts volunteers, who has made himself
                                        personally familiar with the feelings of the aforesaid
                                        emigrants; also, Dr. B. Joy Jeffries, examining surgeon of
                                        said recruits, who has freely conversed with all the men in
                                        their own tongue; also, Messrs. Ross and Brown.</p>
                                    <p>We have examined various original contracts and assignments
                                        of bounties and other papers, and believe we have enjoyed
                                        ample opportunities for arriving at a just opinion in the
                                        premises.</p>
                                    <p>In reply to query 1, “as to whether any wrong has been done,
                                        and if so, as to what measure of redress is due from me,” we
                                        have to reply that we believe no wrong has been done; but,
                                        on the contrary, we have convincing evidence that Mr. Ross
                                        and associates have much more than fulfilled their
                                        obligations to the men, in which Colonel Johnston fully
                                        concurs after examining the facts.</p>
                                    <p>Query 2, “as to the expediency of Mr. Ross’s plan of bringing
                                        more Germans to Massachusetts,” we are of the opinion that
                                        the plan pursued by Mr. Ross, or any similar one, for
                                        facilitating the emigration of able-bodied men, will result
                                        to the mutual advantage of the emigrant and the
                                        Commonwealth, and advise that it be allowed to continue.</p>
                                    <p>Query 3, “as to any action which I can properly take to
                                        encourage it,” we recommend that Mr. Ross and associates
                                        receive all aid, encouragement, and protection, so far as
                                        you can lawfully extend it, upon evidence that they will
                                        faithfully perform their part of such contract as they make,
                                        and that the emigrants themselves are carefully informed of
                                        their own obligations previous to leaving their homes.</p>
                                    <p>We beg to add that we believe your excellency need entertain
                                        no anxiety in regard to the actual experiences of the men in
                                        question, as, from all the evidence we have had before us,
                                        we assure you that we believe the men were satisfied with
                                        their treatment up to the time of their arrival at Galloup’s
                                        island, and that <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0202"

                                        by the intermeddling of interested parties, who, in our
                                        judgment, are unworthy of further consideration. Finally, we
                                        have reason to believe that the men in question, in addition
                                        to a free and comfortable passage to this country, have
                                        received a larger pecuniary consideration than many of their

                                        reference to my letters to you of November 4 and of the
                                        present date, with regard to certain emigrants brought to
                                        Boston by Messrs. Allen and Ross, as covering all the points
                                        in the cases in question.</p>
                                    <p>I am satisfied, on investigation, that the enlistments of all
                                        the men in question were voluntary, and that any allegations
                                        of force being employed toward them to induce them to enlist
                                        are untrue; and I do not discover any evidence of any fraud

                                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In your number of the 13th
                                            of October you reproduced an article from the Courier
                                            des Etats-Unis containing a letter dated at New York,
                                            September 20, and signed by four emigrants, who
                                            complained bitterly of having been induced by my
                                            solicitations to quit Belgium for the United States of
                                            America. These emigrants say that I made them false
                                            promises; that they emigrated expecting to engage in
                                            civil occupations there, and not to enlist as soldiers;
                                            that they have been treated like dogs; and, finally,
                                            that they were turned loose in a foreign city, having
                                            been presented with only one shirt and $7.</p>
                                        <p>On October 14, accepting as veracious these allegations
                                            of the Courier des Etats-Unis, you denounce me as a
                                            “dealer in human flesh,” and you say that I have
                                            “seduced away from their families many hundreds of young
                                            men, who have been led to the shambles like a herd of
                                            slaves,” and you call the attention of the public
                                            authorities to the pretended facts which you lay to my
                                            charge.</p>
                                        <p>On October 16, instead of publishing the answer which I
                                            addressed to you, you insert only four lines of it, and
                                            you declare that you adhere to the version of the
                                            Courier des Etats-Unis, for the reason that it is in a
                                            better position than you “to appreciate the value of the
                                            complaints of which it has made itself the organ.”</p>
                                        <p>Finally, on October 18 you reproduced an article from the
                                            Organne des Mons, which pretends to have knowledge of a
                                            pretended despatch from our consul at New York, saying
                                            that the Belgian laborers who have found work in the
                                            American mining districts earn no larger wages than at
                                            home, and impugning my authority to represent American
                                            companies.</p>
                                        <p>I find myself, therefore, obliged to reply to your four
                                            articles in one response and to summon you, this time by
                                            an officer of the law, to give insertion to my
                                            reply.</p>
                                        <p>There is, sir, one powerful reason which should have made
                                            you suspicious of the veracity of the allegations
                                            contained in the Courier des Etats-Unis. You are well
                                            aware that this Bonapartist and pro-slavery journal
                                            makes war to the knife against the government of the
                                            United States, and that the approach of the presidential
                                            election has redoubled the violence of the attacks of
                                            this partisan of the south against the defenders of the
                                            Union, whom it calls the “republican butchers of the
                                            north.” Nor are you less aware, sir, that political
                                            parties in the United States, as in Belgium, are only
                                            too often too careless of the morality of the means by
                                            aid of which they hope to triumph over their
                                            adversaries. What would you say if in foreign countries
                                            one should assume as literally true the accusations
                                            which certain Belgian newspapers sometimes prefer
                                            against the government of our country?</p>
                                        <p>But however that may be, it is to me, in my capacity of
                                            agent of the bureau of emigration, No. 2 Rue de Brabant,
                                            Brussels, that the accusations of which your journal and
                                            certain others have made themselves echoes do especial
                                            outrage, and against me that they are especially
                                            directed. And they being so directed, since you have
                                            invoked the attention of the public authorities to them,
                                            I have been expecting that the subject would be made
                                            matter of judicial investigation. I regret having now to
                                            recognize that your denunciations have not been followed
                                            up in that manner, and that no prosecution has been
                                            initiated against me; for thereby I have missed an
                                            opportunity to establish by legal proofs that my conduct
                                            has been no other than honorable and loyal. But if it is
                                            true that the laws of my country have in no way been
                                            offended by me, the denunciations of the press remain
                                            none the less prejudicial to public opinion, and I value
                                            too much the esteem of my fellow-citizens not to regard
                                            it as a duty to disprove those denunciations to their
                                            satisfaction. For that purpose a bare statement of the
                                            facts is quite sufficient.</p>

                                        <p>Since I returned from the United States in June, 1863, I
                                            have been engaged in two distinct enterprises of
                                            emigration from Belgium.</p>
                                        <p>The object of the first was to engage artisans for civil
                                            labor in the United States, and especially miners for
                                            the mines in the State of Illinois. In this enterprise I
                                            acted as agent of various American corporations, and,
                                            among others, of those who work the most important oil
                                            mines of the western States.</p>
                                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
                                        <p>The second enterprise of emigration in which I have
                                            co-operated commenced during the month of July, 1864,
                                            and was completed on September 7. It had for its purpose
                                            to facilitate the transportation of Belgians desirous to
                                            enlist in the military service of the United States; and
                                            it was for this enterprise that I opened the bureau of
                                            emigration, No. 2 Rue de Brabant.</p>
                                        <p>In this connexion, sir, I have to answer to the
                                            accusation of having deceived artisans by engaging them
                                            to emigrate to the United States for the purpose of
                                            subjecting them to military service there, while leading
                                            them to believe that they were emigrating to find there
                                            civil employment. That is an odious accusation. Before
                                            entertaining it, good faith should have required some
                                            support of it by proofs. And it is a lying accusation.
                                            To not one single emigrant who addressed himself to me
                                            since the establishment of my bureau in the Rue de
                                            Brabant, did I promise civil employment. Every single
                                            one who quitted Belgium emigrated with the intention of
                                            entering the military service of the United States, and
                                            with that intention and for that purpose solely. Every
                                            single one knew that he would not be able to obtain the
                                            promised bounty of $100, and receive the monthly pay of
                                            $12, and be clothed free of expense to himself for three
                                            years, except by enlisting as a soldier.</p>
                                        <p>I affirm this positively, sir, and I challenge the
                                            presentation of the slightest proof to the contrary. I
                                            further insert, in this connexion, a copy of the
                                            circular which I addressed to most of the burgomasters
                                            of Belgium a little while after the opening of my
                                            bureau, and before the departure of the ships which
                                            transported the emigrants alluded to by the Courier des

                                            newspaper of August 2:</p>
                                        <p>“Eight hundred <hi rend="italic">volunteers,</hi>
                                            emigrants between the ages of 21 and 40 years, can find

                                            service, before August 6, at the office of L. A. Dochez,
                                            No. 2 Rue de Brabant, Brussels.”</p>
                                        <p>Finally, I offer to prove that at the time of the sailing
                                            of the ships from Antwerp the conditions announced in my
                                            circular to the burgomasters were again publicly
                                            repeated to the emigrants, and that a boat was placed at
                                            the disposition of such as should manifest a desire to
                                            remain in Belgium.</p>
                                        <p>And further, what need had I to make use of any artifice?
                                            What reason was there why I should resort to fraud for
                                            these enlistments?</p>
                                        <p>Is the enlistment of Belgians for service in foreign
                                            countries prohibited? Has not our own government, for
                                            the last six moths, been encouraging the organization of
                                            a body of troops for such service?</p>
                                        <p>At the same time with my advertisement, your newspaper
                                            was publishing that of General Chapelié calling for
                                            volunteers for the war in Mexico. And, moreover, it is
                                            not proper to speak of these as enlistments made by me.
                                            No contract of enlistment was signed on Belgian soil. I
                                            had no power for that purpose.</p>
                                        <p>On arrival in the United States these emigrants were
                                            perfectly free to enlist or not. Most of them did
                                            enlist, and received the bounty of one hundred dollars.
                                            Some were unwilling to enlist, and among such were those
                                            who, if one can believe the Courier des Etats-Unis,
                                            complain of not having received the bounty, or the
                                            military uniform, or the other advantages promised. Is
                                            not such a complaint absurd? How would it have been
                                            possible for the persons of whom I was the agent to
                                            furnish gratuitously transportation and subsistence to
                                            the United States, and to pay a bounty of $100 to each
                                            of these emigrants, if they, refusing to carry out an
                                            agreement voluntarily entered into by themselves, should
                                            fail to fulfil the condition which constituted the basis
                                            for such bounty?</p>
                                        <p>The enterprise, sir, in which the persons of whom I was
                                            the agent were engaged, was simply an enterprise of
                                            transportation; and it derived a legitimate remuneration
                                            of its expenses by assignment of a portion of the bounty
                                            paid by the United States to recruits. Neither the
                                            government of Belgium, nor that of the United States,
                                            had any concern whatsoever with it. Neither one nor the
                                            other had any right to meddle with it. We should have
                                            formally protested against any such intermeddling. All
                                            that was obligatory upon us was that, in our
                                            transactions, we should conform to the laws.</p>
                                        <p>Although this enterprise was wholly unofficial in its
                                            character, there is no feature of it which any one
                                            concerned in it has any reason to conceal from public
                                            investigation and criticism. If we had reason to expect
                                            personal profit from it, it was of profit equally to the
                                            emigrants, to Belgium, and to the United States. The
                                            cause in behalf of which I have aided these Belgians to
                                            enlist is the cause of the Union against rebels who seek
                                            to destroy it. You may have of this cause whatever
                                            opinion you please. For myself, I consider it the cause
                                            of order and of civilization. Certain Europeans,
                                            belonging to a family illustrious in history and
                                            endeared to your affections, have held it an honor to
                                            serve in its behalf. What would you say, sir, if
                                            Antwerp, for example, should undertake to secede from
                                            the rest of Belgium, under the pretext that laws had
                                            been passed which the citizens of Antwerp did not like?
                                            That is the precise point of view, both moral and
                                            political, of this question.</p>
                                        <p>As for the personal interest of the emigrants, tell me, I
                                            beg you, sir, if there <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186"
                                                facs="0206"/>are many countries which pay to
                                            volunteers, besides the original bounty on enlistment,
                                            $12 per month, besides subsistence, quarters, and
                                            clothing? Undoubtedly those who enlist in the federal
                                            army incur great dangers. They take part in a serious
                                            and bloody war which may last a long while yet. All the
                                            world knows that. But is it exactly becoming for those
                                            who wish to embrace a military career to complain of
                                            being liable to fight?</p>
                                        <p>Finally, from the point of view of the interest of
                                            Belgium, I have to say that I have never solicited from
                                            our government any favor; that I have never deprived our
                                            army of the service of a single soldier; that most of
                                            the men who answered to my appeal, although able-bodied,
                                            were destitute of all pecuniary resources; that Dewit,
                                            one of the signers of the letter in the Courier des
                                            Etats-Unis, came out of the alms-house at Brussels; and
                                            that Stas, another signer of the same letter, came out
                                            of a similar establishment which exists at Mons.</p>
                                        <p>I will not enlarge upon this point, fearing, sir, to have
                                            already presented a superfluity of proofs.</p>
                                        <p>It remains for me to allude to the complaints of these
                                            four emigrants concerning the food furnished to them
                                            during the voyage. These complaints are entirely
                                            destitute of foundation. In reply to them, I have need
                                            only to remark that at Antwerp, as in the United States,
                                            there are regulations of law concerning the quantity and
                                            quality of the food furnished to emigrants on their
                                            passage, and that the public authorities superintend
                                            rigorously the execution of these regulations.</p>
                                        <p>While requesting you to insert this communication in the
                                            next number of your journal, I ask those other
                                            newspapers, which have reproduced the calumnies of the
                                            Courier des Etats-Unis, to give insertion also to this
                                            reply.</p>
                                        <p>Accept, sir, the assurance of my distinguished
                                            consideration.</p>

                                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report the
                                        action taken by this bureau in the case presented by Baron
                                        Von Grabow, chargé d’affaires of Prussia, in his note of
                                        September 11, 1864, in relation to the enlistment of certain
                                        German emigrants at Boston, Massachusetts, in which it was
                                        alleged that “numerous emigrants, who had just come from
                                        Germany to devote themselves to the ordinary agricultural
                                        and manufacturing occupations, have been turned aside from
                                        the object or their voyage by being transferred to an island
                                        in the port of Boston, where, under the allurements of $100,
                                        promised in gold, but paid in paper, they have been managed
                                        to be enlisted in the army;” and also calling attention to
                                        the fact that another “vessel, having on board other
                                        emigrants, is momentarily expected in the bay of Boston, and
                                        that everything leads to the belief that the same process
                                        will be followed in regard to (them as to) those who are
                                        already in great part, at this time, in the military service
                                        of the United States,” and which was by you referred to this
                                        bureau on the 26th day of September last.</p>
                                    <p>On the same day the case was by me referred to Major F. N.
                                        Clarke, acting assistant provost marshal general of
                                        Massachusetts, with instructions to appoint a suitable
                                        person to watch the arrival of the expected vessel; and if,
                                        upon investigation, it were found that the abuses complained
                                        of were attempted, to take proper measures to prevent the
                                        same, and to report the facts to this office.</p>
                                    <p>On the 15th day of October Major Clarke reported, (a copy of
                                        which report is herewith transmitted,) including copy of a
                                        contract between Julian Allen and the emigrants referred to
                                        in the former part of the note of Baron Von Grabow, of
                                        September 11, wherein the emigrants agreed to go to any part
                                        of the United States, and, upon arrival there, to enter into
                                        any engagement with said Allen or his agents, for a period
                                        not exceeding three years, to serve in any employment which
                                        M. D. Ross, of Boston, or his agents might designate,
                                        provided the same was not in contravention of the laws of
                                        the United States. (A copy of which contract is respectfully
                                        enclosed, marked “A.”) Also enclosing a report of Captain W.
                                        G. Howe, mustering officer, who Blustered these persons into
                                        the service, in which it is stated that the nature of their
                                        enlistment and muster was explained to them in English,
                                        French, and German, and that they fully understood the
                                        obligations which they assumed, and that they expressed
                                        themselves, with but one exception, as being satisfied
                                        therewith, (a copy of which report is enclosed, marked
                                        “B.”)</p>
                                    <p>On the 20th day of October the report of Major Clarke was
                                        returned to him with the following indorsement:</p>
                                    <p>“Respectfully referred to Major F. N. Clarke, A. A. P. M. G.,
                                        at Boston, Massachusetts, with instructions to report to
                                        this office whether any officer of this bureau had been in
                                        any manner connected with, or has recognized the existence
                                        of, the within contract, in connexion with official duty;
                                        whether any recruiting officer or any mustering officer, or
                                        other officer of this bureau, has at any time in any manner
                                        recognized Julian Allen or M. D. Ross as the agent of any
                                        German or French recruits; whether any government bounty has
                                        been paid to Allen or Ross on account of enlistment of these
                                        aliens; and if so, by whom, and the amount; whether local
                                        bounties on account of these enlistments have been paid to
                                        Allen or Ross; and if so, how much; and whether any bounty
                                        has been paid to Allen or Ross that has not been paid over
                                        to these recruits.”</p>
                                    <p>Which was again forwarded by Major Clarke to this office with
                                        the following statement, dated October 24:</p>
                                    <p>“In connexion with the accompanying papers, I have the honor
                                        to report that no officer under my control has been in any
                                        manner connected with or recognized the existence of the
                                        contract in connexion with official duty.</p>
                                    <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0208"/>
                                    <p>“The mustering and disbursing officers have discharged their
                                        duties in the same manner as for other recruits, and the
                                        first instalment of the United States bounty paid as usual
                                        by Captain Dryer, disbursing officer, to the recruits
                                        themselves, and neither Mr. Allen nor Ross recognized
                                        officially in the matter. Mr. Allen has been in Europe, I
                                        believe, until recently, and until I saw the contract last
                                        month, Mr. Ross had only been known to me as an alderman of
                                        the city, and interested in obtaining recruits.</p>
                                    <p>“These men have been enlisted for the city of Boston, and the
                                        ordinance granting a bounty of $125 reads <hi rend="italic"
                                            >to</hi> or <hi rend="italic">for</hi> the recruit, and
                                        is generally given for the recruit. This is the case also
                                        with the town bounties. The towns obtain their men through
                                        recruiting agents or brokers, with whom they bargain to put
                                        in to the credit of the town so many men at a stated price
                                        per head. The broker then receives whatever the town pays,
                                        and makes his own arrangement with the recruit. Hence the
                                        villany practiced, and hence the necessity I have frequently
                                        been under of obtaining depositions from the recruits that
                                        they have been promised a given amount from these brokers
                                        and failed to receive it. Whenever such brokers could be
                                        found, they have been arrested and made by me to disgorge
                                        the promised amount. Efforts to this end are made also by
                                        the mustering-in officers, that the recruits shall, when
                                        sworn in, be satisfied. The city bounty of $125 has
                                        doubtless been paid <hi rend="italic">for</hi> these German
                                        recruits to Mr. Ross, or others; and I understand from
                                        Captain Dryer that they (the Germans) gave a signed order on
                                        the State authorities for the $325 the State has been
                                        paying. Whether such order has been recognized and the
                                        amount paid to Mr. Ross, or others, can only be determined
                                        by reference to the State authorities.</p>
                                    <p>“The United States bounty remaining unpaid ($200) will, of
                                        course, as it becomes due, go to the recruit.”</p>
                                    <p>On the 29th of October, a communication on this subject was
                                        addressed to his excellency the governor of the State of
                                        Massachusetts, informing him that proper steps would be
                                        taken by this bureau to see that the full amount of
                                        government bounties to which these recruits are entitled
                                        would be paid to them the same as other recruits, and
                                        referring the question of local bounties to his excellency,
                                        to which communication no reply has yet been received. A
                                        reply of the letter to his excellency Governor Andrew is
                                        herewith respectfully enclosed.</p>
                                    <p>In reply to the suggestion contained in the note of Baron Von
                                        Grabow, of the 25th ultimo, that on one side a Prussian
                                        agent, and on the other the provost marshal of the United
                                        States, should be enabled to make known to those arriving
                                        the conditions by aid whereof they can enlist in the army
                                        and obtain the emoluments consequent thereon, I beg leave to
                                        say that provost marshals and mustering officers are
                                        instructed to make known to all recruits the conditions
                                        under which they are accepted into the United States
                                        service, fully explaining to them the nature and
                                        responsibility which they assume, and the bounty, pay, and
                                        allowances which they are entitled to receive.</p>
                                    <p>Any agent of the Prussian government who desires it will at
                                        all times be permitted to be present at these musters, and
                                        be allowed to give such information touching the subject as
                                        he may deem necessary to acquaint these recruits with the
                                        conditions under which they enter the service of the United
                                        States.</p>
                                    <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient

                                        excepting 100 dollars in the currency of the United States,
                                        we agree to assign, and hereby do assign, to the aforesaid
                                        M. D. Ross, his agent, agents, or representative; and we

                                        papers which may be or become necessary to enable said M. D.
                                        Ross, his agent or representative, to procure any and all

                                        engaging into any service or employment designated by said
                                        M. D. Ross, his agent, agents, or representative, for the
                                        period of time aforenamed.</p>
                                    <p>It has been clearly explained, and is as clearly understood
                                        by us, that there are extraordinary risks incurred by Mr.
                                        Julian Allen in assuming, as he does, to give us a free
                                        passage to the United States of America, and then, on our
                                        arrival there, to procure for us remunetive employment; and
                                        therefore we, by our own free will and choice, agree to make
                                        the assignment as aforenamed of all bounties or extra
                                        moneys, (excepting the 100 dollars.) We here acknowledge
                                        that through the agency of Mr. Julian Allen and his
                                        associates, our condition in life will be sufficiently
                                        improved to make it just and right that Mr. Allen and his
                                        associates shall make a profit in the transaction of their
                                        business of forwarding us.</p>

                                        reply to your inquiries about the men brought over by
                                        Messrs. M. D. Ross and others from Europe, that I was at the
                                        island with each load as a mustering officer, and that they
                                        left the following impression on me as on others with whom I
                                        conversed on the subject, viz:</p>
                                    <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0210"/>
                                    <p>1st. That they perfectly understood what they were doing when
                                        the oath was administered to them, which, so as to give no
                                        chance for a mistake, was explained to them in French and
                                        German as well as English.</p>
                                    <p>2d. That they were not only perfectly satisfied to go, but
                                        were anxious to do so, which was shown, when passed by the
                                        surgeon and ready for the boat, by their songs, cheers,
                                        &amp;c.; and when one was rejected, by his sorrowful face
                                        and commiserations of his comrades.</p>
                                    <p>3d. They were all satisfied with the money paid them, with
                                        one exception, where the man wanted to be paid in gold
                                        instead of currency.</p>
                                    <p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                                        enclose a copy of contract made by Mr. Julian Allen, the
                                        agent of the parties concerned, and the Germans or other
                                        aliens who have been enlisted or entered the service of the
                                        United States; also the letter of Captain Howe, provost
                                        marshal fourth district, who mustered in most of these men.
                                        When it is taken into consideration that these men have been
                                        transported across the water, that the men have voluntarily
                                        entered the engagement, that the usual risks incident to a
                                        voyage have been incurred which might have involved the
                                        projectors of the scheme in pecuniary loss, it is difficult
                                        to determine that the probable profits accruing from its
                                        successful accomplishment are evidence of unfairness towards
                                        such emigrants. That the parties of the first part have made
                                        money in the operation I suppose there is no doubt. In
                                        answer to this, it is said, have we not incurred
                                        corresponding risks, which might have made our attempt one
                                        of great pecuniary loss? From all I can possibly ascertain
                                        the contract has been fulfilled. The United States bounty
                                        has been paid to the men as in other cases; but, in final
                                        settlement with the men, in view of their assignment to M.
                                        D. Ross of all bounties or extra moneys, the amount paid by
                                        the United States has determined the balanee to be made good
                                        by Mr. Ross. To what extent advantage has been taken of the
                                        ignorance of these people is a question that every one
                                        answers for himself. In conversation the other day, a
                                        gentlemen connected with the Prussian consulate remarked
                                        that the contractors had made undoubtedly a large sum in the
                                        transaction, and that the emigrants had not received the
                                        bounties and advance that others had. In view of the
                                        contract, the expenses attending their shipment and
                                        transportation to this country, it is difficult, without
                                        understanding the personal hopes, expectations, and desires
                                        of these men with regard to reaching our own country, to
                                        draw any parallel in the two cases.</p>
                                    <p>I am happy to be able to inform you that there seems to be
                                        little or no prospect of a recurrence of such importation.
                                        In any event, I would respectfully <pb n="191"

                                        by us, that there are extraordinary risks and expenses
                                        incurred by Mr. Julian Allen in assuming, as he does, to
                                        give us a free passage to the United States of America, and
                                        then, on our arrival there, to procure for us remunerative
                                        employment; and therefore we, by our own free will and
                                        choice, agree to make, and do make, the assignment, as above
                                        named, of all bounties or extra moneys, (excepting the
                                        $100.) We here acknowledge, that through the agency of Mr.

                                        be sufficiently improved to make it just and right that Mr.

                                        remuneration in the transaction of their business in
                                        forwarding us, so as to defray their expenses, should it

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I received a call a few days since from
                            Sir Frederick Bruce, late the British minister in China. I deem it but
                            an act of justice to say to you that he expressed the kindest feelings
                            towards Mr. Burlingame, our minister in that country. He says he has
                            been of much service there—has acted on all proper <pb n="195"
                                xml:id="pg_195" facs="0215"/>occasions in concert with his fellow
                            diplomatists, and has in all respects made himself acceptable to those
                            gentlemen with whom he was officially connected in that country. Indeed,
                            Sir Frederick expressed himself with an unusual cordiality and respect
                            for Mr. Burlingame, and for his conduct in discharge of the duties of
                            his mission.</p>
                        <p>It is so rare that we have an opportunity of hearing so directly and from
                            such good authority of our ministers or agents in that distant country,
                            I have thought you would not consider it amiss if I should report to you
                            the favorable opinion so freely expressed by the representative of the
                            British government there.</p>

                        <p>The first three of these despatches are but the formal acknowledgments of
                            the reception of despatches from me not contemplating an answer, while
                            the last (694) is the usual military and political summary of recent
                            events. We are waiting with intense interest the arrival of the next
                            steamer in the hope that it will bring news enough of the election to
                            give an indication of the result.</p>
                        <p>The foreign press (English and French) both yet entertain a hope of the

                        <p>Mr. Herder always begs me to make his respects to you, of whom he speaks
                            most kindly. He says, although you did not agree exactly in your
                            opinions, yet your and his personal relations were most kind.</p>
                        <p>The new minister, M. Chateau Renard, has not yet come to Paris. He is at

                            of a correspondence which has just taken place between Mr. Geofroy and
                            this department. <note n="*" xml:id="d238fn1">See correspondence with
                                the French legation.</note></p>
                        <p>You will perceive that in this correspondence I decline to discuss the
                            question, whether the President of Mexico, in his present reduced
                            situation, has, by the law of nations, a right to issue letters of
                            marque. I think the occasion a suitable one for bringing to the
                            consideration of the imperial government the fact that it has now for
                            three years and a half, against the constant protest of the United
                            States, recognized as a naval belligerent an insurrection in the United
                            States that has not only never had a recognized political existence, but
                            also has never had a port in our country. It would simplify affairs very
                            much, and contribute to the security of French as well as of American
                            commerce, if the government of France should apply to our civil strife
                            the principle it assumes in regard to Mexico, namely: that a military
                            force, which is destitute of ports or ships-of-war, cannot rightly be
                            deemed a naval belligerent.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In the years 1862 and 1863
                                remonstrances were addressed by us to the government of Brazil
                                against its policy, different as it was from all other American
                                States in regard to the furnishing of shelter and a haven to pirates
                                who were engaged in depredating upon the peaceful commerce of the
                                United States. The correspondence came to a close without having
                                produced any satisfactory result, and not without leaving a painful
                                presentiment that a continuance of measures so injurious to the
                                United States would sooner or later affect the harmonious relations
                                heretofore existing between the two countries.</p>
                            <p>We have just now heard of the capture of the Florida by the
                                Wachusett, at Bahia, and of the consequent hostilities adopted by
                                the Brazilian forces in that port, but we have no particular
                                information of the circumstances which preceded the collision, and
                                our information concerning the transaction itself is incomplete. At
                                the same time we are absolutely without knowledge of any
                                correspondence that it may have elicited between yourself and the
                                Brazilian government.</p>
                            <p>In this stage of the matter the President thinks it proper that you
                                should inform the minister for foreign affairs that we are not
                                indisposed to examine the subject upon its merits carefully, and to
                                consider whatever questions may arise out of it in a becoming and
                                friendly spirit, if that spirit shall be adopted by his Imperial

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The undersigned has the honor to show
                                to you, that he shipped, on the 26th October, last month, on board
                                the English schooner Allison, a certain lot of merchandise, destined
                                for Matamoras, Tamaulipas, Mexico.</p>
                            <p>That he obtained, on the 29th October past, a visa of his passport,
                                at the consular office for Matamoras, and that such visa was
                                recorded at the office of the provost marshal of the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>That, besides, he obtained a pass from the said provost marshal,
                                which authorized him to embark on the schooner Allison, on her
                                departure for Matamoras.</p>
                            <p>That the said schooner Allison was regularly cleared by the
                                custom-house of this city on the 28th of said month of October past,
                                for the port of Matamoras, Mexico.</p>
                            <p>That, despite compliance with all these formalities, the said
                                schooner was not allowed to leave the port of New Orleans, with her
                                cargo and passengers.</p>
                            <p>That the result of what precedes is, that the signer of this
                                statement is seriously injured in his interests, and finds himself
                                under the necessity of addressing the consulate of his country, and
                                to ask that justice and redress may be rendered to him.</p>
                            <p>That the forcible detention at this port of the schooner Allison, and
                                on the other hand of himself, causes to him serious injury, which he
                                estimates up to this day at the sum of six thousand dollars, besides
                                100 dollars per day for a longer forcible detention.</p>
                            <p>He has, in consequence of what precedes, the honor to beg the consul
                                of France at New Orleans to have the goodness to confirm his
                                reclamation, and to bring it to the knowledge of his excellency the
                                minister of his Imperial Majesty the Emperor, near the government of
                                the United Slates at Washington, D. C.</p>
                            <p>In this expectation, I have the honor to be, Mr. Consul, your most
                                humble and obedient servant,</p>

                            department for foreign affairs at Paris, for the purpose of obtaining
                            the liberation of his son, arbitrarily incorporated, as it would seem,

                                pleasure. I would tell you that I had hardly received your letter,
                                when I settled my account at the house where I was, and came back to
                                New York, where I staid some days, awaiting a vessel on which to
                                return to France, but meanwhile persons came looking for me, and
                                telling me I was a soldier, and that I must go, because my name had
                                been given at the hotel where I was staying without my knowing
                                anything about it, and told me that the chance had fallen on me.
                                There were two of us in this situation, and we were told we could
                                not be obliged to become soldiers, but We had no person to take care
                                of us, and meantime we were taken to an island in the neighborhood,
                                and gradually, a month afterwards, we were off the city of
                                Charleston, thoroughly enrolled in the regiment, and at the end of
                                some days were carrying on our backs the knapsack and musket.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: According to information which has reached
                            the Emperor’s government, three regiments of the federal army have
                            lately been sent to Matamoras under pretext of protecting the consul of
                            the United States at that point, and have there re-established the
                            Juarist authority, by driving out therefrom General Cortinas, who had
                            pronounced against it. This news, the official confirmation of which,
                            however, it had not received, has fixed the attention of the Emperor’s
                            government. Such a fact would constitute a violation of the neutrality,
                            on which the assurances of the cabinet at Washington have authorized it
                            to rely, on its part, in regard to Mexico, and would also be entirely
                            opposed to the instructions addressed by the Department of State to
                            General Banks, who has been directed to favor neither of the two
                            parties, and not to enter the Mexican territory, even to protect the
                            American consul and citizens there. I therefore deem it my duty, sir, to
                            point it out to you, and would be infinitely obliged if you could
                            furnish me with explanations on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Be pleased to accept, sir, assurances of my high consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 11th instant, in which you state that,
                            according to information which has reached the Emperor’s government,
                            three regiments of the United States army have lately been sent to
                            Matamoras under the pretext of protecting, the consul of the United
                            States at that port, and have there established the Juarist authority by
                            driving out therefrom General Cortinas, who had pronounced against it
                            there. You proceed in your note to observe that this news, the official
                            confirmation of which, however, had not been received by the French
                            government, has fixed the attention of the Emperor’s government. That
                            the alleged proceedings constituted a violation of the neutrality, on
                            which the assurances of this government has authorized France to rely,
                            and would also be opposed to the instructions which were addressed by
                            this department to Major General Banks, who commands the United States
                            forces on the borders of Mexico, and therefore you ask proper
                            explanation thereupon.</p>
                        <p>In reply to your note I have the honor to say that the attention of the
                            President was first directed to the transaction you have mentioned by a
                            note which was written to this department by Don Matias Romero, the
                            minister plenipotentiary of the Mexican republic residing at this
                            capital, on the sixth of February last. Mr. Romero, in that note,
                            represented that the dispute at Matamoras, which was the occasion of the
                            proceeding of General Herron, now complained of, was a dispute between
                            two military leaders, each of whom acknowledged the authority and acted
                            under the orders of the Mexican republic. Taking that view of the
                            subject, Mr. Romero insisted that the proceeding of General Herron was a
                            flagrant violation of Mexican sovereignty, as well as a violation of the
                            beforementioned instructions of this department to Major General
                            Banks.</p>
                        <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0222"/>
                        <p>Upon receiving these representations of Mr. Romero, I called upon the
                            Secretary of War for such information concerning this transaction as he
                            possessed, and further requested that a full investigation thereof might
                            he instituted. I have received from the Secretary of War certain papers
                            which bear upon the transaction in question, but not yet the full report
                            which has been requested. I have now the honor to place copies of these
                            papers before you, namely, a report of Major General Banks, with the
                            documents annexed, and to add to them an extract from a despatch of the
                            United States Consul at Matamoras, which has been received at this
                            department.</p>
                        <p>A declaration of the views of this government upon the proceeding of
                            General Herron is necessarily reserved until the result of the
                            investigation which has been ordered shall have been ascertained. I
                            shall be happy, in the mean time, to receive any information upon the
                            subject which the government of France shall find it convenient and
                            desirable to submit in support of the views of that government which
                            conflict with the representations of the Mexican government, as well as
                            with the statements made by the military authorities and the consul of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>I will add that General Banks has again been specially charged to do
                            whatever is practicable to avoid any collision between the forces under
                            his command and either of the belligerents in Mexico, and even to guard,
                            so far as may be possible, against suffering any occasion to arise for
                            dispute or controversy between his command or the authorities of Texas,
                            and either or both of these parties.</p>
                        <p>Accept, sir, the assurances of my high consideration.</p>

                                Brownsville, has sent troops into the city, of Matamoras, daring
                                local disturbances in that city, in violation of Mexican

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General</hi>: I enclose herewith my report
                                    in reference to sending troops to the other side of the river
                                    for the protection, of the United States consulate, and
                                    believing it will interest you, I add some; other facts in
                                    connexion with the matter.</p>
                                <p>Upon arriving here I found Lerna, established as governor of
                                    Tamaulipas, but Ruiz, who had been appointed military governor
                                    by Juarez, was moving on Matamoras with 600 men. Colonel
                                    Cortinas was in command of the Lerna forces. Arriving near the
                                    town, commissioners from the two parties met and settled the
                                    matter in this way: Lerna to retire to his ranche; Ruiz to take
                                    his seat as governor; the troops of both parties to unite under
                                    General Cassistran, a Ruiz man, with Cortinas as second in
                                    command, and to march against the French at Tampico. Lerna at
                                    once vacated. Ruiz took his seat, and the troops of both parties
                                    were camped in the town.</p>
                                <p>As near as I can learn the agreement was violated in several
                                    particulars by both parties, and considerable feeling was
                                    created. On the afternoon of the 12th, about 4 o’clock,
                                    Cardenas, an officer of Colonel Cortinas, rode to Governor
                                    Ruiz’s house and insulted him; was arrested by the guard,
                                    carried into a back yard and shot within half art hour. This
                                    settled the matter, and at 8 <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204"
                                        facs="0224"/>o’clock, the same evening, the parties opened
                                    on each other with artillery in the plaza.</p>
                                <p>The fight continued thoughout the night, and until 12 o’clock the
                                    next day. During the night, at times, the musketry was severe,
                                    and I should say 250 shots were fired with artillery. Mr. Pierce
                                    was satisfied that an attempt would be made to rob the
                                    consulate, and had great apprehension for his family. The
                                    governor having officially notified me that he could not protect
                                    him, and believing that I could remove him without complicating
                                    matters, I sent troops over, feeling satisfied that under the
                                    circumstances I was only doing my duty.</p>
                                <p>During the fight the town and the road leading to the ferry were
                                    filled with robbers doing a good business, and had Mr. Pierce
                                    attempted to cross without a guard he would have been robbed, if
                                    not murdered. Both parties are perfectly satisfied with my
                                    action, although Ruiz complained somewhat that I did not aid
                                    him, claiming that the Mexican troops once aided the citizens of
                                    Brownsville in repelling an attack of this same Cortinas.</p>
                                <p>I have the honor, to be, with great respect, your obedient
                                    servant,</p>

                                    following report of circumstances that transpired on the night
                                    of the 13th instant:</p>
                                <p>About 8 o’clock in the evening we were startled by rapid
                                    cannonading and musketry firing, evidently going on in the
                                    streets of Mataraoras, just across the Rio Grande, which
                                    continued without cessation, and spreading over the greater
                                    portion of the town until 10 o’clock.</p>
                                <p>At this hour I received the following communication from Mr. L.
                                    Pierce, jr., United States consul at Matamoras:</p>

                                <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">General</hi>: A battle is now raging in the
                                    streets of this city between the forces of Governor Manuel Ruiz
                                    and Colonel Juan N. Cortinas. My person and family are in great
                                    danger, as the road between here and the ferry is said to be
                                    infested with robbers. I have also about one million of dollars
                                    in specie, and a large amount of valuable property under my
                                    charge in the consulate, and, from the well-known character of
                                    Cortinas and his followers, I fear the city will be plundered. I
                                    therefore earnestly request that you will send a sufficient
                                    force to protect myself and property, and to transport the money
                                    within the limits of the United States at the earliest moment

                                <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The forces commanded by Colonel
                                    Cortinas have attacked my positions, in this place. As this town
                                    is very extensive, I cannot protect all, nor guarantee the

                                    citizens, of different nations, living in this town. For this
                                    reason I shall endeavor to repulse the enemy, and ask you the
                                    favor to send some troops over to guard and protect the said
                                    property, which it is impossible for me to protect.</p>

                                <p>I had, immediately after the firing commenced, despatched an
                                    officer (Colonel Black, 37th Illinois infantry,) to the United
                                    States consulate, with instructions to inform me at once of the
                                    condition of affairs, and hearing from him, also, that the road
                                    was infested with robbers, who were taking advantage of the
                                    lighting to rob and murder, and that the family of the consul
                                    could not get away without a guard, and the legal governor,
                                    recognized by President Juarez, having informed me officially
                                    that he could not protect him, I deemed it not inconsistent with
                                    my instructions to send a small force into the city of Matamoras
                                    for the purpose of removing the family of Mr. Pierce and the
                                    specie to this side of the river.</p>
                                <p>I therefore ordered Colonel Henry Bertram, 20th Wisconsin
                                    infantry, to send forty men to take charge of the ferry, to put
                                    one regiment under arms and call at my headquarters for further
                                    orders. Upon reporting, I instructed him to take four companies
                                    of his regiment across the river, and proceed to the United
                                    States consulate, and there to make proper disposition of his
                                    force to protect the United States consul and his property, and
                                    to remove them at the earliest possible time to this side of the
                                    river.</p>
                                <p>Instructing him, at the same time, in the most positive manner,
                                    not to interfere in the fight. I then replied to Governor Ruiz

                                    between your troops and those of Colonel Cortinas, and the

                                    States consul, I have ordered Colonel Bertram, with four
                                    companies of United States troops, to proceed to the house of
                                    Mr. Pierce at his request, for the sole and only purpose of
                                    conveying them within the territory of the United States. The
                                    dangers from assassins and robbers on the road between here and
                                    your city seem imperatively to demand this course, which I take
                                    reluctantly, with every assurance to you that I shall commit no
                                    hostile acts upon Mexican territory, nor interfere in any manner
                                    with the fight now going on in your city. I have instructed Mr.

                                <p>Colonel Bertram proceeded without delay to the other side of the
                                    river, marching by the shortest route to the consulate, and
                                    placing his troops within the yard which is attached to the
                                    house, and such arrangements were then made as would prevent any

                                    we appeared on the streets. The consul thinks Cortinas is

                                    sufficient time to remove his family and the valuables in the
                                    consulate to this side. Again let me state that you will
                                    interfere in no way with the fight, but keep your men at their
                                    posts for the duty assigned them. Send a good officer with the
                                    troops at the ferry, and issue the most positive orders
                                    prohibiting straggling from the ranks or interference of any
                                    nature whatever with either person or property. Should a stray
                                    shot come near or even strike one of your men, that will not be
                                    considered a sufficient reason for your firing. I have notified

                                    purpose. Should you see either of the persons named, state fully

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">“General</hi>: I have received your letter.
                                    Your instructions are strictly obeyed, and I have sent the most
                                    stringent orders to Lieutenant Colonel Laughlin not to allow
                                    anything to be done that could be construed into a violation of
                                    your orders. Commissions from both Ruiz’s and Cortinas’s parties
                                    have been here to inquire into the object of our corning over. I
                                    told them what my instructions were, and both parties went away
                                    satisfied. The consul says he has about one million in specie in
                                    his possession, and that he cannot possibly remove it or his
                                    family until morning, I have not been able to learn positively
                                    which party is gaining, Ruiz still holds the plaza, and I think
                                    will hold it until morning.</p>

                                <p>The fighting ceased for an hour after the appearance of my
                                    troops; but learning that there was to be no interference, both
                                    parties went at it again, taking care, however, to keep some
                                    distance from the United States consulate. Matters continued so
                                    until daylight, when I sent a sufficient number of wagons to
                                    remove the family of Mr. Pierce and property from the consulate.
                                    At 7 o’clock a. m. of the 13th they were safely landed on this
                                    side, and the troops withdrew. The fighting in the morning was
                                    carried on bitterly until 12 o’clock, when the Ruiz party
                                    retreated, and were scattered in every direction. The casualties
                                    on both sides were about fifty killed and one hundred wounded.
                                    Among the killed was ex-Governor Alveus Lopez, a prominent Ruiz
                                    man.</p>
                                <p>Governor Ruiz’s forces numbered 800 men and four pieces of
                                    artillery, while Cortinas’s force was 600 men and six pieces of
                                    artillery. Considerable damage was done by the artillery to the
                                    town during the fight, and by lawless bands plundering,
                                    &amp;c.</p>
                                <p>Colonel Cortinas has already announced himself as governor of
                                    Tamaulipas, while Governor Ruiz, General Rohez, and some other
                                    prominent officers, escaped and crossed to this side, and are
                                    now here refugees.</p>
                                <p>I have in this report given merely the facts in detail, and will
                                    not enter into any argument in justification of my course.
                                    Notified by the governor of the State that he could not protect
                                    the United States consulate, and with an appeal from the consul
                                    direct for protection for his family and property, I felt that
                                    it was unquestionably my duty to furnish a sufficient guard to
                                    remove him from the city, taking at the same time every
                                    precaution to prevent collision with either of the factions. I
                                    might here state that the English consul remained during the
                                    night at the United States consulate under our protection. * *
                                    *</p>
                                <p>In conclusion I would say that Colonel H. Bertram, of the 20th
                                    Wisconsin infantry, who commanded the troops that crossed over,
                                    performed the delicate mission in an admirable manner, and
                                    proved himself an officer of more than ordinary judgment. His
                                    officers and soldiers are entitled to thanks for their
                                    conduct.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since the arrival of the federal troops
                            (6th November) affairs on this side of the Rio Grande have been in a
                            most complete uproar. Immediately upon the arrival of troops at
                            Brownsville, General Cobos, the reaccionario, crossed over and with a
                            small force seized the governor (Ruiz) and other afficials and placed
                            them in confinement, making himself governor, R. Vila military
                            commander, and Colonel Juan N. Cortinas, who created a disturbance and
                            fight in Brownsville several years ago, second in command. After
                            reigning twenty-four hours, Cortinas discovered that Cobos and Vila were
                            endeavoring to get up a pronunciamiento in favor of the French, and he
                            accordingly ordered his men to take them out and shoot them, which was
                            done. Cortinas then proclaimed Jesus do la Lerna governor, and released
                            Ruiz from prison, giving him two hours in which to leave town, referring
                            the whole matter to the general government. In the mean time Ruiz went
                            off to the interior, and as Lerna had been the cause of the revolution
                            two years ago, Ruiz was sent back again to take his seat, with a large
                            escort of regular troops. Lerna, who had arrived in town, supported by
                            Cortinas, made preparations to defend the town, but after ten days’ talk
                            on the subject, on the first day of January it was agreed that Ruiz
                            should take the chair, and the troops of both parties should go to
                            Tampico to fight the French, and until they should be ready to start
                            Ruiz should hold one side of the town and Cortinas the other. Everything
                            remained quiet until the afternoon of the 12th, when Octiviano Cardenas,
                            who belonged to the Cortinas party, went to the palace in company with
                            two other officers and insulted the governor. In arresting him he fired
                            his pistol off among Ruiz’s soldiers. He was immediately seized, led
                            out, and shot to death. This again started a correspondence between the
                            contending parties, and at 9 p. m. the same evening the fighting
                            commenced in the streets, one party using six pieces of artillery and
                            Ruiz using two. The battle lasted until 11 a. m. on the 13th, when
                            Cortinas took possession of the palace and town, and Ruiz and his
                            friends fled to Brownsville, and at present we are without a
                            governor.</p>
                        <p>During the night of the 12th, finding that robbing was being carried on
                            in some parts of the town, and I having about a million of dollars in
                            specie under my charge, at 10½ p. m. I applied to Major General Herron,
                            commanding the forces on the Rio Grande, for sufficient men to protect
                            our property from thieves and robbers, and he immediately crossed over a
                            large force, who remained by us until morning, when I sent all the money
                            to Brownsville, and the troops retired. * * * * * * * *</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received the note you did me the
                            honor to write to me on the 12th of the month, with the various
                            documents which accompanied it.</p>
                        <p>It seems, by these papers, that on the 12th of January last, a battle
                            having <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0229"/>been commenced in the
                            city of Matamoras between the two Mexican chiefs, Ruiz and Cortinas, on
                            the application of Mr. Pierce, consul of the United States there
                            resident, who feared for his safety, Major General Herron, commanding
                            the federal troops cantoned at Brownsville, Texas, sent across the
                            frontier four companies of infantry, who came and took up a position in
                            the vicinity of the consulate, and there remained until next day, the
                            13th; that they took back with them to the other side of the river Mr.
                            Pierce, his family, and the valuables deposited at the consulate.</p>
                        <p>I remark that this temporary occupation had also been solicited by Ruiz,
                            chief of the Juarists, who wrote at the same time as Mr. Pierce to
                            General Herron, to declare to him that he was not in a condition to
                            protect the United States consulate and the property of American
                            citizens settled in the city, and who, under the pretence of providing
                            for the safety of foreigners, wished probably to get for himself the
                            support, at least apparent, of the federal troops.</p>
                        <p>On the morning of the 13th, when these were withdrawn, the Juarists
                            disbanded, and Ruiz, with his principal officers, also crossed the river
                            and took refuge at Brownsville.</p>
                        <p>In fine, it is evident it is General Banks whose charge it is to point it
                            out, that in taking possession of his command General Herron received a
                            communication of the instructions prepared the 23d of November, 1863, by
                            the Department of State, and that in consequence he acted, as also did
                            Consul Pierce, in full knowledge of the subject.</p>
                        <p>Such are the facts established by the reports of the military commanders
                            of the United States. It would be difficult not to recognize therein a
                            violation of neutrality, and a positive breach of orders, although so
                            clear, which had been given by the Department of State, precisely for
                            the accordance of such eventualities.</p>
                        <p>I shall carry your excellency’s note to the knowledge of the Emperor’s
                            government, and be prepared to transmit to it also the report of Major
                            General Banks, which you are pleased to announce to me, as well as all
                            other documents you may deem proper to complete the elucidation of the
                            affair.</p>

                            take the deposits of guano discovered on Swan islands, has addressed the
                            government of the Emperor for the purpose of obtaining special
                            privileges for the exportation of this manure to France.</p>
                        <p>Before coming to a decision, in this respect, the government of the
                            Emperor would desire to know whether the Swan islands have been
                            effectively and lawfully annexed to the United States. The petitioners
                            have brought to its notice a certificate from your excellency, dated
                            February 11, 1863, attesting that they had complied, in what regards
                            these islands, with the conditions required by the act of Congress of
                            April 18, 1856. But what is the meaning of that act? Does it simply
                            authorize the government of the United States to protect American
                            citizens who discover deposits of guano, or does it establish the
                            protection of the United States over the territory also?</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The rumor has been already some time
                            spread abroad that a fresh modification of the tariff was going to take
                            place, and that the question would be of enhancing still more the
                            duties, already very heavy, which strike particularly the productions of
                            French industry. The government of his Majesty, justly preoccupied by a
                            project through which the commerce of its people would mainly suffer,
                            has charged me to observe to your excellency that the importation to the
                            United States of our dried fruits, of our oils, of our alimentary
                            preserves, and of our brandies, as well as of our silks, has already
                            diminished under the burden of enhanced duties of customs which have
                            followed one another in years past, and that if new duties be added the
                            increased equivalent price will restrict more and more the consumption
                            in the American market, access to which would end by their being
                            interdicted.</p>
                        <p>These incessant augmentations of tariffs are not, besides, only injurious
                            to commerce from abroad—they tend moreover to compromise the interests
                            of the American treasury in place of serving them, for the importations,
                            which have already experienced a notable reduction, cannot diminish
                            still more without the receipts at the custom-houses diminishing
                            sensibly in a future close at hand. The result is already produced in a
                            remarkable manner in what concerns our brandies and our silks, and which
                            I would particularly indicate to your excellency. The importation of our
                            brandies in 1860 amounted at New York alone to 70,480 barrels; the last
                            year it was only 5,922, in consequence of the increase of duties, which
                            Congress raised from 30 to 100 per cent.</p>
                        <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0231"/>
                        <p>The diminution on silk goods has not been less heavy; the ribbons and
                            silk stuffs imported to the United States in 1860 were effectively worth
                            $35,382,037, while the silk goods imported in 1863 represented only a
                            value of $15,534,409.</p>
                        <p>Such figures are conclusive. I am gratified in the hope, sir, that the
                            federal government will take them into serious consideration, and will
                            oppose the pursuit of a system which is, perhaps, still more prejudicial
                            to its own interests than to our trade.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, sir, the assurances of my high consideration.</p>

                            company, which proposes to work the deposits of guano discovered on Swan

                            France, and inquiring whether the Swan islands have been effectively and
                            lawfully annexed to the United States, and whether the act of Congress
                            of the 18th of April, 1856, simply authorizes the government of the
                            United States to protect American citizens who discover deposits of
                            guano, or if it in fact establishes the protection of the United States

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As I have the honor to inform you, I have
                            transmitted to my government the documents which your excellency
                            submitted to me on the subject of the affair at Matamoras. The documents
                            can scarcely have reached Paris at this moment. While awaiting the
                            answer they will occasion, I this morning received a second despatch
                            from M. Drouyn de l’Huys, pointing to new facts, on which I shall have
                            the honor to confer with your excellency on the earliest day my health
                            will permit me to go out; but there is a point which seems to be of
                            importance to bring immediately to your notice. It would appear that on
                            the news of the events of the month of January last General Bazaine took
                            the measures necessary to protect, in the direction of Matamoras, the
                            Mexican territory against any further invasion. Whatever may be the
                            opinion we may form upon past events, you will comprehend, sir, bow
                            necessary it is to avoid all complication in the future, that General
                            Banks, and the officers serving <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0232"
                            />under his orders, may be again called to the strict observance of the
                            instructions given the 23d November, 1863, from your excellency’s
                            department.</p>
                        <p>I should not, either, leave you in ignorance that the French troops must
                            also have been directed to Sonora, where, according to reports more or
                            less founded, a very considerable number of emigrants from California
                            must lately have disembarked at Guaymas, and have established themselves
                            in the country in virtue of grants which were made to them by the
                            ex-President Juarez. The mission of our forces is to prevent in Sonora
                            all these takings of illicit possession, if they be really attempted,
                            and, in any case, the lawfulness of concessions which shall have
                            emanated from Juarez will never be admitted. Your excellency will
                            probably judge proper to make this known to American citizens who might
                            allow themselves to be drawn into such speculations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 3d instant, in which you inform me that you
                            have received a second despatch from M. Drouyn de l’Huys, pointing to
                            new facts in relation, as I am left to infer, to the proceedings which
                            took place at Matamoras in the case of Mr. Pierce, the consul at that
                            place, and which have been made the subject of recent correspondence, on
                            your part, with this department. I shall with pleasure receive the
                            promised information when the state of your health shall be such as to
                            enable you to visit me, and I sincerely regret the cause by which such a
                            visit is delayed. Since my last note to you on the Matamoras affair was
                            written, I have learned that General Cortinas, with his forces, is
                            certainly adhering to the government of the United States of Mexico. In
                            view of this fact, it is not now apparent to this government that
                            France—being in our view only a belligerent in Mexico, and having no
                            forces at or near Matamoras when the transaction in regard to the consul
                            occurred there—can reasonably expect explanations concerning it from the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>You inform me in the note now before me that, on hearing of that
                            transaction in January last, General Bazaine took the measures necessary
                            to protect the Mexican territory in the direction of Matamoras against
                            any further invasion; and you suggest that, in consequence of that
                            proceeding, Major General Banks, and the officers serving under his
                            orders, may be again called to a strict observance of the instructions
                            which I gave to that general on the 23d of November last. Passing over
                            the words “further invasion” as an accidental assumption of a fact which
                            this government has not conceded, and is not yet prepared to concede, I
                            have had no hesitation in informing Major General Banks of the purpose
                            of General Bazaine, and enjoining the United States general to a strict
                            and faithful observance of the instructions of November, which require
                            him to forbear from any form of intervention in the war between France
                            and Mexico.</p>
                        <p>You also inform me in your last-mentioned note that French forces have
                            been directed towards Sonora, and you bring to my knowledge rumors that
                            a very considerable number of emigrants from California have lately
                            disembarked at Guaymas, and have established themselves in the country
                            in virtue of grants <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0233"/>which were
                            made to them, by President Juarez, whom you describe as ex-President;
                            you further state that the mission of the French forces is to prevent,
                            in Sonora, the taking possession of estates under such grants, the
                            lawfulness of which, you say, will never, be admitted; and you suggest
                            to me the expediency of making this information known to American
                            citizens who might be destined to allow themselves to be drawn into such
                            speculations.</p>
                        <p>While I appreciate the frankness and the good will which the Emperor’s
                            government manifests in thus communicating its views and purposes on the
                            subject mentioned, it nevertheless remains my duty to say that this
                            government has long recognized, and still does continue to recognize,
                            the constitutional government of the United States of Mexico as the
                            sovereign authority in that country, and the President, Benito Juarez,
                            as its chief. This government, at the same time, equally recognizes the
                            condition of war existing in Mexico between that country and France. We
                            maintain absolute neutrality between the belligerents, and we do not
                            assume to judge, much less to judge in advance, of the effect of the war
                            upon titles or estates. We have no knowledge of such an emigration from
                            California to Sonora as you have described in your note; but if such an
                            emigration has taken place, those persons who thus emigrate will of
                            course be regarded as subjecting themselves to the authority and laws by
                            which the rights of citizens of Mexico are governed; and while it seems
                            unnecessary for the President to assume that such emigrants will claim
                            the protection of this government for any estates of whatever kind they
                            may attain or attempt to attain in Mexico, it would certainly be
                            presumptuous to attempt now to decide upon the validity of such
                            claim.</p>
                        <p>Peaceful emigration from the United States is entirely free from
                            restraint or influence of the government. Emigrants themselves are
                            generally well informed concerning their rights. Under these
                            circumstances, any interference of the government concerning such
                            emigration would be as inexpedient as it would be without precedent. The
                            case would be different if the act of emigration was attended with
                            preparations and purposes hostile to Mexico, or to either belligerent
                            party, or to any other nation, and therefore incompatible with the laws
                            of the United States or with the law of nations. It is believed that the
                            government of the United States has already sufficiently indicated the
                            views it must take in such a case if it should occur, which, however,
                            there seems no immediate reason to apprehend.</p>
                        <p>Accept, sir, the renewed assurance of my high consideration.</p>

                            to him by the minister of the United States at Paris on the subject of
                            the arrest of which Mr. Mansfield, consular agent of the United States
                            at Tabasco, had been the object, the 23d December last, his excellency,
                            the minister for foreign affairs, after having asked for information
                            necessary on the matter from his colleagues of the navy and war, has
                            replied to Mr. Dayton that nothing in the correspondence of the agents
                            of the government of the Emperor in Mexico would authorize a belief that
                            such an incident had taken place. M. Drouyn de l’Huys has, at any rate,
                            written again to Mexico to be more completely informed, but, at the same
                            time, he expresses with good right his astonishment at the measures
                            taken by the government of the United States, which, receiving news of
                            this affair from Tabasco, immediately sent to the place a ship-of-war to
                            obtain intelligence. Although this vessel may not have received the
                            order, the government of the Emperor is pleased to believe, to take any
                            action in the case had Mr. Mansfield been in fact arrested, its envoy
                            does not explain at all, by the wish to make a simple inquiry, and it
                            assumes, therefore, in appearance at least, the character of a certain
                            minatory pressure, which is without any justification in the incident
                            itself, or in the nature of the relations of the government of the
                            Emperor with that of the United States.</p>

                            from the troops which are under the command of General Banks in Texas,
                            went from Brownsville and Brazos Santiago, invaded the Mexican territory
                            by taking advantage of the disorder which reigned at Matamoras, and went
                            and carried off a considerable number of bales of cotton deposited at

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your note of the 7th instant, on the
                            subject of the arrest and imprisonment of Mr. Mansfield, United States
                            consul at Tabasco, by the authorities there, has been received. In reply
                            I have to express regret that the Emperor’s government should have
                            regarded the sending of a United States ship-of-war to that quarter, for
                            the sole purpose of inquiring into the transaction, as a minatory
                            proceeding. It certainly was not so intended, but was deemed
                            indispensable from the fact that, even in time of peace, intercourse
                            with Tabasco is irregular, infrequent and indirect. It had become so
                            much more so of late, that this department had not, and even to this
                            time has not received any authentic information in regard to Mr.
                            Mansfield’s offence, from either United States, Mexican, or French
                            sources. Of course, no opinion can be formed upon the subject until such
                            information shall have been furnished.</p>
                        <p>I will add, however, that in directing Mr. Dayton to apprise M. Drouyn de
                            l’Huys that a vessel-of-war had, in point of fact, been despatched to
                            Tabasco, this department inadvertently supposed that that step had been
                            adopted. It has now been ascertained, however, that, at the time when
                            the request for that purpose was made of the Navy Department it was not
                            convenient, nor has it since beeen convenient, to comply with it.
                            Probably, therefore, a report upon the subject may be received from the
                            Emperor’s government before an inquiry in the form indicated can be made
                            by the United States government.</p>
                        <p>Accept, sir, the renewed assurance of my high consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Some months since a society was formed in
                            the city of New Orleans, the object of which is to make enrolments and
                            purchases of arms and ammunition destined for Mexico. This association,
                            openly avowed and known under the name of club of the Defenders of the
                            Monroe DoGtrine, D. M. D., has its regular meetings, duly announced by
                            means of the newspapers, and employs all measures of propagandism for
                            raising subscriptions and making proselytes. At its head are some
                            Mexican refugees, and notably a Colonel de Borden; some number of
                            federal officers also form part of it, and Governor Hahn himself, whose
                            opinions are known, has been received as a member; already transmissions
                            of arms and munitions have been directed toward the frontier of the Rio

                            connivance of some of the authorities of the United States. It suffices

                            of Mexico, not to feel certain in advance that the government of the
                            United States will take the most effective measures to repress them, and
                            that it will, in an exemplary manner, deal severely with those of its

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to return herewith
                                the despatch of M. de Geofroy, chargé d’affaires of France,
                                respecting the proposed increase of duties on articles of French
                                production, caused by your letter of the 6th instant, inviting my
                                attention to the statements of M. de Geofroy, of the operation of
                                the present tariff upon the commerce of France and the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>It is a matter of regret that our civil war should affect unfavorably
                                the commercial interests of France, and it is my wish that whatever
                                tariff of duties may be created by Congress under the pressure of
                                our great expenditures, the duties on French products may be in
                                perfect equality with the duties levied on the products of other
                                nations.</p>
                            <p>I would respectfully suggest that this despatch of M. de Geofroy be
                                communicated to the Committee of Ways and Means, for their
                                consideration.</p>

                            under certain restrictions, explained in the printed regulations which

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of your letter of the 22d instant, enclosing a translation
                                of the note of M. de Geofroy, relative to the alleged introduction
                                of brandies and spirits into New Orleans, notwithstanding the
                                prohibition made by the instructions of this department, when the
                                blockade of that port was relaxed.</p>
                            <p>Brandies and spirits may be transported to New Orleans under the 38th
                                regulation of trade, issued September 11, 1863, by the special
                                direction of the supervising special agent, sanctioned by the
                                general commanding; and I have reason to believe that all spirituous
                                liquors sold in that city are transported thither in accordance with
                                that regulation.</p>
                            <p>The operation of this rule is not restricted to citizens of the
                                United States, but subjects of foreign governments are at liberty to
                                avail themselves of the advantages of such trade on complying with
                                the laws and regulations referred to.</p>
                            <p>To accomplish this, however, it will probably be necessary for your
                                department to issue instructions to United States consuls to grant
                                licenses for shipment of liquors to the reopened ports, the
                                shipment.of which is previously approved by the general commanding
                                and supervising special agents as above.</p>

                        <p>It seems that Brownsville, on the Rio Grande, is the very active centre
                            of a traffic in articles contraband of war, a traffic which is carried
                            on for account of the agents of Mr. Juarez, and that the federal
                            authorities, who are accused of deriving large profits from it, favor,
                            in place of hindering it; that General Herron, who commands at
                            Brownsville, is on the best terms with Mr. Cortinas, whom he aids with
                            all his power, by furnishing him arms, munitions, and even recruits, and
                            that he loudly avows his sympathies with the pretended government which
                            he still represents at Matamoras. The collector of the federal customs
                            at Brownsville must be also, as it is given out, in connivance with Mr.
                            Cortinas.</p>
                        <p>It seems that at this moment a ship is being laden near Boston, which is
                            to carry to Mexico one or two batteries of artillery, carbines, swords,
                            and bayonets. Contracts for these articles, contraband of war, have been
                            made already, some weeks since, and the vessel which will carry them
                            will, to turn aside suspicion, be cleared from some small port in New
                            England. She will be given Brazos as her destination, which is at a
                            short distance from the mouth of the Rio Grande, and from that locality
                            the cargo will be sent on its way to a point occupied by the agents of
                            Mr. Juarez.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 30th of April last I had the honor
                            to receive your note, written on the 26th of that month, in which you
                            informed me that a society had been formed in the city of New Orleans,
                            the object of which is to make enrolments and purchases of arms and
                            ammunition destined for Mexico. You further informed me that this
                            association, openly avowed, and known under the name of the club of the
                            “Defenders of the Monroe Doctrine, D. M. D.,” has its regular meetings,
                            duly announced by means of the newspapers, and employs all means of
                            propagandism for raising subscriptions and making proselytes; that at
                            its head are some Mexican refugees, and notably a Colonel De Borden,
                            some number of federal officers also form part of it, and Governor Hahn
                            himself, whose opinions are known, has been received as a member; that
                            transmissions of arms and munitions have already been directed towards
                            the Rio Grande, and that you were assured, although you did not like to
                            believe it, that such transmission of arms and munitions were made with
                            the connivances of some of the authorities of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I lost no time in bringing the complaints which you thus preferred, in
                            their full effect, to the knowledge of Major General Banks, who is in
                            command of <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0240"/>the United States
                            forces west of the Mississippi, and also to the knowledge of his
                            excellency Michael Hahn, the governor of the State of Louisiana.</p>
                        <p>I have now the honor to inform you that I have received from the governor
                            of Louisiana an official communication in relation to these complaints,
                            of the effect following, namely: that there is a society or club in New
                            Orleans under the name of the “Defences of the Monroe Doctrine;” that
                            his excellency Michael Hahn is not a member of the club, or of any
                            similar association; that the presiding officer of the club is Colonel
                            F. N. D. S. Borden, who is understood to be a loyal citizen of the
                            republic of Mexico; that the only citizens of New Orleans who are known
                            to the governor as belonging to the club are a few young men of no
                            considerable influence; that the object of the club, so far as the
                            governor has been able to ascertain it, is to bring moral influences to
                            bear upon the government of the United States in favor of a maintenance
                            of the Monroe doctrine, but not to act in violation of the law, or of
                            the well-understood governmental policy of neutrality, in the war which
                            exists between France and Mexico; that so far as the governor has
                            learned, there has been neither any enrolment of men, nor any
                            subscriptions of money, by the club, or by any other association, for
                            the purposes of war in Mexico. Nor have any arms, ammunition, or men,
                            been sent there, through any association of persons in the State of
                            Louisiana, so far as the governor knows, or has even heard.</p>
                        <p>I am further assured by his excellency that he cordially co-operates with
                            the other public officers in Louisiana in carrying out the known
                            instructions and wishes of the President and this department, and in
                            observing and enforcing the provisions of the law relating to the
                            neutrality of the United States in the war between France and
                            Mexico.</p>
                        <p>It remains only to assure your excellency that this department reposes
                            implicit confidence in the statements of Governor Hahn; and,
                            consequently, that there have been no such violations of the neutrality
                            of the United States in New Orleans, as through misinformation your
                            excellency has been led to represent.</p>
                        <p>Accept, sir, a renewed assurance of my very high consideration.</p>

                            were imparted to you in my note of the 28th ultimo. General Banks
                            further reports, that if there are any federal officers connected with
                            the before-named society, they are not men of influence or character.
                            Officers may have been led in some instances to associate themselves
                            with it out of motives of curiosity, but have abandoned the organization
                            as soon as its unlawful character and purposes became known; that a

                            dismissed from the service. If enlisted <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222"

                            and in many instances of disreputable character; that as a combination
                            this association is unimportant in its influence upon international
                            relations, but that there are some dangerous men connected with it; that
                            they had before and since the receipt of my communication to Major
                            General Banks, of the 30th April, been under close surveillance; that
                            their objects are to enlist men, and, perhaps, to obtain arms and other
                            materials for offensive demonstrations in Mexico or elsewhere; that it
                            is quite as likely, however, to be intended to further their own
                            ambitious personal projects and fortunes as to interfere in the affairs
                            of Mexico or any other nation; that an arrest of these parties was made
                            at the earliest moment when proof could be obtained of that purpose;
                            that the steamer Crescent, upon which they had taken passage for
                            Brownsville, was seized a few days since by Brigadier General Bowen,
                            provost marshal general, and the departure of the expedition
                            prevented.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Major General Banks reassures me that every precaution
                            will be taken to avoid any unlawful interference with the affairs of
                            Mexico, in violation of the policy of this government, as defined in my
                            instructions to him.</p>
                        <p>Accept, sir, a renewed assurance of my highest consideration.</p>

                            month, on the subject of shipments of arms and munitions to Mexico by
                            the frontier of the Rio Grande, having been communicated to Major
                            General Banks, that officer had just informed your excellency that he
                            had given his attention to the affair, and, in consequence, had caused
                            the seizure of some articles suspected of being contraband of war
                            destined to Mexico; and, besides, that General Herron had been called to
                            the position of General McClernand, in command of the 13th corps, who
                            would have his headquarters in Louisiana.</p>
                        <p>I hasten, sir, to thank you for the news, and am going to communicate it
                            to the government of the Emperor, which will appreciate, no doubt, as I

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit to you
                            herewith the copy of a petition which was recently addressed to the
                            consul general of the Emperor at New <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223"
                                facs="0243"/>York, by Captain Chaniel, commanding the ship called
                            Provençale, from Senegal, and by Mr. Bergham, the consignee of that
                            ship. It would appear from this document that after the regular entry at
                            the custom-house, and at the time they were proceeding to the discharge
                            of the cargo, consisting of skins, gums, and nuts, the custom-house
                            officers objected to the landing of the nuts until said merchandise had
                            paid the double of the duty already assessed and paid, upon the ground
                            that the productions of Senegal do not enjoy the same privileges
                            reserved by the treaty between France and the United States to the
                            productions of France.</p>
                        <p>The question started by the custom-house appears to me to be the result
                            of an error, for in the case that the custom-house had a right to exact
                            a higher duty upon productions other than those directly coming from the
                            French ports on the European continent, this tax could only be a
                            discriminating duty, which generally amounts to ten per cent. upon the
                            sum of the regular duties, and not the double of it, as demanded in the
                            present case</p>
                        <p>The captain and consignee of the Provençale have suspended the work of
                            unloading until more fully informed. I therefore request your excellency
                            to be pleased to ask for, and communicate to me, as soon as possible, a
                            decision upon this subject from the Treasury Department.</p>

                            <p>Since the departure of Mr. James, collector of the customs at San
                                Francisco, the deputy collector, who replaced him, Mr. Cushman, has
                                the air of receiving with great earnestness my communications for
                                hindering the shipment of arms, gunpowder, and articles contraband
                                of war, destined for Mexican ports, but the sum of it is, that he
                                does nothing to stop them.</p>
                            <p>There is here a Mexican general, named De Vega, who has come with
                                money to get ready armaments in favor of ex-President Juarez; he
                                purchases small vessels, loads them with arms and gunpowder, and
                                applies at the custom-house, <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0244"
                                />through his agents, to clear these vessels for the river Colorado,
                                where there are several American settlements. In this manner the
                                vessels get away with the permission of the custom-house, and under
                                any pretext touch at some points on the Mexican coast, where they
                                land their cargoes. Thus, quite lately, the American schooner
                                Potter, cleared on these conditions, put ashore at Guaymas 2,500
                                barrels of gunpowder and fire-arms. I complain bitterly of these
                                subterfuges to the local authorities. I ask the deputy collector to
                                exact security from the fitters out of vessels laden with articles
                                contraband of war, and cleared for the American ports on the banks
                                of the Colorado; he promises me mountains and miracles, but I do not
                                obtain from him any positive result. The chief of police only, Mr.
                                Burke, actively seconds my investigations.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of communication dated May 28, Department of State,
                                enclosing a memorandum from the French chargé d’affaires concerning
                                a trade in munitions of war alleged to be carried on between
                                Brownsville, Texas, and Matamoras, Mexico.</p>
                            <p>In reply to the surmise I have only to report that till the last of
                                May I was daily and constantly at Brownsville in charge of the
                                custom-house affairs, and I am certain that no such trade existed;
                                in fact, the sole trade we had was with New Orleans, a city itself
                                under martial law, and from whence no such supplies could be
                                drawn.</p>
                            <p>As for the connivance of the collector of the customs, it is useless
                                to refute, as he has no discretionary powers in such matters. Should
                                munitions of war arrive at the port of Brazos de Santiago, they will
                                come under the authority of the proper authorities; should they not
                                have those authorizations they would, of course, be seized as
                                contraband.</p>
                            <p>As regards the loading of a vessel or vessels near Boston with
                                munitions for Mexico, I know nothing, nor have I ever heard of such
                                a scheme.</p>
                            <p>I would also beg leave to refer you to the monthly reports of exports
                                and Imports, which show <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the business of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received the letter dated the 15th,
                            in which you inform me, while transmitting to me the report of the
                            military authorities, that the person <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227"
                                facs="0247"/>named Cauvet, a French subject, whose discharge I had
                            asked in the month of March last, was killed on the 18th of May, in the
                            action at Drury’s Bluff.</p>
                        <p>It appears from an official communication from the Secretary of War,
                            which your excellency had transmitted to me at the time, that at the
                            date of the 12th April, sundry communications had been exchanged between
                            his department and the chiefs of that corps respecting the said Cauvet,
                            which communications have never been brought to my knowledge, from which
                            I infer that they proved the fact of the kidnapping. At that period,
                            therefore, the War Department knew what to do with respect to said
                            Cauvet; it could have ordered his discharge, and it could readily do so,
                            for the campaign had not yet commenced. Administrative delays, to be
                            deplored, have retained him under the banners until he has there found
                            death.</p>
                        <p>I limit myself to point out to your excellency this new fact, having
                            furthermore nothing to add to the reflections which the analogous case
                            of the seaman Martin have inspired me with, and which I submitted on the
                            6th of this month to your impartial appreciation.</p>
                        <p>I avail myself of this occasion to renew to your excellency the
                            assurances of my high consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Upon the initiative taken by some honored
                            citizens of the Swiss Confederation, particularly by General Dufour and
                            Mr. Henri Dunant, an international conference was held at Geneva in the
                            month of October last for the purpose of finding means to meet the
                            insufficiency of the sanitary service in armies in the field. The larger
                            number of foreign governments were there represented by delegates, and
                            resolutions were adopted for carrying into effect the generous
                            thought.</p>
                        <p>Encouraged by these first results, the Genevese committee of aid for
                            wounded soldiers has expressed the wish that an international congress,
                            at which all governments should be invited to take part, could assemble
                            to examine the resolutions of that conference, and to change them, if
                            there was room for it, into a diplomatic arrangement.</p>
                        <p>The Swiss federal council has thought it ought to become the interpreter
                            of this wish by addressing to all the foreign states official
                            invitations for the assemblage at Geneva of a general congress, the
                            opening of which should be fixed for the 8th of August next; and
                            knowing, besides, the lively interest which the Emperor takes in this
                            work of humanity, it has expressed the desire that its measures should
                            be sustained by his Majesty’s government. The Emperor has, in effect,
                            shown from the beginning all the sympathy with the project which the
                            federal council now seeks to realize, and has willingly declared himself
                            ready to second the efforts of the promoters of an enterprise called to
                            render such useful service to armies in the field, and to soften the
                            evils inseparable from war. I am therefore authorized, sir, to make
                            known this sentiment to the government of the United States, and to
                            testify to it the satisfaction his Majesty would experience to see the
                            acceptance by it of the propositions of the federal council. The
                            delegates of the government of the Emperor to the international <pb
                                n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0248"/>congress of Geneva will be Mr.
                            Tagerschmidt, sub-director in the department of foreign affairs; de

                                charged has not been collected.”</p>
                            <p>It will be seen from this report that the petitioner (the master of
                                the Provençale) has misapprehended the facts of the case, mistaking
                                the 50 per cent. additional duty assessed alike upon the cargoes of
                                American and foreign vessels, under the joint resolution of 29th
                                April, for a discriminating duty, and that the action of the
                                collector was in accordance with law.</p>
                            <p>I do not understand Mr. de Geofroy as claiming exemption for the
                                goods in question from the charge of the discriminating duty of 10
                                per cent.; but if he does, I may add that the treaty of June 24,
                                1822, (Stat, at Large, vol. 8, pp. 278 and 280, arts. 1, 2, 3, and
                                7,) expressly limits the exemptions to “productions of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">soil or industry of France,</hi> imported in
                                French bottoms into the ports of the United States.”</p>
                            <p>That it was not intended to extend to the productions of French
                                colonies is further shown by several subsequent acts of Congress
                                extending similar privileges <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0249"
                                />to certain French possessions, among which, however, Senegal is
                                not included, as, for instance, the acts of May 9, 1828, Stat., vol.
                                4, p. 269, chap. 49; July 13, 1832, Stat., vol. 4, p. 573, chap.
                                196, and others.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the case of A. Cauvet,
                            which was the subject of your note to this department of the 18th
                            ultimo, I have the honor to communicate a report from the Adjutant
                            General to the Secretary of War, of the 20th instant, and the documents
                            by which it was accompanied.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Stanton, in his letter to this department, transmitting the report,
                            expresses an opinion that these papers show:</p>
                        <p>First. That no person bearing the name of A. Cauvet (the name furnished
                            by you) has at any time been in the military service of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Second. That if the person entered upon the muster-rolls as E. Caulet be
                            the person referred to by you, the War Department was misled in its
                            investigation by the information which you furnished, or by the false
                            designation of himself given by the signature of A. Cauvet.</p>
                        <p>This department sees no reason to withhold its concurrence in this
                            opinion. The Secretary of War also expresses what seems to be a just
                            sensibility, that the authorities of his department should, upon ex
                            parte representations only, have been charged with kidnapping Cauvet,
                            whose case is claimed to have been <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230"
                                facs="0250"/>as promptly, diligently, and impartially examined as,
                            under the circumstances, was practicable.</p>
                        <p>I feel confident that you will authorize me to assure him that you have
                            not designed to be understood as adopting that imputation.</p>
                        <p>The report of the Adjutant General being an original paper, I would be
                            obliged by the return of it, and of the papers which accompany it, when
                            you shall have done with them.</p>
                        <p>Accept, sir, the renewed assurance of my highest consideration,</p>

                                case of “A. Cauvet,” or “E. Caulet,” referred to this office, I have
                                the honor to report that, on the 9th day of March, 1864, a letter
                                was received from the Secretary of State, addressed to the Secretary
                                of War, accompanied by a letter dated the 2d of March, addressed by
                                Mr. L. de Geofroy, of the French legation, to the Secretary of
                                State, and a translation of a statement signed “A. Cauvet, 3d
                                regiment V. H. V., Morris island, South Carolina,” copies whereof,
                                marked A, are hereto attached. These papers were, immediately upon
                                their receipt, referred to the Adjutant General of the army for
                                investigation and report upon the subject to which they related.</p>
                            <p>There is no military organization in the service of the United States
                                known or designated by the initials “V. H. V;” examination was
                                therefore made of all the muster-rolls of the troops at Morris
                                island on the 23d day of December, 1863, and it was found that no
                                name of “A. Cauvet” was entered thereon.</p>
                            <p>On the 15th of March, in order that further investigation might be
                                made at the place where “A. Cauvet” represented himself to be, the
                                letter of the Secretary of State, with the letter of Mr. Geofroy and
                                the accompanying translation, signed “A. Cauvet,” was transmitted by
                                the Adjutant General to Major General Gillmore, commanding the
                                department of the south, (of which Morris island, South Carolina,
                                forms a part,) with directions to investigate and report upon the
                                subject-matter of the inquiry presented by the letter of the
                                Secretary of State. That reference was received at Hilton Head by
                                General Gillmore on the 24th of March, and was by him referred to
                                the commanding officer of the 3d New Hampshire volunteers, it being
                                conjectured that by a mistake of “A. Cauvet,” or the transcriber of
                                his letter, the initials “V. H. V.” might be intended to denote that
                                regiment, which is designated by the initials “N. H. V.” Two days
                                afterwards, (on the 26th of March,) the commanding officer of the 3d
                                New Hampshire regiment reported to General Gillmore that there was
                                no such man as the person described by Mr. Geofroy in that regiment.
                                On the 28th of March the papers were returned to General Gillmore,
                                with the report that there was no such man found in the regiment
                                named. This report of General Gillmore was received by the
                                department on the 9th day of April.</p>
                            <p>The paper furnished by Mr. Geofroy, and signed “A. Cauvet,”
                                represented that he was put into the army of the United States in
                                the city of New York, and on the 12th of April, three days after the
                                receipt of General Gillmore’s return, the letter of the Secretary of
                                State, with Mr. Geofroy’s letter and the <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231"
                                    facs="0251"/>accompanying translation, signed “A. Cauvet,” was
                                referred to Brigadier General William Hays, assistant provost
                                marshal general for the southern division of New York, having in
                                charge enlistments made in the city of New York, for such
                                information as he could obtain in relation to the enlistment of the
                                person mentioned by Mr. Geofroy. Diligent examination was made by
                                this provost marshal, who, on the 27th of May, reported that he was
                                unable to find any record of this man’s enlistment.</p>
                            <p>On the 26th of May a second letter was received from the Secretary of
                                State (a copy of which, marked B, is hereto attached) in relation to
                                the case, which had, during all the intermediate period, been under
                                examination at Washington, in the department of the south, at Morris
                                island, and in New York; and on the 28th of May, but before the
                                report of the provost marshal was received, a reply was transmitted
                                to the Secretary of State, a copy of which, marked C, is hereto
                                appended.</p>
                            <p>No trace of “A. Cauvet” having been found at Morris island, or in the
                                city of New York, under the supposition that there might possibly be
                                a mistake by “A. Cauvet” as to the number of the regiment, the case
                                was referred to the mustering officer in the State of New Hampshire,
                                with instructions to make an investigation of all the rolls of
                                volunteers from that State. On the 15th of June Captain Silvey,
                                mustering officer in the State of New Hampshire, reported that no
                                such name as “A. Cauvet” was found in the records of his office. A
                                re-examination of the rolls in the War Department was then ordered,
                                for the purpose of ascertaining if any person bearing a French name
                                had been mustered into the service in the 3d regiment of New
                                Hampshire volunteers, and it was found that a person designated by
                                the name of “Emile Caulet” was mustered into the service on the 10th
                                of October, 1863, at West Lebanon, in the State of New Hampshire, in
                                the 3d regiment of New Hampshire volunteers, (which regiment was, on
                                the 23d December, 1863, serving at Morris island) as a substitute
                                for one William N. Stowell, of Claremont, in the State above named.
                                A photographic copy of the enlistment paper is hereby annexed,
                                marked D, and also a photographic copy of his signature on the
                                pay-roll. Upon this report being received, on the 16th of June, the
                                subject was again referred to the commanding officer of the 3d New
                                Hampshire volunteers serving at Morris island, to ascertain and
                                report whether “Emile Caulet” could be the person referred to by Mr.
                                Geofroy as “A. Cauvet.” On the 28th of June the report of the
                                commanding officer was received, dated at the headquarters of the 3d
                                New Hampshire volunteers, at Bermuda Hundred, to which place the
                                regiment, with the forces that were serving on Morris island, had
                                been transferred. A copy of his report is herewith transmitted,
                                marked E. On the 6th of July the Adjutant General made a report in
                                the case to the Secretary of War, a copy of which is hereto annexed,
                                marked F. This report was communicated to the Secretary of State by
                                a letter dated the 8th of July, a copy of which is also annexed,
                                marked G.</p>
                            <p>From the time when Mr. Geofroy’s letter was received by this
                                department, on the 11th of March, the most diligent industry was
                                employed by the Adjutant General, and by the military officers to
                                whom reference was made, to ascertain whether such a person as A.
                                Cauvet, mentioned in the letter of Mr. Geofroy, was in the military
                                service of the United States, and the circumstances under which he
                                was mustered in, with a view to such action as the facts, when
                                discovered, might require. But neither the enlistment rolls nor
                                investigation by commanding officers disclosed that any person
                                bearing the name of A. Cauvet was mustered into the service in New
                                York, or was in any military organization of the United States at
                                Morris island or else where, on the 23d day of December, 1863. If
                                the conjecture of Colonel Plympton, that the person borne on the <pb
                                    n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0252"/>rolls as E. Caulet is the
                                same mentioned by Mr. Geofroy as A. Cauvet, be correct, the
                                department was misled in its investigation by Mr. Geofroy and the
                                translated papers furnished. No delay, failure, or neglect of duty
                                can justly be imputed to any officer of the service properly to
                                investigate and diligently to ascertain the facts upon which the
                                Secretary of State desired information from the War Department. It
                                is not true that the department has now, or ever has had, any
                                knowledge from which to infer the “fact of the kidnapping” of such
                                person, or of any other French subject, or that any fact was known
                                to the War Department upon which the discharge of A. Cauvet or E.
                                Caulet could be claimed. On the contrary, it appears from his
                                enlistment paper, on file in this department, (the copy whereof,
                                marked D, is hereto attached,) that Emile Caulet voluntarily offered
                                himself as a substitute for William N. Stowell, and was mustered
                                into the service of the United States at West Lebanon, in the State
                                of New Hampshire, on the 10th day of October, 1863. The pay-rolls
                                show that he duly and regularly received the first instalment of
                                bounty under the act of Congress.</p>
                            <p>An official investigation, made by Major Turner, the judge advocate,
                                (a copy of whose report is hereto annexed, marked H,) has
                                ascertained that Caulet, (who had been a waiter by occupation, was
                                twenty-five years old, and had been residing in the city of New
                                York,) offered himself and was received into the military service of
                                the United States as a voluntary substitute for William N. Stowell,
                                of Claremont, in the State of New Hampshire; that he received from
                                Stowell the sum of three hundred dollars in money, as a price or
                                consideration for becoming said substitute; that he received from
                                the board of enrolment of West Lebanon clothing to the value of $16
                                69 when he was mustered into the service; that he subscribed an oath
                                to the fact of his becoming a substitute for Stowell for the period
                                of three years, unless sooner discharged; and also a declaration
                                that he was twenty-five years of age, and enlisted for three years.
                                The members of the board of enrolment also certify that Caulet, at
                                the time he offered himself as a voluntary substitute, was neither
                                intoxicated nor induced to enlist by any undue or wrongful
                                influence.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the most rigorous investigation, no facts or
                                circumstances have come to the knowledge of the department, by
                                correspondence with corps commanders or otherwise, indicating, or
                                from which it could be inferred, that Caulet was kidnapped, or
                                unfairly enlisted in the service of the United States, or that any
                                fraud, or artifice, or wrong, was practiced against him. The
                                insulting imputation against the department and corps commanders of
                                such knowledge, contained in the recent letter of Mr. Geofroy to the
                                Secretary of State, is most unfair and unjust towards officers who
                                labored with their utmost skill and industry to ascertain the facts
                                submitted to them for investigation.</p>

                                        the purpose of obtaining the liberation of his son,

                                    <p>I am going to tell you something that will not give you much
                                        pleasure. I would tell you that I had hardly received your
                                        letter, when I settled my account at the house where I was,
                                        and came back to New York, where I stayed some days awaiting
                                        a vessel on which to return to France; but meantime persons
                                        came looking for me, and telling me I was a soldier, and
                                        that I must go, because my name had been given at the hotel
                                        where I was staying, without my knowing anything about it,
                                        and told me the chances had fallen on me. There were two of
                                        us in this situation, and we were told we could not be
                                        obliged to become soldiers, but we had no person to take
                                        care of us, and meantime we were taken to an island in the
                                        neighborhood, and gradually, a month afterwards, we were off
                                        the city of Charleston, thoroughly enrolled in the regiment,
                                        and, at the end of some days, were carrying on our backs the
                                        knapsack and musket.</p>

                                    and West Lebanon, New Hampshire, to investigate the case of <hi

                                <p>At West Lebanon I saw the members of the board of enrolment
                                    (Chester Pike, provost marshal; Francis A. Faulkner,
                                    commissioner, and Dixi Crosby, surgeon) of the 3d congressional
                                    district, examined their official records and papers, and
                                    ascertained the following facts:</p>
                                <p>That Emile Caulet, on the 10th day of October, 1863, offered
                                    himself, and was received and mustered into the United States
                                    service, at West Lebanon, New Hampshire, as a substitute for
                                    William N. Stowell, of Claremont, New Hampshire.</p>
                                <p>That said Caulet was a native of France, a waiter by occupation,
                                    twenty-five years old, dark eyes, black hair, and dark
                                    complexion; and resided in New York when mustered into the
                                    service as a voluntary substitute.</p>
                                <p>That he received from said Stowell three hundred dollars ($300)
                                    in money as the full price or consideration for becoming the
                                    said substitute.</p>
                                <p>That he drew and received from the board of enrolment at West
                                    Lebanon, New Hampshire, clothing of the money value of sixteen
                                    dollars and sixty-nine cents ($16 69) when mustered into the
                                    United States service.</p>
                                <p>That he duly subscribed and made oath October 10, 1863, to the
                                    facts of his becoming said substitute for said Stowell, as a

                                    &amp;c.; and he also subscribed a declaration that he was
                                    twenty-five years of age; enlisted for three years in the United
                                    States army; knew no impediment to his serving honestly and
                                    faithfully as such soldier, &amp;c. The members of the board of

                        <p>Recent advices, brought from Mexico to the government of the Emperor,
                            have apprised him that very grave events, the responsibility for which
                            would fall upon the government of the United States, if it neglected to
                            take them into serious consideration, would be again brought about at
                            Matamoras. A great number of federals, after having evacuated
                            Brownsville, have, as it seems, passed the Rio Bravo and put themselves
                            at the disposal of Mr. Cortinas. This chief would also have received a
                            considerable supply of arms and munition, despatched from American
                            territory. If these advices are true, as it seems there is no ground to
                            doubt, there must have been there a violation of neutrality, which of
                            itself alone would give sufficient ground for reclamation on the part of
                            the government of the Emperor. But the life of French subjects has
                            ceased to be respected by the party dominant at Matamoras; two of them,
                            as it seems, had been shot by order of Mr. Cortinas. It will therefore
                            be the duty of the government of the Emperor to protest the more
                            energetically against the support given in this circumstance to its
                            adversaries.</p>

                            on the basis of the tariff then recognized—that is to say, five days

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 28th April, 1864, we received,
                                to us consigned, the brig Katica, from Marseilles, with an assorted
                                cargo. According to custom, we entered the vessel at the
                                custom-house five days after her arrival in port—say the 2d May.
                                After having fulfilled at the custom-house all the formalities
                                required by the United States, paid the duties on this cargo, we
                                obtained the papers necessary to dispose of this merchandise, which
                                we had published through the journals as to be sold at auction on
                                the 4th of said month.</p>
                            <p>In conformity with this notice, the sale of this merchandise took
                                place on the 4th of May, on the levee, by the agency of Mr. Bernard
                                Tarpin, public auctioneer. Almost the whole cargo was sold on the
                                levee, and delivered the next day to the buyers; in consequence,
                                after the 5th of said month of May we are no longer holders of this
                                merchandise—that is to say, four days before the law of fifty per
                                cent. additional duty was known here, for that news was not known
                                until the 9th or 10th of May.</p>
                            <p>The collector of the customs pretends to exact from us the fifty per
                                cent additional duty on this cargo, upon the pretext that the law
                                was in force from the day of its approval.</p>
                            <p>Even admitting this fact, that a law may be in force before it can be
                                known, we ask, upon what have we to pay this fifty per cent.,
                                inasmuch as we no longer have this merchandise?</p>
                            <p>It is plain that it is the merchandise that must be subject to duty
                                on entry, and not the merchant; for if the merchandise was still in
                                our hands we could, on paying this additional duty, raise the price
                                of the merchandise, and thus reimburse ourselves for this
                                augmentation; whilst in this particular case in which we are placed,
                                if we were to be condemned to pay this addition of fifty per cent.
                                upon merchandise which has no longer any existence for us, this loss
                                would fall upon ourselves, which would be contrary to every
                                principle of equity; because the merchant would be compelled to pay
                                a duty of fifty per cent. on merchandise which he no longer has, but
                                which he has had at a time more or less further back. We submit
                                these facts to you, Mr. Consul, begging you to be so good as to
                                bring them to the notice of the minister of France at Washington,
                                and to aid our remonstrance.</p>

                        <p>A fraudulent shipment of arms destined for Mexico took place at San
                            Francisco at the close of the month of July. A portion of it was seized
                            through the efforts of Colonel James, collector of the customs at that
                            city, upon the suggestions of his Majesty’s consul; the residue,
                            enumerated in the invoice annexed, was got out of the way and shipped on
                            a small vessel, which, by the latest accounts, must be anchored, it is
                            said, in one of the coves of the bay of San Francisco. When prescribing
                            to Colonel James the most active search upon this subject, the
                            Department of State is begged to recommend to him to cause constant
                            watch to be kept on the conduct of a certain General Vega, who is at San
                            Francisco, the agent for this sort of operations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: I have no other information in
                            relation to that which has just occurred at Brownsville than what is
                            contained in the paper. Whatever the causes which have led to it, it
                            would seem, if we are to believe them, that the Mexican chief, Cortinas,
                            has entered the territory of the United States with a corps of troops,
                            to which, it is said, he has even given of his own authority the flag of
                            the Union. This last act shows a boldness for which he, no doubt, will
                            have to account to the federal government. That which interests me is
                            that he be disarmed, and does never leave the American territory to make
                            some incursion with his men upon the right bank of the Rio Grande. I am
                            sure, in advance, that upon the first intelligence of this affair you
                            will have sent to Texas the strictest orders, in order that the duties
                            which vicinage and neutrality require be strictly observed by the
                            officers of the federal forces in that part of the country; and I have
                            no need of insisting upon the grave responsibility which the latter
                            might entail upon their government if, in contempt of their
                            instructions, they should permit these refugees to station themselves
                            upon the frontier, and there to commit acts of hostility, directly or
                            indirectly; there to prepare expeditions, transfers of men and
                            munitions; and, finally, there to render aid in any manner to the party
                            in arms in the interior of Mexico against the troops of his Majesty. I
                            will only remark to you that this recent act, when it shall be known in
                            Paris, will make more pressing the demand for explanations, which I have
                            recently been charged to address to you on the subject of the relations,
                            not very intimate, which previously existed between Cortinas and some
                            generals of the United States from one bank to the other of the Rio
                            Grande, and particularly upon the sale of arms belonging to the
                            government of the United States, which was made by these latter to that
                            chief. I would therefore thank you to hasten the reply which you have
                            been pleased to promise me upon this subject, at the same time that you

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your note from Montreal, of the 23d, was
                            received here on the 26th instant.</p>
                        <p>When I saw the earlier newspaper reports of an alleged entrance of
                            General Cortinas within the territory of the United States, I deemed
                            them improbable and unreliable. The only official information upon the
                            subject which has been received is a statement contained in a report
                            made by Major General Canby to the Secretary of War. Upon receiving that
                            statement I immediately transmitted to Mr. Dayton a despatch containing
                            the same statement, of which I now give you a copy for your information.
                            Subsequent newspaper publications discredit the original rumors in the
                            most essential parts; the latter, however, like the first, are vague and
                            unsatisfactory. I have, therefore, addressed myself, through the War
                            Department, to Major General Canby, and requested a full statement of
                            the facts, and at the same time, although deeming it quite unnecessary,
                            I have, by command of the President, renewed the injunction heretofore
                            given, that the military forces of the United States must neither
                            commit, nor suffer within the jurisdiction of the United States, any
                            violation of the neutrality of this government in the conflict now going
                            on in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Accept, sir, the assurance of my very high consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the remonstrance of
                            Messrs. Brulaton &amp; Company, of New Orleans, against the exaction of
                            certain duties, I have the honor to state that this department is
                            informed by the Secretary of the Treasury that although a knowledge of
                            the passage of the joint resolution of Congress of the 29th of April
                            last, imposing an additional duty of fifty per cent. on importations,
                            did not reach New Orleans until the 8th of May, from four to six days
                            after the arrival of the brig Katica from Marseilles, and the sale of
                            the greater part of the cargo, yet that the courts of the United States,
                            as long ago as 1818, decided that an importer is personally liable for
                            the duties legally due to the United States on the importation of any
                            goods, wares, or merchandise. The Secretary of the Treasury is
                            consequently of the opinion that he has no authority to issue orders to
                            the collector of the customs at New Orleans to desist from his claim in
                            the case referred to.</p>
                        <p>It is possible, however, that upon a proper application to Congress the

                            <p>The subjects of France residing in the southern States are daily
                                placed in the dilemma, by the local authorities, of taking service
                                in the confederate army or of leaving the country. Many among them
                                have declared their purpose to adopt the latter alternative, but the
                                government at Richmond, in turn, interposes obstructions, not
                                permitting them to pass the frontiers by land. It only authorizes
                                them to pass out by way of the sea, making use of vessels running
                                the blockade, which is dangerous, and also very expensive.</p>
                            <p>The legation of the Emperor, desiring to come to the aid of these
                                French subjects, is disposed, if the government of the United States
                                sees no objection to it, to send one or two ships-of-war to one of
                                the southern ports to receive them, and to transport them to New
                                York.</p>
                            <p>Admiral Reynaud, having been consulted on the question of ways and
                                means, has indicated the port of Charleston as the most proper for
                                this operation, in a maritime point of view, Savannah and Wilmington
                                not having water enough for his ships, and he is ready to despatch
                                one or two at need to that port as soon as he shall have received
                                official advice of the assent of the government of he United

                            sending to Charleston of one or two of his Majesty’s ships-of-war to
                            receive these unfortunates, with their families. There is in this a duty
                            of humanity to fulfil, which accords also, I think, with good policy. I
                            therefore do not doubt that the government of the United States will
                            give its assent. I will only take the liberty to observe to your
                            excellency that the circumstances are pressing to these poor people.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Reynaud, on his part, would desire not to lose time.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I pray your excellency to be so good as to issue for me,
                            without the least delay, the needful orders; and, in any case, it would
                            be very gratifying to me that you could give me this morning the formal
                            assurance that I would transmit to Paris by the mail of to-day.</p>
                        <p>Accept, sir, the assurance of my high consideration.</p>

                            <p>Mon’r the <hi rend="smallcaps">Consul General</hi>: * * * * * *</p>
                            <p>You have, without doubt, seen in the journals that the governor of
                                Georgia published, towards the close of last month, a proclamation
                                which placed all foreigners in the alternative of enrolling
                                themselves, or leaving the State within ten days time. I went to
                                Milledgeville, but could only obtain from Governor Brown an
                                extension of time in special cases. Most of the French, driven out
                                of Georgia, call aloud to get away from the confederation. Mr.
                                Benjamin, the confederate secretary of war, replies that they can
                                only pass through the blockade, which costs 300 or 400 dollars in
                                gold, or to embark in a French ship-of-war; but none arrives. Why, I
                                know not. The governors of Florida and Alabama have, as well as
                                Governor Brown, recently ordered foreigners to enroll themselves or
                                leave the State. It seems to be feared that the governor of South
                                Carolina may imitate their example. I received yesterday a petition,
                                signed by thirty-three French subjects, to beg me to get them away
                                from the confederacy. They are furious, and complain that the French
                                government does nothing for them. I will be much obliged to you to
                                bring these different facts to the knowledge of those in proper
                                quarters.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General</hi>: The correspondence of Colonel Day,
                                in relation to the Mexican force under Cortinas, has been received.
                                Colonel Day’s action, so far as it is known here, accords with our
                                neutral obligations, and is approved. The Mexican refugees are
                                entitled to an asylum in our territory when they deliver up their
                                arms and munitions, and restore any prisoners or booty that they may
                                have taken from the French.</p>
                            <p>They will not be received into the service of the United States for
                                service on the Rio Grande frontier, but may be enlisted for the
                                general service. In this case they will be sent to this city, either
                                before or after enlistment, to be organized, armed, and equipped.
                                Their enlistment may be for one, two, or three years, but preferably
                                for the shorter term, and their duty thereafter will be determined
                                by the circumstances of the service.</p>
                            <p>As an armed enemy of France, this force will not be tolerated in our
                                territory, and if this be the intention of Cortinas, the commanding
                                officer will be instructed to regard, and, as far as his power
                                extends, to treat his force as enemies of the United States.</p>
                            <p>You will please instruct Colonel Day, or the commander at Brazos
                                Santiago, accordingly, and in the contingency of any of Cortinas’s
                                force entering our service, give the necessary instructions in
                                relation to enlistment, transfer to <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246"
                                    facs="0266"/>this city, and the disposition to be made of
                                private property. The public property of the Mexican, government
                                remains, of course, in the custody of the United States until
                                disposed of by proper authority.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major</hi>: I have the honor to transmit the
                                following report of affairs at this post:</p>
                            <p>Everything has been quiet since the date of my last report—the enemy
                                not having been seen. I have received information from Mr. Pierce,
                                consul at Matamoras, also from other sources, that the rebels are
                                greatly disappointed at the turn which Mexican affairs have taken at
                                Matamoras. They had expected that they would be able to purchase, or
                                by some means obtain possession of a part of the artillery, which
                                was at that place, from Cortinas. The surrender of Cortinas to
                                Mejia, and his acknowledgment of the authority of Maximilian, of
                                course, destroyed all such anticipations. I have understood that
                                many tempting proposals were made by Eord to Cortinas, with a view
                                to obtain part of the artillery, all of which were steadily
                                refused.</p>
                            <p>On the 29th of September Mejia took possession of Matamoras, in the
                                following terms: No French were to be allowed to enter the city, and
                                all French troops were to leave Bagdad, and the surrender made to
                                Mexican troops alone. These terms were carried out. The French
                                troops at Bagdad have been withdrawn to their vessels, and the place
                                occupied by Mexican forces. I am unable to determine whether this
                                state of affairs is favorable to the interests of the United States
                                or not. I have been informed by some Mexican refugees, lately from
                                Matamoras, that a confederate flag was flying at that place, and
                                that confederate officers are received with great cordiality on the
                                part of Mejia. The instructions received by me through the
                                department headquarters, with regard to Mexican refugees, have been
                                carried out. The refugees appear to be very well pleased with the
                                manner in which they have been treated, and many are enlisting in
                                the United States service for the period of one year. All the
                                officers, and most of the men, however, have a desire to return to
                                their homes as peaceable citizens of Mexico, and I anticipate a
                                request from Mejia that they be allowed to do so. If such a request
                                be made, I shall allow them to return unarmed, on condition that we
                                secure some remuneration for the subsistence furnished.</p>
                            <p>The health of the troops under my command is steadily improving, and
                                I am confident that ere long all symptoms of scurvy will
                                disappear.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received the copy of the report
                            addressed to Major General Banks by Major General Canby, which you did
                            me the honor to send me the day before yesterday, and thank you for the
                            communication.</p>
                        <p>It appears to me, from reading this document and accompanying papers,
                            that while recognizing and understanding from the outset what duties
                            neutrality imposed on them, the military authorities of the Gulf have
                            not, however, entirely resisted the application made by refugee Mexicans
                            to be admitted into the army of the United States. It might even be
                            inferred from the report of Colonel Day and Major George B. Drake, dated
                            September 14, that the first idea of this enlistment came from him, and
                            that it had been suggested to them by his orders. On his part, Major
                            General Canby, thinking to remove all inconvenience by bringing to New
                            Orleans these refugees, who are held under arms, has only succeeded in
                            opening the way for greater difficulty.</p>
                        <p>New Orleans is (your excellency is not ignorant of the fact) the place
                            where are prepared, and from which depart, clandestine expeditions bound
                            for Mexico, which the United States government has been obliged to
                            arrest not long since; no place could, therefore, be more ill chosen to
                            keep together a body of Mexicans transformed into United States
                            soldiers. The succor the federal government will derive from such
                            recruits is, to my mind, problematical; the embarrassments they may
                            occasion are much more plain.</p>
                        <p>I doubt not your excellency may be struck with these remarks, which the
                            government of the Emperor has offered on its part to the envoy of the
                            United States at Paris, and I am gratified to hope that you will advise
                            the adoption, by the military commander in the Gulf, of measures which
                            can give no room for any objection.</p>
                        <p>Accept, sir, the assurance of my high consideration,</p>

                                    War, under date of August 29, 1864, covering translation of a
                                    communication received at Washington by the representative of
                                    the Emperor of the French, in regard to certain occurrences said
                                    to have taken place on the Rio Grande, and which has been
                                    referred to me for report, has been received. There is nothing
                                    specific in the charges or statements made upon which to make a
                                    detailed report.</p>
                                <p>With reference to the great number of federals said to have
                                    crossed to Matamoras after the evacuation of Brownsville, I
                                    would state that there were not six citizens of the United
                                    States left in Brownsville when I withdrew the troops from that
                                    place. I had sent all persons, men, women, and children, to New
                                    Orleans. Some few Mexicans, who had been living on the east side
                                    of the Rio Grande, may probably have crossed into Mexico, but I
                                    know the number must have been small, for I had previously
                                    shipped a great majority of even the Mexicans to New Orleans; I
                                    mean such as resided on our side of the river. I have been
                                    constantly in receipt of advices from Matamoras since the
                                    evacuation of Brownsville, and had such occurrences as the above
                                    taken place I would certainly have heard something of it.</p>
                                <p>With reference to the arms and ammunition said to have gone into
                                    Mexico from American territory, I would undertake to say, in the
                                    most positive manner, that nothing of the kind took place from
                                    January 1, 1864, to August 1, 1864, the period of my
                                    administration on the Rio Grande; nor did anything occur that
                                    would warrant even a rumor of such a thing.</p>
                                <p>It seems to me that when such charges are made, involving, as
                                    they do, the reputation of officers of the United States army,
                                    some kind of proof should accompany the charges; but these
                                    statements being so general I can do nothing more than make a
                                    mere denial of the whole.</p>
                                <p>There is neither truth in the report nor ground for it.</p>
                                <p>I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received the note which you did me
                            the honor to address to me on the 27th, and in which you announce to me
                            that Lieutenant General Grant makes no objection to French subjects who
                            reside in the insurgent States passing his lines to go and embark at
                            City Point. I have made communication of this to Admiral Reynaud, who
                            replies that he is going to send to James river a light-draught vessel
                            of his division, the Adonis, which may be able to ascend a little higher
                            than City Point, up to Eyken or Aiken landing, where the usual exchange
                            of flags of truce is made.</p>
                        <p>The Adonis will receive there our French subjects and their families, and
                            will take them down the river, where another and larger vessel-of-war
                            will be stationed to receive them. If this arrangement is, as I hope it
                            may be, accepted by your excellency, I shall ask that orders may be
                            given immediately, so that his Majesty’s despatch-boat shall encounter
                            no hindrance on her route along James river. It should also be well
                            understood that the Adonis should make as many trips as should be
                            necessary, so that all his Majesty’s subjects who wish to emigrate may
                            use this facility.</p>
                        <p>In thanking your excellency for the friendly dispositions you exhibit in
                            regard to this affair, I seize this occasion to renew to you the
                            assurances of my high consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It would appear, agreeably to the
                            information which has reached the government of the Emperor from various
                            quarters, that ex-President Juarez has not abandoned the project of
                            issuing letters of marque against our <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251"
                                facs="0271"/>commerce, and that there are being constructed in the
                            ports of the United States, especially at New Orleans and at San
                            Francisco, vessels destined to cruise for his account.</p>
                        <p>I bring this fact to the knowledge of your excellency, not supposing,
                            however, that the federal government, had it learned it from another
                            source, would not have immediately taken measures to prevent the
                            departure of these vessels, which is announced as very near at hand.</p>
                        <p>If, however, the good faith of the authorities of the United States being
                            overreached, these vessels should take the sea, I must inform you that
                            the government of his Majesty could not, in any case, recognize in them
                            the character of privateer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Juarez cannot hereafter be seriously considered a chief of a
                            government. The supreme authority in Mexico has no longer at this time,
                            and for those who are the least impartial, any other real representative
                            than the sovereign called by events to the head of that country. Mr.
                            Juarez, whatever may have been his former position, has, therefore,
                            to-day, neither the title nor the character to issue letters of marque.
                            Those with which he should attempt to supply American or other vessels,
                            being henceforth without value, would expose these vessels and their
                            crews to be treated purely and simply as pirates.</p>
                        <p>In instructing me to make this declaration to your excellency, the
                            government of his Majesty has, nevertheless, no other intention than

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 12th nstant, by which I am informed that the
                            imperial government of France has earned from various quarters that the
                            president of the United States of Mexico by you described as
                            ex-president) has not abandoned the project of issuing etters of marque
                            against French commerce, and that there are being constructed <pb
                                n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0272"/>in the ports of the United
                            States, especially at New Orleans and at San Francisco, vessels designed
                            to cruise for his account.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I am at liberty to inform you that this government has no
                            knowledge of the design which is thus ascribed to the president of
                            Mexico, nor has it any information that any such vessels are building,
                            as is supposed, in either of the two ports you have specially
                            designated, or in any other port of the United States. The vigilance of
                            public officers is such as to inspire a confident belief that the
                            information which the Emperor’s government has received is erroneous.
                            Nevertheless, for greater security of the present neutrality of the
                            United States, that information will be specially submitted to the
                            proper agents in New Orleans and San Francisco, with renewed injunctions
                            for the discovery and prevention of the arming or fitting out of
                            vessels-of-war to depredate on French commerce. Similar proceedings will
                            be adopted in relation to other ports upon my receiving any information
                            of unlawful designs or enterprises afoot therein.</p>
                        <p>It seems unnecessary to discuss the question you have raised, whether the
                            president of Mexico has a right, by the law of nations, to grant letters
                            of marque, inasmuch as this government peremptorily exacts perfect
                            neutrality from citizens of the United States in the Mexican war.</p>
                        <p>Accept, sir, a renewed assurance of my high consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that on the
                            3d of September last a translation of the memorandum and of the
                            accompanying invoice, received at this department from the legation of
                            France, on the 2d of that month, in relation to a fraudulent shipment of
                            arms at San Francisco, California, which arms are said to have been
                            destined for Mexico, was transmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury,
                            who was requested to cause the matter to be investigated with a view to
                            the adoption of proper proceedings in the premises.</p>
                        <p>It now appears as the result of the investigation, that early in August
                            last the collector of customs at San Francisco was informed that the
                            American schooner Haze, of about forty tons burden, had on board a
                            quantity of arms, supposed to be four thousand stand, together with a
                            large supply of munitions of war, soldiers’ clothing, and other
                            articles, and that she was moving from place to place, in the bay of San
                            Francisco, apparently seeking an opportunity to evade the vigilance of
                            the revenue cutter Joseph Lane, then on guard duty in that harbor, and
                            get to sea, when she would transfer her cargo to the schooner San Diego,
                            of about fifty-five tons burden. The collector thereupon immediately
                            despatched two boats under the direction of Lieutenant Selden, the
                            commander of the revenue cutter there, with a guard furnished by
                            Brigadier General Mason, the provost marshal at San Francisco, in quest
                            of the Haze. These boats returned on the 4th of August, after a
                            fruitless search of twenty-four hours. At 9 o’clock of the evening of
                            that day the collector was informed that a schooner resembling the Haze
                            had been seen at anchor in Half Moon bay, about thirty-five miles south
                            of the Golden Gate.</p>
                        <p>The San Diego having sailed on that day, pursued by the revenue cutter
                            Joseph Lane, in obedience to the collector’s orders, under the belief
                            that the vessel reported as having been seen at the Half Moon bay was
                            the Haze, he immediately despatched the steam-tug Merrimac, under the
                            command of a revenue <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0274"/>officer,
                            with a guard from the provost marshal’s office, in pursuit. They found
                            the Haze at the place designated, with the arms, munitions of war, and
                            soldiers’ clothing on board. Having ordered her to be detained, the
                            collector reported such detention to Major General McDowell, the
                            commander of the military district in which San Francisco is situated,
                            to whom the arms and munitions of war were delivered.</p>
                        <p>From this statement of facts you will clearly perceive that none of the
                            arms referred to were exported from San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>Accept, sir, a renewed assurance of my very high consideration.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am informed by a merchant, who is
                                largely concerned in the importation and sale of English war
                                materials, that certain shipbuilders in England have solicited and
                                obtained from parties in this city a number of orders for war
                                vessels, with the intention of using them [the orders] as proof of
                                [pretended legitimate] destination, in case the British government
                                should enforce the foreign enlistment act against the steamers now
                                building for the confederate service. I suppose that you are
                                constantly informed of everything ordered in England for his
                                imperial Majesty’s government, and as no one else can make use of a
                                war vessel, the fraud can be easily detected.</p>
                            <p>I have also heard a rumor that two more steamers are about to be sold
                                here for blockade-running or privateering, but as yet I have not
                                been able to trace it to any reliable source.</p>

                        <p>When I reached Europe, finding the navy, so potent at home, would prove
                            our greatest defence against, foreign intervention, I devoted most of my
                                <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0276"/>correspondence with the
                            department, during my first mission to this court, to its development.
                            It is now admitted on all sides that our success in iron-clads and big
                            guns, has, so far, saved us from European assault. I flatter myself that
                            my labors were not all fruitless in aid of such results, and I am
                            encouraged to pursue the subject further. I enclose you an article from
                            the London Times of October 26, 1863, styled “Mr. John Laird, M. P.,
                            upon National Defences,” which I make a part of this despatch. It is a
                            speech of that notorious ship-builder and “canny Scot,” delivered at
                            Birkenhead. Its avowals may be of service both to yourself and to the
                            Navy Department. Some of these admissions, coming from so competent a
                            ship-builder, are worthy of notice. He says,</p>
                        <p>“We have only two ships, that I can find on looking over the navy list,
                            that could possibly be considered suitable for coast defences; and those
                            two vessels are constructed upon Mr. Reed’s plan. Why they are not
                            brought forward I cannot pretend to say—but I do believe this, that the
                            money wasted in the naval administration of this country is something
                            fearful. We have spent <hi rend="italic">£</hi>30,000,000 sterling to
                                <hi rend="italic">£</hi>33,000,000 in the last three years, and got
                            a number of large ships afloat, some of which you saw in the river the
                            other day, and others are building but not ready, and none of which will
                            be of any use to us to carry on a war, in the circumstances in which we
                            shall be most probably placed. I have stated these facts distinctly,
                            [hear, hear.] I have stated them in my place in the House of Commons,
                            [hear, hear,] and I have no fear of their being heard by anybody in any
                            place, because I can prove them to be correct.” These are strong
                            admissions, from which you will draw your own conclusions. I call your
                            attention to the expression, “a number of large ships,” in this extract,
                            because, from the beginning, I have protested against wasting time and
                            money in building large ships. That ever has, I believe, been avoided by
                            the Navy Department. Our small ships, armed with a few heavy guns, as
                            proved in the case of the “Monitor” and “Merrimac,” and in the late
                            victory of the “Weehawken” over the “Atlanta,” are a match for these
                            leviathans of France and England, which have cost so much in time and
                            money. Whilst we must, no doubt, increase our sea-going ships in size,
                            over those which have been designed for harbor and coast service, I
                            still maintain that, having regard <hi rend="italic">to speed, to
                                capacity for fuel, to impenetrable armor,</hi> and a few <hi
                                rend="italic">heaviest guns,</hi> which science shall develop, <hi
                                rend="italic">extra size</hi> is to be avoided: because it takes
                            more time and money to build large ships; because they can be used only
                            at sea, and are unfit for coast service, in offence or defence; because
                            they are more difficult to manage, and more liable to get out of order;
                            because they are subject to greater loss in capture and shipwreck;
                            because, in the search after the enemy, a few small ships are more
                            likely to find him than one large one; and lastly, because the rapid
                            advance in gunnery and iron-mailing warn us not to make large outlays
                            to-day in vessels which may prove worthless to-morrow. I admit the time
                            may come when projectiles will have reached their maximum in force, and
                            the powers of offence and defence will have been perhaps equalized, and
                            when the aggregate metal in the single discharge of a broadside may
                            determine success, as is now the case with wooden ships. Then size will
                            become an important element; but until that time does come, if ever, I
                            think the rules I have laid down are based on reason and the laws of
                            nature.</p>
                        <p>I have given this subject much reflection, and have studiously watched
                            all the experiments in ship-building and armors which were accessible. I
                            may be often in error, yet I trust I have sometimes hit upon truths,
                            which will be of use to the government in building our navy, which is
                            destined to play an important part in the history of the nations.</p>

                            <p>P. S.—In the late trial of the ships-of-the-line the “Magenta” and
                                “Solferino,” and the frigates “Normandie,” “Invincible,” and
                                “Couronne,” all iron-clad steamers, the port-holes of the
                                “Normandie” were closed against the waves, and the ship, in
                                consequence, rendered defenceless. Hereupon the “Solferino” and
                                “Magenta” were subjects of congratulation because of their double
                                tiers of guns, the upper one being used when the rough sea rendered
                                the lower one useless. Now, to my mind, tin’s experiment is all in
                                favor of low hulls, and ball-proof towers, which can be used at all
                                times. What further do we see? The immense extent of plating on
                                these two-deckers made it necessary to leave the stems and sterns
                                unclad. I should say, leave off the upper tier, reduce the number of
                                guns, and put their weight in entire mailing, and heavier metal. I
                                have no data of the size of the guns, but it is stated that the
                                “Normandie “and “Invincible” are armed with rifle guns of 30 pounds
                                calibre. What would such shot do against our better clad and heavier
                                armed monitors? The “Solferino “and “Magenta “carry 50 guns each,
                                size not named. They are armed with “iron spurs,” 4 feet under
                                water, and weighing 15 tons each. I believe the “Weehawken “will
                                sink either of them with ease.</p>

                            <p>The chairman, after some remarks upon the constitution of the
                                volunteer force, addressed the meeting as follows: Having said this
                                much, I may, perhaps, be now allowed to go into the question of the
                                defences of the country. The army and navy, everybody admits, so far
                                as the <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> goes, is kept in the highest
                                possible state of efficiency. In proof of that I need only call your
                                attention to the character, conduct, and known abilities of the
                                officers of the channel fleet, which lately visited this river.
                                [Cheers.] I have had opportunities for years—nay, all my life, in
                                fact—to meet naval men; but I must say I never met a set of men
                                better adapted to fill the position they were placed in than the men
                                who were here with the channel fleet; and I feel convinced that, if
                                provided with proper means, they will fulfil their duty to the
                                country. [Cheers.] Gentlemen, in the last session of Parliament, and
                                in the session before that, great attention was paid, not only to
                                the army and navy, but also to the way in which that army and navy
                                should be armed—the sort of rifles and the sort of guns that they
                                should use. A great deal of discussion took place about the
                                Armstrong gun; and so much was said about the millions it had cost,
                                and about the wasteful expenditure upon it, that I really thought
                                the gentlemen who made those remarks in the House of Commons were
                                giving expression to mere figures of speech rather than to anything
                                else. But the statements were made again and again. They were
                                repeated day after day, and week after week, until a committee was
                                appointed to inquire into the merits of the Armstrong gun, its cost
                                and its efficiency. I was appointed to act on that committee, and
                                rather hard work it was, sitting for two or three hours a day for
                                two or three days a <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0278"/>week
                                through two sessions of Parliament. And I am bound to say, having
                                sat on that committee during the session of 1862 and 1863, I was
                                satisfied that practically 62,500,000 had been spent on that gun,
                                and that we had not got value for our money. [Hear.] And why did we
                                not get value? Because I believe the appointment of Sir William
                                Armstrong an injudicious appointment. He was appointed
                                engineer-in-chief of rifled ordnance, and, of course, thought his
                                own guns were the best that could be constructed; and, therefore, as
                                an honorable man, he was bound to endeavor to carry out his own
                                principle; but he did it with a bad result to the country, because,
                                by being placed in that position, I believe men like Whitworth, and
                                Blakeley, and others, who have invented guns and have done much for
                                the scientific development of the gunnery question, were kept back.
                                I don’t mean to impute anything to Sir William Armstrong, but I say
                                his was an unfortunate appointment on the part of the government,
                                [hear, hear,] and my opinion is that such a post should be opened up
                                to the country generally—to the men of scientific knowledge in the
                                country generally; and that in scientific matters of this kind you
                                should endeavour to bring to bear all the best” and most perfect
                                knowledge in the empire. If you do that, it strikes me as a
                                self-evident proposition that you are more likely to get the best
                                invention than you would do if you confined yourself to the
                                invention of merely one man. [Applause.] Sir William Armstrong
                                started the Elswick Ordnance Company. When he was appointed the
                                engineer-in-chief of ordnance he retired, but his partners carried
                                on the business, and they had a large amount of work, amounting to
                                one million of money, in three or four years to do for government,
                                the government spending the other million and a half. Many
                                statements were made in the committee, and very much evidence was
                                taken. Mr. Whiffin, the accountant general, was called, and proved
                                that, had the work done by the Elswick Ordnance Company been done in
                                the gun factory at Woolwich, the country would have saved, on an
                                expenditure of <hi rend="italic">£</hi>600,000, no less a sum than
                                    <hi rend="italic">£</hi>240,000; so that we may calculate what a
                                saving would have been effected if you reflect for a moment that the
                                amount spent was <hi rend="italic">£</hi>1,000,000, and the work
                                might have been done at Woolwich. I will candidly admit that there
                                was a difference of opinion upon that point, but my argument in the
                                committee was that Mr. Whiffin was called, as the accountant
                                general, to verify the accounts presented to the committee. And who
                                is Mr. Whiffin? it may be asked. Well, he is a man appointed by the
                                government to go to India and put the accounts of the army and the
                                departments in India on a proper and sound basis. If he was an unfit
                                or improper man to be put in that position, we must take it for
                                granted that his evidence before the select committee on ordnance
                                was incorrect; and if he gave evidence that was incorrect, then the
                                government should not have sent him on that mission to India. I
                                believe there has been a large expenditure on these Armstrong guns
                                which might have been avoided. But I will not give you merely my own
                                opinion; I will give you that of his grace the Duke of Somerset, who
                                was himself examined upon this committee, as to the efficiency of
                                the Armstrong gun after all this enormous expenditure had been
                                incurred. The Duke of Somerset, in reply to question 5,012, said:
                                “We had a report that the Armstrong gun had the greatest range and
                                the greatest power of penetration of any gun tried; when we came to
                                try it ourselves that was not confirmed by the facts. The Armstrong
                                gun, at a great distance, may have had greater power of penetration,
                                but for naval purposes, at 200 yards, it certainly had not the
                                greatest power. Our old 68-pounder is a more powerful gun than the
                                100-pounder Armstrong gun.” This was evidence given after they had
                                been at work for five years, and spent two and a half millions of
                                money. Then, again, the noble duke goes on to say, that a 68-pounder
                                gun, of the old style, struck a harder blow at short range than the
                                100-pounder Armstrong gun. His grace said, in reply to question 5,
                                108: “I thought it so much an advantage to have a 70-pounder gun
                                that could throw a 100lb. shot that I considered it probable <pb
                                    n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0279"/>that the armament of the
                                Warrior would have been all 100-pounders; and it was not until we
                                tried a 100-pounder and a 68-pounder against Captain Cole’s cupola
                                that I became aware that the 68-pounder struck a harder blow than
                                the 100-pounder at short range.” Other statements were made by the
                                noble duke and other parties, with which I need not trouble you; but
                                I have thought it right to go briefly into this question, because at
                                this moment it excites considerable interest. America has guns of
                                very great power, and of very great size; and every naval officer
                                with whom I have conversed has told me that in naval wars battles
                                will be fought at close quarters; that the ship that can deliver the
                                hardest blows at 200 yards will be the most efficient ship; and the
                                Duke of Somerset, as you have already heard, has stated that at
                                short ranges the old 68-pounder is more efficient than the
                                100-pounder Armstrong gun. I do not say that the 68-pounder is the
                                most efficient gun that we can get; but public attention has very
                                properly been drawn to this subject, and the next thing that we must
                                do is to see how, in regard to naval guns of increased size and
                                power, we can work them on board ship. Perhaps it may be said that I
                                should apologize for going into these matters, but I, for one,
                                believe that the volunteer movement is an essential part of the
                                defences of the country; and that unless the army, the navy, and
                                volunteers are properly armed and equipped we cannot expect
                                adequately to defend the country, and, as we ought to do, carry the
                                war into the enemy’s camp, which is the proper way of punishing
                                intruders. [Hear, hear.] If we are to go into this question of large
                                guns which has been talked of so much, and which has been looked
                                after, not only with great interest in this country, but with more
                                than usual interest in America—if we are to adopt those guns, we can
                                only do so by resorting to the cupola plan of Captain Coles to work
                                them. I believe that by that plan we can work the largest and the
                                heaviest guns. I know we can work guns of from 15 to 20 tons with
                                the greatest possible ease. We cannot do that on board a broadside
                                ship, and if our battles are to be fought and won by ships with the
                                heaviest armament, the sooner we consider the question of the ships
                                best calculated to carry those heavy guns the better it will be for
                                the country. What have we done on this subject? The cupola, I should
                                tell you, if you do not already know it, stands in the middle of the
                                ship, and you can strengthen a vessel to carry a cupola of any
                                weight. You can armor-plate a cupola to any thickness—12 or 15
                                inches, and you can make it perfectly impenetrable to shot; and, as
                                it is a very small portion of a very large ship, you won’t depress
                                the ship much in the water, but the battery will be well protected
                                and impervious to shot. That, you will see, is a very great point.
                                But what has our government done with regard to this plan? There are
                                two plans now before the public. One is that of Captain Coles; the
                                other is the plan of Mr. Reed. Now, it is quite clear to naval men
                                that, if either of these plans is to supersede the old broadside
                                system of gunnery, the sooner either one or the other, or both, are
                                tried, the better. But again, I ask, what has our government done?
                                In April or May, 1862, they stated in the House of Commons, after
                                various remonstances, that the Royal Sovereign had been ordered to
                                be cut down to be fitted with Coles’s cupola, and that another was
                                to be converted on Mr. Reed’s plan. I venture to say that if proper
                                exertions had been used those two ships might have been ready in six
                                months from April last, [hear, hear,] and I don’t believe they will
                                either of them be ready for six months to come. In the mean time a
                                large amount of money has been expended in other ways; and if these
                                plans of Reed and Coles should prove to be the best, we shall have
                                wasted some millions of money on ships of another construction. If
                                we were to go to war to-morrow our navy is not—I say it advisedly—in
                                such a state as that we could go to war with a certainty of suceess.
                                How do we stand with regard to iron-plated ships? If we were to go
                                to war with America, they have a number of iron-clad turret ships
                                perfectly fitted in every respect for coast defence, while we have
                                no ships at all that are suited for <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260"
                                    facs="0280"/>the purpose. It will not do to say, as we did
                                during the Russian war, that we can build 150 or 200 gunboats, by
                                means of private yards, in twelve months. Armor-plated ships require
                                a length of time in their construction, and I say most emphatically,
                                that it would be the best policy of this country if the legislature
                                would turn its attention to this question; because, although the
                                fleet that we saw in the Mersey the other day was composed of most
                                magnificent ships— most of them drawing from 25 to 28 feet of
                                water—I need scarcely tell you who know anything of the port of
                                Liverpool that they are perfectly unfit for war on the coasts of
                                France or America. [Hear, hear.] If we went to war to-morrow, we
                                should go into that war for the first year or two under most
                                disadvantageous circumstances, and then we should have to turn our
                                dock-yards and our private yards to some account—in fact, to do
                                something to get us out of the scrape in which we should find
                                ourselves, as we had to do during the Russian war, because, if in
                                that war we had had a sufficient number of efficient gunboats, which
                                we had not until the second year of the war, we would have put an
                                end to that conflict much more rapidly than we did, and at a far
                                less cost to this country. I think it right to impress this point
                                particularly upon the meeting. We have only two ships that I can
                                find on looking over the navy list that could possibly be considered
                                suitable for coast defences, and those are two vessels constructed
                                on Mr. Reed’s plan. Why they are not brought forward I cannot
                                pretend to say; but I do believe this, that the money wasted in the
                                naval administration of this country is something fearful. We have
                                spent from <hi rend="italic">£</hi>30,000,000 to <hi rend="italic"
                                    >£</hi>33,000,000 sterling in the last three years, and got a
                                number of large ships afloat, some of which you saw in the river the
                                other day, and others are building, but not ready, and none of which
                                will be of any use to us to carry on a war in the circumstances in
                                which we shall most probably be placed. I state these facts
                                distinctly. [Hear, hear.] I have stated them in my place in the
                                House of Commons, [hear, hear,] and I have no fear of their being
                                heard by anybody in any place, because I can prove them to be
                                correct. I assert, then, that there are only two ships capable of
                                application to coast and harbor defences; and that the two ships on
                                Captain Coles’s plan draw so much water that they are utterly
                                useless for the purposes they are intended for—namely, the defences
                                of our coasts and harbors; and, moreover, that they are neither
                                masted nor rigged, nor are they fit to be sent across the Atlantic.
                                It is in vain that Captain Coles has protested to our government
                                against this state of things. He has urged them to make those ships
                                serviceable, not only for the defences of our own coasts, but for
                                foreign service. I need not tell any of the many commercial men I
                                see here to-night the difficulties that attend ships of very great
                                draught of water getting into and out of Liverpool. How, then, can
                                ships of that class cruise about our banks? [Hear, hear.] What we
                                want is a number of ships of a certain description of from 8 to 10
                                or 15 feet draught of water; and, unless the government come to do
                                something of that sort before very long, we shall have to spend a
                                large sum of money without being in a position when the time really
                                comes to meet the emergency; and we shall in the end spend
                                considerably more money than would be the case if we considered the
                                question well at the present time. [Hear, hear.] Mr. Cobden has been
                                pleased within the last day or two to make some complimentary
                                remarks about my late firm at Birkenhead. I don’t agree with Mr.
                                Cobden in his conclusions. I don’t think it would do to abandon
                                entirely our government dock-yards; but I do believe it would be
                                desirable to maintain them to a certain extent, while at the same
                                time they should have throughout the country a portion of their work
                                done in private establishments, so that in case of war we would not
                                only have the resources of the national dock-yards to rely upon, but
                                the extensive resources of the private yards, the proprietors of
                                which would understand how to do government work. [Hear, hear.] But
                                we stop progress in this country; and the naval development of this
                                country has come to this, that it is supposed that when a gentleman
                                is <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0281"/>appointed controller of
                                the navy, whatever his antecedents may have been— however
                                respectable he may be, however good a sailor he is—yet he must needs
                                carry all the ship-building brains of the country in his head. What
                                I want is simply this—that the government shall bring to bear, for
                                the interest of the country, all the talent that exists in the
                                country. That is done already by the government in respect of
                                engineering for the navy; and I need not tell you who have turned
                                your attention to the subject that the engineering talent of this
                                country, as exemplified by Penn, by Maudslay, and others of
                                considerable eminence, has been the means of bringing a vast amount
                                of talent and ingenuity to bear in the construction of the most
                                perfect machinery which science could devise for propelling our
                                ships-of-war; and this would not, and could not, have been the case
                                if one man only had been placed at the head of the naval engineering
                                department, and everything left to him. Competition is desirable in
                                all things, but in this case it is desirable extremely for the true
                                interests of the country. I do not want to be personal at all,
                                because I will take the testimony of a certain vessel’s operations.
                                I will take two ships built in this neighborhood— the Alabama and
                                the Florida. [Loud and protracted cheering.] I am not at all
                                ashamed, ladies and gentlemen, to own that my sons designed and
                                built the Alabama. [Renewed cheering.] Nor, I am sure, is the
                                builder of the Florida ashamed to say that he designed and built
                                that ship; but the testimony borne to those vessels is not the
                                testimony of Birkenhead or of Liverpool, or, indeed, of this
                                country; but the testimony comes from America. They are two vessels
                                that have been afloat for some considerable length of time, and they
                                have defied the power of 400 ships. [Cheering.] They have never been
                                caught. [Renewed cheering.] They were designed and built by private
                                individuals; but in this country it is the misfortune of the
                                managers of our marine to imagine that one man, and one man only, is
                                to carry in his head the brains of all the designing talent of the
                                country for building ships. If they had got a little life in the
                                admiralty, then they might have improved on the Alabama and the
                                Florida, and perhaps on other ships. [Laughter.] We have been
                                accustomed to hear of the Americans boasting about their
                                ship-building, and that they built ships to run twenty miles an
                                hour. Ladies and gentlemen, the Alabama goes thirteen, but the
                                Americans have never been able to touch her. I certainly do not
                                agree with Mr. Cobden that we should rely on private interests
                                alone. I think the government should do in respect to ship-building
                                as they have done with regard to engineering. As I have told you, I
                                was a member of the committee for two sessions on the Armstrong gun,
                                and that committee recommended, and carried their recommendation,
                                that the inventions of all able men should be properly considered.
                                That was a great step in the right direction, [“hear, hear,” and
                                applause;] and, no doubt, our gunnery will be very much advanced in
                                the future in consequence. [Hear, hear.] I may, perhaps, be tiring
                                the audience, [cries of “No, no,” and cheers;] but when I was asked
                                to come here I did not come here merely to talk about the
                                volunteers. My intention was to speak on the general defences of the
                                country; and, therefore, I now want to state, as shortly as I can,
                                my views on some points connected with that matter. [Cheers.] You
                                have had this point repeatedly stated in the House of Commons, and
                                it is one which is of lasting importance, and that is the question
                                of dock accommodation for ships of the royal navy. [Hear, hear.]
                                Many gentlemen here, no doubt, are connected with the trade of
                                Liverpool; and I will just tell you now what is the position of the
                                royal dock-yards as compared with Liverpool, and then make a few
                                remarks on that point. Liverpool and Birkenhead have 400 acres of
                                dock space, and 28 graving docks. The whole of her Majesty’s
                                dock-yards, including Chatham, Sheerness, Portsmouth, Plymouth, and
                                other places, have only 41 acres of dock space, and the number of
                                graving docks is 33, but only four or five of them are capable of
                                takkig in shipe like the Warrior. In the Mersey, the other day, that
                                fleet looked nothing at all; but we have seen tha <pb n="262"
                                    xml:id="pg_262" facs="0282"/>at the time they got back to the
                                south one part was obliged to go to Plymouth, and another to
                                Portsmouth, and Portsmouth harbor would not take them all in. Why,
                                the admiral told me himself that he was alarmed at the very idea of
                                coming up the Mersey; but he got into the Mersey, and he got out of
                                it again, as safely as we could do, and as we did do every day in
                                the year, with very large merchant ships. [Hear, hear.] Now, every
                                householder in Birkenhead pays taxes; and therefore, being
                                taxpayers, they are all interested in where the money goes. I’ll
                                explain to you where some of it goes. Supposing, instead of 400
                                acres of dock space on the Mersey, we had only 40 acres, and that we
                                had to do the greater portion of our business on the Mersey;
                                supposing we had to take cargoes out of ships into flats, take them
                                ashore, take goods on board again from the shore and carry them on
                                board the ships in flats, and that every single piece of work on
                                board the ship in the river would have to be done by workmen going
                                from the shore, doing the work in the river, and coming back again
                                on shore; why, need I tell any commercial man who knows anything of
                                the trade of Liverpool that with such a system as this, Liverpool
                                would never have gone on at all? Bristol, or London, or some other
                                port would inevitably have taken the trade; because the working of
                                ships here would have been so dreadfully expensive and so ruinous
                                that the port would have been shut up as a port and its trade
                                destroyed entirely. Now, just look for a moment at the position of
                                the royal dock-yards. The ships there cannot fit out in the docks,
                                but they fit out in the harbor as far as they can. They go to
                                Spithead, and their stores are taken off to them. A carpenter is
                                sent off. If it is blowing hard he does not get there at all. If he
                                does not get there he loses half a day; and that is just how the
                                money is spent in the dock-yards. [Hear.] I say this to the
                                government and the House of Commons: “We want two or three millions
                                to make perfect accommodation, and if you give us this money now we
                                will save that expenditure in two or three years.” That is what they
                                should do. They ought to have done it before; but they took a
                                contrary step, and in ten years they have spent a million and a half
                                on mere peddling, stupid alterations, without deriving any benefit
                                from them. The first thing is, they increase the length of a dock by
                                ten feet. Then they widen it two or three feet, and next they deepen
                                it a foot or eighteen inches. That is another way in which the money
                                is wasted. Is there any commercial man who has ever had a ship in
                                this river, and has had to discharge, and load, and refit in the
                                river, who does not know that if he had had proper means for
                                discharging his cargo, refitting his ship, and loading his outward
                                cargo in dock, he would not have beaten another man who was
                                compelled to do all these things in the stream? The man who can do
                                all this in dock would beat the man who has to do it in the river in
                                a very short time. [“Hear, hear,” and applause.] Possibly, it may be
                                considered that the country is too great to look into these matters
                                and the expenditure of money; but I say that the true manner in
                                which to manage public business is to manage it as a man manages his
                                own private affairs; and until the government in this country is
                                forced to do something of that kind they may talk about what they
                                will do, but they will never be able to reduce the expenditure which
                                is going on. [“Hear, hear,” and loud applause.] I do not know that I
                                ought to occupy your time any longer, but various statements have
                                been made about a vessel that has attained to some degree of fame. I
                                refer to a vessel well known throughout this country as the Alabama.
                                [Loud and repeated cheering.] I am not ashamed to acknowledge that
                                some of my family have had to do with that ship. Still, some
                                statements have been made about her which should be controverted. I
                                should not have made any remark now, but for the fact that the
                                government of this country have made certain statements and have
                                given certain legal opinions about her, and they have talked about
                                the vessel having escaped. I see my friend Mr. Hind and other
                                gentlemen who are somewhat of sporting men, and well they know what
                                I mean when I say—when the hounds approach a fox <pb n="263"
                                    xml:id="pg_263" facs="0283"/>cover the fox scents the hounds;
                                and when the huntsman comes up to the cover the fox is gone. It is
                                nonsense to talk about the fox escaping or about the Alabama
                                escaping. The Alabama was in dock when she was inspected by very
                                many curious people; and in dock she took on board her coals and her
                                stores. There was no secrecy whatever observed about the ship. She
                                went out of dock at night; and if she wanted to escape, surely the
                                night was a time when she could have escaped. But what was the fact?
                                They were so vainglorious about their litttle craft that they
                                anchored her off the landing-stage, and there she remained until
                                half past ten or eleven the following morning, when she left for her
                                destination. They admit that she was not fitted out as a man-of-war,
                                and that they had no legal authority to detain that ship until a man
                                was engaged to serve on board her as a sailor. Does any ship-owner
                                present believe, or any man connected with shipping, that the
                                captain of a vessel supposed to be going upon any extraordinary
                                voyage would go and tell a man, who appears to have been a hired
                                agent or spy of certain gentlemen in London? Would the captain of a
                                ship on such an expedition go and tell a common sailor, at the
                                Sailors’ Home, all the ins and outs of his intentions regarding that
                                ship? (“Hear, hear,” and applause.] Certainly not. Now, I know it is
                                not true that that man was told anything of the sort by the captain.
                                I have been so informed, and I believe the information to be on the
                                best authority. But let me tell you it is not necessary, in engaging
                                men to go to any part of the world, to tell those men where they are
                                going; because, you know, I am an old hand myself in fitting out
                                secret expeditions. [Laughter and applause.] A few years ago it was
                                thought desirable by the government of this country to send vessels
                                to China and to various parts of India secretly. A Chinese war was
                                anticipated; the Russians were expected to come down the head of the
                                Indus and the Euphrates; and it was desirable to place faith in
                                somebody. Her Majesty’s government were pleased to place faith in
                                me, and I built for the British government about a dozen vessels;
                                but the government said to me, “What we want you to do, Mr. Laird,
                                is this: we want you to build, and to arm, and equip these vessels,
                                and to send them out; they must be yours, and nobody must know
                                anything about it.” Well, being a prudent sort of a ship-builder, I
                                said, “I will take your order on those conditions.” I built the
                                ships; they were armed; I engaged men; I did everything. [“Hear,
                                hear,” cheers, and laughter.] I had to engage, not only sailors, but
                                engineers and boiler-makers, ship-carpenters, and men of a variety
                                of trades; I had to send them to various parts of the world, and I
                                can assure you that a few shillings per month extra did all the
                                business. They did not care where they went so long as they got a
                                little extra pay [laughter;] and, therefore, the statement regarding
                                the captain of the Alabama having told a sailor all about the
                                ship—whose she was, and where she was for— bears the impress of
                                falsehood upon the very face of it. I never saw the captain of the
                                Alabama but once, and that was after having taken the ship out, and
                                I don’t think he was the man to make such a statement as that upon
                                which the ship might have been stopped. Let me read you a few words
                                from a speech of the solicitor general, who made another great
                                speech the other day at Richmond. He said some months ago: “It was
                                not till the Alabama reached the Azores that she received her
                                stores, her captain, or her papers, and that she hoisted the
                                confederate flag. It is not true that she departed from the shores
                                of this country as a ship armed for war.” [“Hear, hear,” and great
                                applause.] And then went on to say: “But I wish the House to
                                understand that in those depositions there was a great mass of
                                hearsay evidence, which, taken by itself, could not form the basis
                                of any action. Of the six depositions transmitted on the 22d of
                                July, only one was good for anything at all—viz., the evidence of a
                                person named Passmore, which was sufficient to prove the material
                                facts. Two more were sent, corroborating Passmore, on the 24th, and
                                were received by Earl Russell on the 26th.” [Hear.] Passmore was the
                                man who made the affidavit <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0284"
                                />that he was told by the captain where the ship was to go. I don’t
                                believe him, and he must have got up the evidence for the occasion.
                                Lord Palmerston, whom we all respect, [applause,] said, on the 27th
                                of March last: “I have myself great doubts whether, if we had seized
                                the Alabama, we should not have been liable to considerable damages.
                                It is generally known that she sailed from this country unarmed, and
                                not properly fitted out for war, and that she received her armament,
                                equipment, and crew in a foreign port. Therefore, whatever
                                suspicions we may have had—and they were well founded, as it
                                afterwards turned out—as to the intended destination of the vessel,
                                her condition at that time would not have justified a seizure.”
                                [Cheers.] Now, here is Lord Palmerston, an old and experienced man,
                                who says, in his opinion, the government would have been liable to
                                considerable damages had they stopped that ship. I think, after what
                                has been said—considering my connexion with this place, and after
                                the noise this vessel has made in the world [laughter and
                                applause]—the meeting will excuse my having brought forward these
                                questions. [Applause.] But the whole question of the defences of
                                this country may be, I think, very safely brought before this
                                meeting, because they are all intimately connected with the
                                volunteer movement; and I therefore feel that I have been justified
                                in going somewhat at length into the various questions as to the
                                character of our ships-of-war, the quality of guns that they are to
                                carry, and other incidental matters. Other speeches have been made
                                by a noble lord who does not seem to agree with Lord Palmerston. I
                                mean Earl Russell. [Hisses.] He made a speech the other day which
                                has caused a great sensation all over the world, and which the
                                Americans say is only due to the coercion they have put upon him.
                                Earl Russell is a man who is well known and respected throughout the
                                country by his own followers; but he is a man of whom Sydney Smith
                                said that he had such confidence in himself that he would take
                                command of the channel fleet, if necessary. Well, I think Earl
                                Russell has undertaken something that he will not be able to carry
                                through quite so easily as, perhaps, he might command the channel
                                fleet. He has undertaken to say in this country that he can do
                                certain things, and that if he finds the law is not sufficient he
                                can go to Parliament for an indemnity. [Hear, hear.] I don’t believe
                                myself that Parliament will ever indemnify any man in the country,
                                however powerful and however great he may be, if he is trying to
                                transgress the law. [Loud and protracted cheering.] At any rate, up
                                to the time that the act of indemnity is passed, there are laws in
                                the land which all of us are bound to obey. [Hear, hear.] Laws are
                                not made for administrations, but for the people of this country,
                                and the people are only bound to obey the law as it stands, and not
                                to obey laws which may possibly come to be passed hereafter.
                                [Renewed cheers.] Another eminent gentleman, Sir Roundell Palmer,
                                has made another speech at Richmond; and I must say, having read
                                that speech, that it is all very well for an eminent lawyer, one of
                                the first legal authorities of the day, to make a speech in the
                                month of March, and say that those were the views of the country,
                                and then to make a speech in support of another client in October of
                                opposite views; but I say it is not the duty of a man who holds the
                                position of a statesman in this country to be placing one
                                interpretation upon certain facts in March and another in October.
                                [Loud cheers.]</p>

                            <p>The official trial of this little craft, which has been fitted by the
                                steam factory department of Portsmouth dock-yard expressly, by order
                                of the admiralty, in order to obtain certain data relative to the
                                merits of the double or turnscrew <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265"
                                    facs="0285"/>system, took place on Monday, in Stake’s bay, near
                                Portsmouth, under the supervision of Mr. John Ward, chief assistant
                                to Mr. Andrew Murray, engineer of Portsmouth yard, and was attended
                                with the most satisfactory results on every point, whether in
                                relation to the speed obtained, powers of turning and manœuvring the
                                vessel with one or both screws, or of steering by the screws alone,
                                without the aid of the rudder. These results have been obtained
                                before to a great extent in the trials of private steamers on the
                                Thames lately fitted on the “twin” screw principle; but the trial of
                                the Experiment at Portsmouth on Monday was the first trial of any
                                vessel fitted on this principle by the admiralty, was their official
                                acknowledgment of the value of a most important discovery in marine
                                propulsion, and was, therefore, attended with a degree of interest
                                beyond what usually attends an ordinary screw trial.</p>
                            <p>The Experiment is a first-class line-of-battle ship’s launch, 42 feet
                                in length, and of proportionate breadth and depth. Her engines and
                                boilers have been made for her according to the designs of Mr.
                                Andrew Murray, the engineer of Portsmouth dock-yard, and are models
                                of workmanship and compactness of form. Boiler and engines occupy a
                                space in the centre of the boat of only 6 feet 11 inches by 4 feet 4
                                inches, the nominal horse-power of the engines being 3, the length
                                of the stroke of piston 6 inches, and the diameter of cylinder 4
                                inches. The total weight of engines and boilers, with platform,
                                coal-boxes, &amp;c., and with boilers fitted, is 2½ tons. The
                                cylinders are brought on to each side of the boiler and drive their
                                independent shafting through each quarter with screws attached to
                                the latter of four blades, each screw having a diameter of 2 feet,
                                and a pitch of 3 feet 4½ inches. The draught of water of the launch,
                                at the commencement of the trial, was 2 feet 6 inches aft, and 1
                                foot 9 inches forward. The launch steamed out of harbor at 10 a. m.
                                against a strong flood tide, and excited considerable surprise in
                                the minds of those on board by the manner in which she ran over the
                                strong adverse tide. The measured mile was reached, and the little
                                vessel was at once placed upon her speed trials, which she
                                accomplished as follows:</p>

                            <p>Mean speed of the six runs, 6·742 knots.</p>
                            <p>The revolutions of the engines averaged 290 at 60lb. pressure of
                                steam, and with that pressure the Experiment will realize a good
                                seven knots. On Monday, from a cause which can be easily remedied in
                                future, the steam, as will be seen by the foregoing figures, could
                                not be kept at 60lb., and consequently the vessel lost in speed,
                                although it was almost impossible for anything to be more
                                satisfactory than the speed she actually attained. Indeed, it has
                                become a question worth noticing, while referring to speed alone,
                                whether by thus dividing the propelling power of a vessel in the
                                substitution of two for a single screw, an additional speed of the
                                ship through the water is not gained. The advocates of the
                                principle, such men as Commanders Symonds and Selwyn, R. N., say
                                that full 20 per cent. is gained. Reverting, however, to the actual
                                results obtained by the trial of the Experiment, on the conclusion
                                of the speed trials the vessel was next tested in making circles as
                                follows: With both engines going ahead at full speed, with the
                                rudder acting, a complete circle was made to starboard in 1 minute 9
                                seconds, and to port in 1 minute 13 seconds. The circle was next
                                made with one engine shut off, and with the port engine standing
                                (the helm still <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0286"/>being
                                brought into use) a circle was made in 1 minute 31 seconds, and with
                                the starboard engine shut off in 1 minute 27 seconds. Reversing the
                                motion of the respective engines, and with the starboard engine
                                going ahead and the port astern, the circle was made in 2 minutes 9
                                seconds. Repeating this experiment, but with the starboard engine
                                astern and port ahead, the circle was made in 1 minute 43 seconds.
                                The diameter of the circles made, as near as could be ascertained
                                without actual measurement, was, with both engines going ahead and
                                rudder acting, rather under three times the length of the launch;
                                with one engine shut off rather over that distance; with engines
                                reversed, and screws, therefore, working opposite ways, the launch
                                turned on a pivot just abaft her centre, and within her own length,
                                gradually working spirally and astern. The foregoing results confirm
                                in a remarkable degree the trials made during the past twelve months
                                on the Thames by Messrs. Dudgeon, of Limehouse, which have attracted
                                so much attention in the naval and scientific world, and which have
                                been attended and officially reported upon for the information of
                                the admiralty by their inspecting engineer afloat, Mr. John Dinnen.
                                The double or twin screw system of propelling ships-of-war has an
                                importance in relation to the future construction of the British
                                navy of which the general public are but little aware. We are now
                                clothing our iron-clads with 5½-inch armor, but if a gun should be,
                                or has been already, adopted by foreign nations that can to a
                                certainty destroy this armor within point-blank range, then we
                                certainly must give our ships an increasing ratio in their means of
                                defence. It is indeed said that we must clothe all ships designed
                                from the present time with 12 in lieu of 5 inches of armor, in order
                                to meet the advantage that has already been gained by guns over our
                                now orthodox 5½ inches. If we must do this we can only do it by the
                                adoption of the double-screw system, which, it is asserted, will
                                carry any given weight at one-third less draught of water than can
                                be done by any vessel driven by a single screw. If we can thus
                                really carry a given weight in our ships-of-war, by simply dividing
                                their propelling power, at one-third a less draught of water, the
                                sooner such a principle is adopted the better, for every one now
                                seems agreed. that our Minotaurs, Agincourts, and Northumberlands
                                will require some eight or nine feet too great a draught of water to
                                be available for any ordinary work on any line of coast. The obvious
                                superiority of the double over the single screw for turning and
                                manœuvring in shallow or narrow waters is already too obvious, after
                                what has already been said, to need any further comment here. In
                                concluding this notice of the Experiment’s official trial, it is,
                                perhaps, necessary to state that the double screw was first employed
                                by the late Sir John Rennie, C. E., in building steam vessels for
                                the Indian rivers. They were 70 feet in length, 7 feet 6 inches in
                                breadth, 3 feet 6 inches in depth, and drew 2 feet of water. They
                                were driven by two screws, each of 2 feet 2 inches diameter and 4
                                feet pitch, by direct-acting disk engines, but their screws were
                                driven by “collective” and not independent engine power. Something
                                of the same kind was followed in three of our iron-cased floating
                                batteries constructed for the Russian war, but it was reserved in
                                this country for Messrs. Dudgeon, of Limehouse, to practically
                                demonstrate the true value of the double-screw system, each screw
                                driven by its own independent engine, for purposes of war as well as
                                of commerce.</p>

                        <p>called upon me in the name of the officers of the navy and said “that he
                            had <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0287"/>been appointed by them to

                            much friendship and courtesy to their comrades in America. That his
                            Majesty, the Emperor, was now absent, but no doubt he would, on his
                            return, make suitable acknowledgments to our government of the amicable
                            reception of his subjects at New York. That the Russian officers had
                            always been gratified to meet those of the American navy, and they
                            should be most happy, should any ships-of-war visit Cronstadt, to
                            reciprocate the late courtesies extended to their countrymen.” I replied
                            that I was gratified to be the medium of the amiable sentiments of the
                            Russian navy expressed towards my countrymen; but that it is they who
                            felt themselves under obligation to the Emperor and people of Russia,
                            that the popular manifestations of respect for the naval officers of
                            Russia were not ordinary courtesies, but the heartfelt gratitude of the
                            whole American people to his Majesty, the Emperor, who is admired for
                            his liberation of the serfs, and loved for his friendly attitude towards
                            the federal Union. * * * *</p>
                        <p>After this formal message and response more intimate reliance between
                            Russia and America was the subject of our mutual aspirations. And the
                            general retired, evidently gratified at the distinguished reception of
                            his compatriots in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Russian reception in American waters is the subject of conversation
                            in all circles, and the gentry and the common people seem alike to
                            understand and feel the friendly demonstration made at this time. * * *

                                obvious to the initiated, should, I think, be corrected, so that
                                full effect may be given to the otherwise accurate statements made
                                respecting the broadside rifled gun used in the French navy. This
                                gun throws a solid shot of 30 kilogrammes, not 30 pounds weight, and

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The French seem to have confined their
                            criticism of their late trial of ships altogether to the supposed
                            superiority of two over one-deckers, in which I dissented from them.
                            Since then other questions have arisen.</p>
                        <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0288"/>
                        <p>1st. Is it better to plate the whole ship, or leaving the ends unclad,
                            thus to make it more seaworthy?</p>
                        <p>2d. Is wooden or iron framing or hacking best?</p>
                        <p>3d. How can the ship be best prevented from fouling?</p>
                        <p>The French frigates, which were entirely iron-clad, suffered more in the
                            gale than the ships-of-the-line, which had the bows and sterns unplated,
                            The River Consort, in a late storm, with wooden backing, and entirely
                            iron-clad, nearly sunk with leakage, whilst the Warrior, with iron
                            backing, rode out the same storm with perfect safety. The Royal Oak, in
                            consequence of the galvanic action of the copper and iron, in three
                            years nearly rusted out near the junction, and still “fouled.” 1. In
                            response to these facts I would say that as sea worthiness is an
                            essential requisite, if the ship won’t bear full armor it must be left
                            off at the ends. In fact, whilst ordnance seems to be superior to the
                            defence, wooden ships already built might be very effectually armed
                            against even ironclads. 2. Iron backing I urged long ago upon the
                            department upon the very fact which is now established by experience.
                            Every bolt and all the metal put upon the iron frame, with proper
                            mechanical arrangement, strengthens the ship against storm and shot,
                            whilst every pound of iron put upon wooden backing weakens the ship in
                            stress of weather. Iron is also preferable because it is more durable
                            than wood, and can be more largely and readily supplied in case of war
                            than wood. 3. The experiments upon copper and iron bottoms need to be
                            further tried. The copper might be insulated from the iron near the
                            water line by gutta-percha, or some other material, and thus the
                            galvanic action might be avoided.</p>
                        <p>To return to iron-framing, it allows false bottoms, double skins, and
                            water-tight bulkheads. The Warrior has a double skin protecting the
                            machinery, and is also divided by eighteen bulkheads into as many
                            water-tight compartments, thus being greatly secured against shot,
                            rocks, icebergs, and stress of weather, and other casualties, and
                            especially fire, for stores in one compartment on fire might be
                            submerged at once by water without injury to other things and other
                            parts of the ship.</p>
                        <p>I have herein enclosed a slip from the London Times of November 6
                            instant, being an article marked “Modern Artillery.” It is a summary of
                            two reports from a committee of the House of Commons, 1862 and 1863, and
                            gives a condensed review of late improvements in English gunnery. I have
                            put it upon a separate sheet, marked “A,” so that if it has not met the
                            eyes of our ordnance department it may be sent them, if deemed worthy of
                            notice.</p>
                        <p>I will only remark that the shells of Sir William Armstrong are worthy of
                            note. I think his method of <hi rend="italic">coiled</hi> iron welded
                            would not be so strong as H. Ames’s method of welded rings. Mr. Ames has
                            a foundry at Falls Village, Connecticut, and our government ought at

                            <p>The art of war, like every other art, has been gradually developed,
                                and has had its periods of stagnation and progression. It has
                                recently made extraordinary advances, especially in the department
                                of artillery, and this was a necessary result of the great
                                improvement in small-arms in range as well as precision. Brown Bess
                                was a capital weapon, and did excellent service in her day. She was
                                a great favorite of the Duke of Wellington, and it was not without
                                reluctance that she was abandoned in favor of the rifle. As soon,
                                however, as this weapon was generally introduced into the service
                                rifled ordnance became a necessity, for it is obvious that if the
                                small-arm exceed artillery in range, the latter must be
                                comparatively useless, as riflemen might then take deliberate aim at
                                the gunners and shoot them down at their posts, while they could
                                make no effectual reply. At the siege of Sebastapol the value of the
                                rifle in this respect was fully exemplified in the ranks of the
                                enemy, as well as in those of the allies. Expedients of various
                                kinds were resorted to with a view to protect the gunner from the
                                deadly aim of the invisible rifleman, but only with very partial
                                success.</p>
                            <p>In obedience to the general law of demand and supply, the want of
                                guns of precision and long range was no sooner felt and expressed
                                than the inventive faculty of the nation was immediately stimulated
                                to the production of ordnance possessing those qualities. Mr.
                                Lancaster was the first to come forward, when in 1853 he proposed
                                his oval-bore system of rifling, which was approved and accepted by
                                the authorities of that day. Machinery was erected at the royal
                                arsenal for rifling large cast-iron guns on this system, and for
                                making the projectiles, but the manufactory did not long continue in
                                operation. According to Colonel Lefroy, the total amount expended on
                                the remuneration of the inventor and buildings, and machinery
                                connected with this invention, did not exceed <hi rend="italic"
                                    >£</hi>25,000. (First report, p. 147.)</p>
                            <p>In the year following appeared Sir William Armstrong, who had
                                previously acquired a solid reputation as a man of science, and had
                                distinguished himself as the author of mechanical inventions of the
                                highest practical value. In December, 1854, Sir William had an
                                interview with the Duke of Newcastle, then secretary of state for
                                war, and proposed the system of artillery which is now designated by
                                his name. The result was “an order for a number of his guns, not
                                exceeding six, for trial.” (First report, p. 156.) The first gun, a
                                3-pounder, was completed in March, 1855, and after having been
                                subjected to a series of experiments was delivered in July of the
                                same year. This gun was not tested by the ordnance select committee
                                of that day until November, when they presented a report which was
                                in the main favorable, and requested to be allowed to submit it to
                                further experiments. The gun was rebored up to a 5-pounder, and in
                                December, 1856, Colonel Eardley Wilmot reported that “at 1,500 and
                                2,000 yards it had made remarkably good practice.” (<hi
                                    rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 156.) There-upon an 18-pounder was
                                ordered, which was completed July 1, 1857, and tried by the ordnance
                                select committee January 26 and 27, 1858. Concerning the results of
                                this trial, Colonel Mitchell, then superintendent of the school of
                                gunnery at Shoeburyness, reported, February 9, as follows:</p>
                            <p>“The very extraordinary powers of range and precision of fire
                                exhibited at Shoeburyness on the 26th and 27th ultimo from a
                                breech-loading gun of Mr. <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0290"
                                />Armstrong’s invention appear to me to afford a reasonable
                                expectation that artillery will not only regain that influence in
                                the field which, to a certain extent, the recent introduction of
                                improved small-arms has deprived it, but that that influence will be
                                most materially increased.” (First report, p. 165.)</p>
                            <p>On the 30th of August, 1858, General Peel, then secretary of state
                                for war, appointed the rifled cannon committee, with instructions to
                                ascertain as speedily as possible the best form of rifled guns for
                                field service then known to the war department. In his evidenee
                                before the committee of the House of Commons General Peel assigns
                                the following as the reasons which led him to take this course, and
                                which are so relevant that we cannot refrain from presenting them
                                nearly <hi rend="italic">in extenso:</hi></p>
                            <p>“2,308. Was it not during your administration that the breech-loading
                                Armstrong gun was adopted into her Majesty’s service?</p>
                            <p>“It was during my administration that that gun was adopted into the
                                service. Shortly after my appointment to the office referred to my
                                attention was naturally directed to the circumstance that we were
                                behind other countries in not having any rifled ordnance in our
                                service, and notwithstanding the very favorable opinion expressed by
                                my predecessor with respect to the results of the trials made with
                                the Armstrong gun, it had not been adopted. I called upon Colonel
                                Lefroy, whom I found occupying in the service the position of
                                scientific adviser to the secretary of state for war, to furnish a
                                report of all the experiments which had been made in rifled
                                ordnance.</p>
                            <p>“2,309. That report is now before the committee, is it not?</p>
                            <p>“That report is now before the committee, but before that report was
                                laid before me I had received what I must say, under the
                                circumstances, appeared an exaggerated account of the results of the
                                trials made at Woolwich with reference to this gun. The Indian
                                government, not waiting for the report of the committee, but in
                                consequence of a report which Lord Stanley had received direct from
                                a very distinguished officer of the Indian artillery, Colonel
                                Willoughby, had applied to the government for a battery of guns. A
                                very distinguished officer, General Brereton, who was then on a
                                committee appointed to decide about shrapnell shells, came to me and
                                stated that from the circumstance of his being at an adjacent butt
                                he had seen the practice with the gun in question, and I think he
                                told me there was nothing in the Arabian Nights half so wonderful as
                                this new gun. The commander in chief came back with an account of
                                the gun almost equally strong, and I believe the words of his royal
                                highness were, that it could do anything but speak. On receiving the
                                report of Colonel Lefroy I adopted the recommendation in that
                                report, and appointed a special committee, in order that they might
                                report to me what was the best rifled gun.” (First report, p.
                                111.).</p>
                            <p>General Peel’s rifled cannon committee reported November 16, 1858,
                                and recommended “the immediate introduction of guns rifled on Mr.
                                Armstrong’s principle for special service in the field.” (First
                                report, p. 167.) This committee has been charged before the ordnance
                                committee of the House of Commons with unfairness, and with undue
                                haste in arriving at its decision; but, after the most searching
                                investigation, these serious charges have been completely rebutted,
                                as appears from the following passage in the committee’s report,
                                1863:</p>
                            <p>“The range and precision of the gun were so vastly superior to all
                                field ordnance known at that time that, after careful and repeated
                                trials, the committee appointed to investigate the question
                                recommended its adoption as the field gun of the service. Your
                                committee are of opinion that the adoption of the Armstrong gun by
                                the secretary of state for war for special service in the field was
                                fully justified.” (Report, p. iv.)</p>
                            <p>The Armstrong system of artillery having been introduced and greatly
                                extended both in the land and sea service, and having encountered
                                strong opposition from various quarters, a committee of the House of
                                Commons, termed the <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0291"/>select
                                committee on ordnance, was appointed, June 20, 1862, “to inquire
                                into the expenditure incurred since the beginning of 1858 on various
                                natures of improved ordnance, whether obtained by contract or
                                manufactured in the public departments, and into the results
                                obtained by such expenditure.” This committee, having been
                                reappointed February 20, 1863, and having sat through two sessions,
                                concluded its labors July 23, 1863. An immense mass of evidence has
                                been collected and published in their two reports, of which the last
                                appeared only a few weeks ago.</p>
                            <p>The country has great reason for satisfaction that such a committee
                                should have been appointed, for it is certain that through its
                                instrumentality the Armstrong system has been subjected to the
                                severest conceivable ordeal. Every possible objection has been urged
                                against it, and that before a tribunal of which the majority was
                                assuredly not prepossessed in its favor. While all the avowed
                                enemies of the system were called upon to give evidence, it is
                                somewhat surprising, however, that artillery officers who have had
                                the largest experience of the working of this gun both at
                                Shoeburyness and in actual service in China should not have been
                                invited to attend. Thus, Colonel Taylor, commandant and
                                superintendent of the school of gunnery at Shoeburyness, and his
                                able assistant, Captain Alderson, might have given most valuable
                                and, to the public, most acceptable testimony, for at Shoeburyness
                                alone 37,000 rounds have been fired from Armstrong guns. (Second
                                report, p. 161.) The same may be also remarked of the artillery
                                officers who served in China, not one of whom was summoned as a
                                witness.</p>
                            <p>We shall now proceed to examine and digest the evidence contained in
                                the reports of the committee, commencing with that relating to the
                                Armstrong system. In the first place we shall adduce the evidence in
                                favor of the system, and in the second place the evidence against
                                it. But it will be necessary to consider apart the subjects of field
                                artillery and large ordnance.</p>
                            <p>The Armstrong field gun—the term “field gun” being applied to guns
                                not exceeding a 12-pounder—is a rifled breech-loader made of
                                wrought-iron, and essentially differs from all guns previously
                                invented, both in the nature of the rifling and in general
                                construction. The rifling consists of a series of shallow spiral
                                grooves extending over the whole internal surface of the barrel in
                                front of the shot chamber; and the projectile is a cylinder of hard
                                metal coated with lead, about twice the length of its diameter,
                                flat-ended posteriorly and rounded off anteriorly. The shot enters
                                easily at the breech, but cannot proceed beyond the commencement of
                                the rifling, except by the yielding of the coat of lead, under the
                                propelling force of the powder. The lead thus readily adapts itself
                                to the grooves, and, as these are spiral, rotary motion is
                                necessarily communicated to the shot. By this simple expedient the
                                shot is, as it were, surrounded with a tight packing, which
                                effectually prevents windage, and therefore tends to render
                                available the whole explosive force of the powder. The breech is
                                closed with a movable vent-piece, which is firmly secured by a
                                powerful and easily adjusted screw. The gun is constructed on what
                                is termed the coil system, and is formed of a series of coiled tubes
                                shrunk over each other. But let us hear Sir William Armstrong’s own
                                description of his original gun, as he communicated it to the
                                ordnance committee:</p>
                            <p>“It was a gun with a steel tube, surrounded with coiled cylinders,
                                similar in every respect to the tubes of gun-barrels. Now, the
                                peculiarity of that gun was not its being merely a built-up gun,
                                because built-up guns are of very ancient date. In fact, I have no
                                doubt that the original construction of all guns was by building up.
                                It was not merely a hooped gun—that is to say, a gun strengthened by
                                rings, because rings give only circumferential strength, and no
                                longitudinal strength; but that gun was peculiar in being mainly
                                composed of tubes, or pipes, or cylinders, formed by coiling
                                spirally long bars of iron into tubes, and welding them upon the
                                edges, as is done in gun-barrels. Now, <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272"
                                    facs="0292"/>whether any one had conceived that idea before is
                                beyond my power to say, but I feel assured that no gun up to that
                                time had been actually made upon that principle. The whole
                                difficulty lay in the making. It is very easy now, with all our
                                knowledge and experience, to define how such coils are to be made;
                                but at that period it was a very difficult matter to accomplish, and
                                it was not until I had made very many unsuccessful attempts that I
                                succeeded in satisfactorily carrying it out.” (Second report, p.
                                133.)</p>
                            <p>It is important not to confound hoops with coiled tubes. The ancient
                                wrought-iron guns were composed of longitudinal bars of iron firmly
                                bound together by hoops, not by coiled tubes, which are a modern
                                invention. Sir William Armstrong lays no claim to originality with
                                regard to the principle of construction of these tubes, but candidly
                                acknowledges that he has simply done on a large scale what had been
                                previously done on a small scale in the case of the barrels of
                                fowling-pieces. It should, however, be borne in mind that the
                                difficulty of manufacture is often directly proportionate to the
                                size of the object; and of this the large coiled tubes furnish a
                                striking example. Those who are practically acquainted with the
                                welding and forging of iron will readily admit that the production
                                of a sound tube of large dimensions on the coil principle is by no
                                means easy, and that the skill necessary to insure success was not
                                likely to be attained except through numerous failures.</p>
                            <p>The general mode of construction of the Armstrong gun is applicable
                                to all guns, whether rifled or smooth-bore, breech-loaders or
                                muzzle-loaders; and, accordingly, in several guns differing much
                                from each other, this mode of construction has been adopted. Hence,
                                no small confusion has arisen in the public mind with respect to the
                                meaning of the term Armstrong gun; and it is therefore necessary to
                                distinguish carefully between general construction and special
                                modifications.</p>
                            <p>What Sir W. Armstrong claims as essential and peculiar to his system
                                of artillery will be learnt from the following part of his evidence
                                before the committee:</p>
                            <p>“3,487. (Major O’Reilly.) You mentioned on the last day of your
                                examination that one of the results which had been obtained by the
                                country had been a system of construction of guns; will you kindly
                                say whether you mean by that the system of strengthening the guns by
                                hoops of wrought-iron, or whether you include the system of
                                constructing the barrel]</p>
                            <p>“I referred to the coil system.</p>
                            <p>“3,488. You referred both to the barrel and the external hoops?</p>
                            <p>“It is applicable to the barrel and to the hoops.</p>
                            <p>“3,489. Then what do you mean by the coil system as applicable to the
                                barrels and the hoops?</p>
                            <p>“The gun with the barrel of steel as exemplified in my first gun, or
                                with the barrel of coil, as in my subsequent guns.</p>
                            <p>“3,490. What is the system of construction which you say the country
                                has gained?</p>
                            <p>“The coil system; but I have made the internal tubes of the gun of
                                both steel and coils. I use the coil as an alternative when steel is
                                not to be obtained.</p>
                            <p>“3,495. * * * * Would you kindly define that further as to its
                                essential part; it consists of polygroove rifling, but the
                                breech-loading is not essential, you say?</p>
                            <p>“The essential part is the construction; I think the mode of rifling
                                is subordinate; the most prominent feature is the construction.</p>
                            <p>“3,496. Then am I right in concluding that the question of the
                                breech-loader or muzzle-loader is not essential in your system?</p>
                            <p>“Yes; neither mode is peculiar to my system. I think that the
                                relative merits of the breech-loader and the muzzle-loader is a very
                                difficult question.</p>
                            <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0293"/>
                            <p>“3,497. Is the question of using soft-coated shot an essential part
                                of the system?</p>
                            <p>“Yes; not the coating, but using a soft material for giving rotation;
                                it may be in the form of a continuous coating, or in the form of
                                studs.</p>
                            <p>“3,498. (Sir John Hay.) A soft bearing?</p>
                            <p>“ Yes, that I do certainly pledge myself to.</p>
                            <p>“3,499. (Major O’Reilly.) Those are the only points which you
                                consider essential?</p>
                            <p>“The essential points are the mode of construction, and, so far as
                                the principle of rifling is concerned, the using of a soft
                                material.” (Second report, p. 161.)</p>
                            <p>It has been alleged that Sir William Armstrong has no claim to the
                                merit of originality in the construction of guns of coiled tubes,
                                and the allegation was carefully investigated by the ordnance
                                committee. Mr. Whitworth, in a letter in the Times of November 8,
                                1862, asserted that “guns built up of welded coiled hoops were well
                                known in this country before he (Sir W. Armstrong) introduced his
                                rifled ordnance.” This letter was subsequently read by the author to
                                the committee, and the following question was put to Mr. Whitworth
                                by Sir John Hay:</p>
                            <p>“1,446. Can you refer the committee to any guns built up of welded
                                coiled hoops before Sir William Armstrong introduced his rifled
                                ordnance?”</p>
                            <p>No answer was given. It should be particularly noticed that the
                                question referred to <hi rend="italic">guns built up of welded
                                    coiled hoops,</hi> which is the identical expression used by Mr.
                                Whitworth in his letter to the Times. Now a single hoop may be
                                described as coiled, inasmuch as it is a bar bent in the form of a
                                circle; and the barrel of a gun surrounded with a series of hoops
                                might, in that sense, be said to be constructed on a coiled system.
                                But such a system is essentially different from that of the coiled
                                system of Sir W. Armstrong.</p>
                            <p>Captain Blakely claims to have invented and patented a gun identical
                                in mode of construction with Sir W. Armstrong’s, and he has,
                                moreover, expressed his concurrence with Mr. Whitworth that the
                                coiled system of which he has availed himself “was a well-known
                                method of making guns.” (Second report, p. 223.) The captain
                                maintained, before the committee, that “there was no doubt about the
                                identity.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> p. 223.) He, indeed,
                                commenced an action against the Elswick ordnance committee “for
                                infringement of patent,” and at the same time addressed a letter to
                                the secretary of state for war, notifying the existence of his
                                patent, and suggesting either that the government should purchase
                                the patent right or issue a “command to Sir William Armstrong not to
                                defend an action in which his cause is so manifestly unjust.” (<hi
                                    rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> p. 599.) In a letter, dated January
                                22, 1861, addressed to the under-secretary of state for war, (the
                                late Sir Benjamin Hawes,) the captain demanded the moderate sum of
                                    <hi rend="italic">£</hi>500,000 for the assignment of his
                                patent. (<hi rend="italic">lbid.,</hi> p. 550.) The charge of
                                infringement was denied, under the advice of the law officers of the
                                crown. The captain desisted from further legal proceedings, having
                                been informed by Mr. Montague Smith, Q. C, “that an action would not
                                hold against her Majesty’s ministers; that the guns were being made
                                for the Queen, and a subject would have no remedy.” (<hi
                                    rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> p. 226.) It is to be regretted that
                                other patentees, who have caused so much annoyance to the
                                government, should not have had the benefit of similar advice.</p>
                            <p>The projectile peculiar to the Armstrong gun, and designated the
                                segment shell, is confessedly one of the most ingenious and
                                important elements of the Armstrong system of artillery. It consists
                                essentially of a large number of segmental pieces of cast-iron,
                                arranged like bricks m a well, and solidly compacted together by
                                means of lead, a central cavity: being left to receive the bursting
                                charge of powder. The charge is ignited by means of fuzes, which are
                                made to explode on striking an object, or, if desired, before
                                impact. There <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0294"/>are thus two
                                kinds of fuzes, termed the percussion fuze and the time fuze, and
                                particular varieties of each. It is not possible to render their
                                construction intelligible by mere verbal description, and we shall,
                                therefore, refrain from an attempt to do so. The observations which
                                Sir W. Armstrong made to the committee respecting his projectiles
                                and fuzes deserve careful perusal. But they are too lengthy for
                                quotation <hi rend="italic">in extenso,</hi> and we therefore insert
                                the following extract, which seems to embody the most important:</p>
                            <p>“I will take this opportunity of explaining to the committee the
                                principle of construction of this segment shell. The spaces between
                                the segments are entirely closed with lead, which renders the whole
                                interior perfectly compact and solid, so that the interior segments
                                contribute to strengthen the shell, and are like the structure of an
                                arch. In consequence of that I am enabled to have the external case
                                extremely thin, and by that means to get a much larger capacity for
                                those pieces and for the bursting charge than if I were forced to
                                use a thick shell. Now I can only use this very thin shell by such a
                                mode of rifling as mine, and for this reason, that whenever the gun
                                is fired, this soft-coated shell is forced into the tightly fitting
                                bore, and the compression of the bore holds it tight and prevents
                                its breaking; without that lateral support I should want a much
                                greater thickness in the external case. I only mention this to show
                                how the projectile may be related to the mode of rifling, so that
                                you cannot alter one part of the system without affecting the other
                                parts. Thus it is with regard to those fuzes. I have found, in my
                                attempts to apply the shunt system of rifling to shells, that even
                                that variation in the mode of rifling (although it embraces the
                                principle of soft metal and compression) necessitated my making
                                certain alterations in the fuzes. These (producing specimens) are
                                fuzes for shunt guns, which are slightly different from the others,
                                the alterations being such as are necessitated by the mode of
                                rifling. You cannot ascertain the best mode of rifling unless you
                                take into calculation what sort of projectile and what kind of fuze
                                is compatible with that mode of rifling.” (Second report, p.
                                146.)</p>
                            <p>The advantages claimed for the Armstrong field-gun are lightness
                                combined with strength and durability, great precision and extent of
                                range, and for the projectile uniformity and remarkable
                                destructiveness. The disadvantages, on the other hand, ascribed to
                                the gun are founded on the nature of the gun, and the nature of the
                                ammunition. Under the first head are stated breech-loading,
                                deficient strength, and the liability to breakage of the
                                vent-pieces, loss of ricochet, multiplicity of parts, and that, on
                                the whole, the gun is too delicately constructed for the rough
                                usages of war. Under the second head, or that of ammunition, are
                                stated stripping off of the lead coating during flight, liability of
                                the projectiles to become unserviceable in store in consequence of
                                corrosion due to chemical action, excited by contact of lead with
                                iron, and untrustworthiness of the fuzes. The advantages and
                                disadvantages we shall now consider <hi rend="italic"
                                >seriatim.</hi></p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Lightness.</hi>—We all remember the memorable
                                effect at Inkermann of the two 18-pounder cast-iron guns, weighing
                                forty-two hundred weight each. It was this incident which directed
                                Sir W. Armstrong’s attention to the construction of a field-gun
                                capable of performing the work of heavy guns of this kind, and yet
                                so light as to admit of being moved with facility. On this point,
                                relating to the history of his gun, Sir W. Armstrong communicated
                                the following information in his report to the war office, July 14,
                                1855:</p>
                            <p>“I may be permitted to observe that the incident which chiefly
                                contributed to direct my attention to this subject still appears to
                                furnish a forcible illustration of its importance. I allude to the
                                memorable service rendered at Inkermann by means of two 18-pounders,
                                laboriously dragged from the batteries, and ultimately directed with
                                great gallantry and success against the Russian artillery, at a
                                distance from which the numerous but lighter guns of the enemy could
                                not effectually reply. Now, these two battery guns were but a clumsy
                                substitute <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0295"/>for light
                                long-range field-guns, which would have rendered the same important
                                service with more promptitude and ease, and could have operated at a
                                greater distance from the enemy’s fire.”</p>
                            <p>Our field batteries in the Crimea were armed with 9-pounder and our
                                horse artillery with 6-pounder brass guns, the former weighing
                                thirteen and a half hundred weight, and the latter six hundred
                                weight each. The 6-pounder guns were, however, exchanged for
                                9-pounders. The 9-pounder gun is now replaced by the Armstrong
                                12-pounder of eight and a half hundred weight, and the 6-pounder by
                                the Armstrong 9-pounder of six hundred weight. By this alteration
                                the service has, therefore, obtained the advantage of possessing
                                guns which not only project heavier missiles with greater precision
                                and to a greater distance, but are also considerably lighter than
                                those previously in use.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Strength.</hi>—On this point was adduced before the
                                committee a war office memorandum, dated March 6, 1862, from which
                                we insert the following extract:</p>
                            <p>“An endeavor has also been made to test a gun of this [12-pounder]
                                nature to destruction; one hundred rounds were fired in quick
                                succession with service charges, and thirty rounds with double
                                charges and cylinders (in lieu of projectiles) progressing in weight
                                up to a hundred and twenty pounds, and the result of this trial was
                                considered as proving that it was practically impossible to burst a
                                gun in ordinary service.” (First report, p. 218.)</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Durability.</hi>—Sir W. Armstrong gave the
                                following evidence before the committee in proof of the durability
                                of the 12-pounder gun:</p>
                            <p>“I have also a statement of the number of rounds fired from certain
                                unlined guns of an early state of manufacture. I find here No. 7 has
                                been fired 3,263 rounds, and is perfectly good and serviceable. I
                                have here another 12-pounder, No. 6, which has been fired 1,953
                                rounds, another which has been fired 1,515 rounds, another which has
                                been fired 1,911 rounds, and another which has been fired 1,146
                                rounds, giving an average of nearly 2,000 rounds, without injury to
                                the gun.” (Second report, p. 149.)</p>
                            <p>“The number of 12-pounders issued for the land service is 392, and
                                for the sea service 178; to them I have to add the sixty-six
                                9-pounders, which make altogether 636. Out of those six hundred and
                                thirty-six 12-pounders issued, and in use, only thirteen have been
                                returned to Woolwich for repair, and out of those thirteen two were
                                repaired at a cost of 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic"
                                    >d</hi>.; of the remaining eleven we had seven guns that were
                                returned as defective in consequence of being lined, so that if we
                                had not unfortunately adopted this mistake of lining defective guns
                                we should only have had, out of six hundred and thirty-six guns,
                                four guns returned to Woolwich for repair. * * * Now, the number of
                                rounds fired from those guns cannot, I believe, be much short of
                                fifty thousand rounds; in fact it would be more. At Shoeburyness
                                alone we had twenty-two thousand, [the actual number was twenty-two
                                thousand seven hundred sixty-five—see second report, p. 159,] while
                                we had in China about four thousand, making twenty-six thousand. We
                                had, again, in the experimental [rapid] firing with entire batteries
                                upwards of four thousand rounds; that brings up the number to thirty
                                thousand; and then we had all the ammunition issued for experimental
                                practice with the batteries, which is fifty rounds per gun per year,
                                some of those guns having been upwards of two years in the service,
                                so that fifty rounds each upon the six hundred and thirty-six guns
                                would be thirty thousand rounds. The result is, in all, sixty
                                thousand; but I will call it fifty thousand. So that those
                                casualties to which I have been referring occurred in the history of
                                fifty thousand rounds fired from six hundred and thirty-six guns.”

                            <p><hi rend="italic">Uniformity of projectiles.</hi>—This is regarded as
                                one of the most important improvements effected by Sir W. Armstrong
                                in field artillery. In his evidence before the committee Sir William
                                stated:</p>
                            <p>“I found that at that time the service projectiles for field
                                artillery consisted of three different forms: first, the solid shot;
                                secondly, the shrapnell shell; third, common case or canister. Now,
                                the disadvantages of having three different projectiles was
                                this—that batteries were liable to expend for any particular service
                                the form of ammunition which was particularly adapted for that
                                service, and were consequently compelled to resort quickly to a form
                                of ammunition which was not adapted for that service. The idea,
                                therefore, occurred to me of adopting a form of projectile which
                                should be convertible, so as to be used either as solid shot,
                                shrapnell shell, or canister, and this was the origin of the segment
                                shell, in which the arrangement of the segment is made to contribute
                                to the strength of the shell. In so doing I Was enabled to use a
                                shell of a very small thickness, so as to obtain an amount of room
                                which I could not otherwise have obtained for the stowage of the
                                contents of the shell. In this way I produced a shell which for all
                                practical purposes had the solidity of a solid shot, and when used
                                without a burster or a fuze produced the effect of a solid shot.
                                When used with a percussion fuze it produced a percussion shell
                                bursting upon impact; when used with a time fuze it represented the
                                ordinary shrapnell shell; and when used with a special adjustment of
                                either the time or the percussion fuze it <pb n="277"
                                    xml:id="pg_277" facs="0297"/>could be caused to burst at the
                                muzzle of the gun, in which case it answered the purpose of common
                                case or canister.” (Second report, p. 135.)</p>
                            <p>Major Milward, R. A., who commanded a battery of Armstrong guns in
                                China, has given in his report to General Crofton the following
                                testimony to the correctness of the foregoing remarks of Sir W.
                                Armstrong:</p>
                            <p>“An enormous advantage of the gun is the great facility of replacing
                                the ammunition; the old difficulty of being out of one description
                                of ammunition while there may be plenty of another is entirely
                                obviated; a few seconds refills a limber-box, and the wagons can
                                retire out of fibre, only one at a time being required up with the
                                battery.” (First report, app., p. 213.)</p>
                            <p>“On the subject of ammunition Major Milward has stated that ‘they
                                were only supplied with one kind of projectile, but that they found
                                a great benefit in having only one kind of ammunition in the
                                battery, because they found that in replenishing the ammunition in
                                the field they had simply to bring up any limber or any wagon and
                                empty it into the one they were using, and whenever they put their
                                hands into the limber-box whatever they wanted was at hand.’”
                                (Second report, p. 144.)</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Destructiveness of the projectiles.</hi>—Of all the
                                instruments of warfare yet invented the Armstrong segment shell is
                                admitted to be the most destructive, even by the stoutest opponents
                                of the Armstrong system, and the credit of originality in this
                                respect was not questioned before the committee. The shell of a
                                12-pounder is composed of forty-nine segments of cast-iron, which on
                                explosion are scattered far and wide, and its terriffic effect,
                                therefore, may well be conceived. In the late Chinese war the value
                                of this shell was strikingly demonstrated, as will be seen from the
                                following evidence presented by Sir W. Armstrong to the
                                committee:</p>
                            <p>“In the first place I would observe that destructiveness is the
                                cardinal virtue of a gun, and the first thing that we have to
                                inquire into, in judging of a gun, is its power of destruction. I
                                will first speak of the destructive effect of the gun when used in
                                the open field as a field-gun. In an action near Pekin a body of
                                about five hundred Tartar cavalry halted at a distance of about
                                fifteen hundred yards from some of our guns, where they imagined
                                themselves to be safe. Sir Hope Grant proposed to try the effect of
                                one shot at them, and he accordingly ordered one gun to be fired.
                                The projectile, which was the ordinary segment shell, containing the
                                usual concussion fuze, touched the ground a few yards in front of
                                the Tartars, and burst in the usual manner. The Tartars immediately
                                fled, and left on the ground thirteen dead men and three disabled
                                horses, all destroyed by that one shell, which was the only one
                                fired. I state this on the authority of Captain Richard Harrison, of
                                the royal engineers, who was standing close by when the shot was
                                fired. I further state, on the authority of Major Milward, who
                                commanded a battery of those guns in China, that he used the guns
                                with very great effect in the open field at ranges varying from four
                                hundred and fifty yards to two thousand yards. He states that the
                                damaging effect of the shells was very great, that the Tartar horses
                                are very thick horses, and that at one thousand two hundred yards he
                                found that the segments had gone completely through them, and left a
                                mark on the off-side of the horse just as if cut out with a knife,
                                as clean as on the near side. The shells and concussion fuzes, he
                                asserts, acted admirably; nothing could be better than the bursting
                                of the shells. He found great benefit in the concussion fuzes from
                                the circumstance that he could pick up the range with great
                                facility, because the place where the shell burst was distinctly
                                seen. Next, as to the effect of the guns against Tartar gunners
                                protected by earthworks, Captain Harrison has stated that at a large
                                fortified village called Tangku there were sixteen or eighteen
                                gunners of the Tartars killed at one gum. He says that the shells
                                were very destructive against the men behind the parapet. He saw
                                where the shells struck the parapet, and the men behind were all
                                killed by the Armstrong <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0298"
                                />shell. He says the Armstrong guns were considered terribly
                                effective, and that at the taking of the Taku forts they saved a
                                great deal of loss on our side, and that there were an immense
                                number killed by the Armstrong guns. Captain Harrison, who says
                                this, states that he saw every shot fired by the Armstrong guns
                                against forts in China. I further state, on the authority of Major
                                Milward, that his battery fired into the Taku forts at the distance
                                of two thousand yards, and that it was afterwards ascertained that
                                the shell had produced very great effect. All these effects were
                                produced by ammunition of the oldest patterns, which, as may easily
                                be supposed, were very far from perfect. The bursting charges of the
                                shells proved insufficient to break them thoroughly up; and both
                                fuzes and bursters had suffered great deterioration by exposure to
                                damp, The time fuzes, in fact, had been completely spoiled. There
                                cannot, therefore, be a doubt that the effects obtained in that war
                                would fall greatly short of what would now be realized by the
                                ammunition in its improved form. No such effects as those have ever
                                been claimed for the French artillery, and, in fact, it is quite
                                impossible to suppose that ammunition such as they used, even if
                                their guns had been equally powerful, was capable of producing
                                comparable effects.”</p>
                            <p>Dr. Muir, C. B., inspector general, principal medical officer of the
                                expeditionary army in China, states that—</p>
                            <p>“The severity of the wounds made by Armstrong shell was remarked upon
                                by every medical officer. They were positively frightful. The
                                effects of this destructive weapon had evidently produced a panic,
                                as several dead Chinese soldiers were found tied to their guns by
                                their plaited tails of hair, as a punishment, doubtless, for
                                attempting to escape.” (Army Medical Department Report, 1860, p.
                                382.)</p>
                            <p>The committee sum up the evidence which they procured on this subject
                                in the following decisive language:</p>
                            <p>“The testimony as to the Armstrong shell has been universally
                                favorable; it is described as the most destructive weapon ever used
                                against wooden ships, and most formidable in its effects and range.

                            <p>In our next article we shall proceed to examine the objections urged
                                before the committee against the Armstrong field artillery.</p>

                            copy of Consul Phelps’s letter. In obedience to your instructions I have
                            called the attention of the minister of foreign affairs to the subject,
                            and asked his good offices in suppressing all such enterprises, if there
                            are any. * * * The assisting, directly or indirectly, the English to fit
                            out war vessels to be employed by the “Confederate States” against the
                            United States, would be a violation of neutrality, for the very act
                            carries proof of the unfriendly intention, and would make all aiders and
                            abettors guilty of an illegal act, no matter when or by whom it might be
                            consummated. But Mr. Phelps don’t pretend to give any proof of such
                            acts, or even the names of such persons; and of course the imperial
                            government can have no base of action. In truth, I don’t believe that
                            any such attempts as fitting out war vessels are being made here; and if
                            they are, England, where the vessels are <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279"

                            course no one would voluntarily avow such criminal designs, if they were

                            <p>The undersigned, minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary of
                                the United States of America, has the honor to enclose to his
                                excellency Prince Gortcshacow, vice-chancellor and minister of
                                foreign affairs, &amp;c., &amp;c., a copy of a letter from the
                                United States consul at St. Petersburg, E. D. Phelps, esq., to the
                                Secretary of State at Washington, to which he is instructed to call
                                the attention of the Russian government.</p>
                            <p>The allegations are too indefinite in character and proof to provoke
                                any discussion; and the American minister, relying upon the
                                friendship of his imperial Majesty, prefers to put himself upon the
                                good offices of his excellency rather than upon the neutrality which
                                the laws of nations might seem to demand, to prevent the Russian
                                subjects from trespassing upon the rights of the American Union, by
                                these sales or purchases.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned believes that he has only to advise his excellency of
                                these unfriendly enterprises, which are rumored to be on foot, in
                                order to cause their prompt suppression if true.</p>
                            <p>The American minister avails himself of this occasion to renew to his
                                excellency Prince Gortchacow assurances of his most distinguished
                                regard.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of November 8, No. 29, has
                            been received. It is gratifying to know that the Russian naval
                            authorities apprehend so well the friendly and fraternal reception which
                            attended the Russian fleet on its visit to the United States.</p>
                        <p>The welcome extended to them in our principal ports was an unprompted act
                            of the American people. It was, I believe, as universal as it was
                            spontaneous. Admiral Lessoffsky, with a portion of the fleet, has at
                            length entered the Chesapeake and ascended the Potomac. I had the honor
                            on the 5th instant to receive the admiral and his associates, and after
                            bidding them a cordial welcome in behalf of the President, I presented
                            them to my associates in the administration. Yesterday the admiral
                            received the heads of departments on board the flag-ship, and in the
                            evening the Russian visitors met the heads of departments and a large
                            party of United States naval officers at dinner at my house. The
                            President has earnestly desired that their reception at this capital
                            might reflect <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0300"/>the cordially and
                            friendship which the nation cherishes towards Russia, and thus far, I am
                            happy to say, this wish has been realized. Indisposition of the
                            President has, until now, prevented him from giving them a formal
                            audience.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The brilliant and signal defeat of the
                            insurgents which occurred on the 24th and 25th days of November, in
                            front of Chattanooga, was followed by the rapid movement of re-enforcing
                            columns from the army at that point to the support of General Burnside
                            at Knoxville. The siege of that town was immediately raised, and thus
                            the great Alleghany ridge, next in military importance only to the great
                            river channel of the west, is effectually reclaimed by the national
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Congress assembled on the 7th instant, and the session was inaugurated on
                            the 9th by the delivery of the President’s annual message. It was well
                            received by the national legislature, and it seems to be no less
                            satisfactory to the loyal people of the United States. You have especial
                            ability to judge how far the exposition of our foreign relations is
                            truthful and accurate. It is hoped that the firmness and liberality
                            which the President manifests will exert a good influence upon public
                            opinion in other countries.</p>
                        <p>The confidence of our fellow-citizens in the stability of the Union,
                            which has been rapidly reviving since the great victories of July, has
                            been entirely restored by the expositions of our moral, material, and
                            physical resources which are furnished by the heads of the several
                            departments.</p>
                        <p>Through what seems a fortunate coincidence, the insurgent chief at
                            Richmond has put forth an explanation of the present state of the
                            rebellion simultaneously with the publication of the message of the
                            President of the United States. It would be difficult, I think, to
                            decide which of the two documents, namely, that message or the appeal of
                            the insurgent leader to his misguided faction, most clearly illustrates
                            the absurdity of the attempt to build up an independent state on the
                            foundation of human bondage within the existing boundaries of this
                            firmly established and compactly organized free American republic.
                            European statesmen will doubtlessly collate them. I shall be surprised
                            if that process does not result in producing a moral conviction that the
                            American people are, and must continue henceforth to be, one indivisible
                            nation.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I begin my correspondence of the new year
                            with a grateful acknowledgment of my approval of the President’s late
                            message to Congress, and the accompanying proclamation. At the
                            suggestion of Mr. Bergh, secretary of legation, I enclose you a clipping
                            from the London Star, which I make a part of this despatch. This journal
                            has been before and since the rebellion the constant, truthful, and
                            courageous advocate of our country and its cause. I know not whether the
                            government has in any way recognized the disinterested labors of this
                            popular newspaper; but, in acceding to the request of Mr. Bergh, who
                            chanced to be in London during the first year of the rebellion, when
                            such malignity and falsehood were uttered against our government and
                            people by the English press, I realize a double pleasure in doing
                            justice to an able friend of our country, and in availing myself of an
                            opportunity to strengthen the President in his patriotic course, by
                            bringing to his notice one of the many pæans which more and more his
                            enlightened and generous course towards an inoffensive and oppressed

                        <p>We heard of the President’s illness with sorrow, and now rejoice in the
                            news of his recovery. I do not agree with Mr. Lincoln in all things, but
                            I am not prepared to say that he has not done the best possible under
                            the circumstances for the salvation of the country. It was only when we
                            thought that we might lose him, that we felt how to appreciate his
                            industry, his honesty, his balanced judgment, and above all his fidelity
                            to human rights.</p>

                            <p>The reception of President Lincoln’s message by Congress and the
                                northern press is highly auspicious of its ultimate effect. The
                                electoral successes of the opposition in the fall of last year made
                                it doubtful whether the government would have a strong majority in
                                the new Congress. But the choice of Mr. Colfax as speaker and of the
                                Rev. W. H. Channing as chaplain, in preference to the pro-slavery
                                Bishop Hopkins, were hopeful indications to the contrary. These have
                                been confirmed by a vote of 98 to 59, refusing to entertain a
                                resolution by the notorious Fernando Wood in favor of sending peace
                                commissioners to Richmond. The offers of amnesty by the President,
                                resting upon his constitutional authority, do not require to be
                                approved by Congress; but those portions of the message and
                                proclamation which refer to the re-establishment of State
                                governments have been referred to a select committee, with
                                instructions to prepare bills for giving them effect. In the
                                minority of eighty upon this resolution there were no doubt a number
                                of republicans favorable to what is considered the more radical
                                policy of provincializing the subjugated States. It is feared by
                                these earnest loyalists and abolitionists that the premature
                                restoration of political rights to the vanquished rebels may
                                endanger the best fruits of republican victory—that the southern and
                                democratic vote may be again allied in the interests of slavery. The
                                apprehension derives some support from the terms of the
                                proclamation. The oath of obedience to the acts of government and
                                Congress in relation to slaves is to be taken, subject to any
                                modification of those acts by legislative or judicial decisions. It
                                is not pretended that the oath could be administered free from this
                                liability, but it is feared that advantage may be taken of the
                                President’s clemency not only to prevent his own re-election, but
                                    <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0302"/>to subvert his noblest
                                achievements. This feeling finds some expression in the abolitionist
                                journals, but they are almost unanimous in substantial approval of
                                the scheme of which the oath is a part. It is the copperhead press
                                alone that denounces the project—a fact from which we may safely
                                conclude that it is a project which cannot be perverted to the
                                revival of slavery or of the political predominance of slaveholders
                                and their allies. The fury of their organs against the Presidential
                                plan should be its passport to the acceptance of all good men— if,
                                indeed, its authorship is not commendation enough to the
                                sympathizing judgment of all who love freedom and who desire a just
                                and lasting peace.</p>
                            <p>The sincerity of Mr. Lincoln’s anti-slavery professions is as
                                unquestionable as the practical wisdom of the measures by which he
                                gives them effect. The history of the world affords no superior
                                example of an honest and enlightened ruler. He is a man whose words
                                are deeds, and whose deeds are as well considered as his words are
                                just. He answers to the Old Testament expression of true
                                statesmanship and patriotism, “wise, as understanding the time.” If
                                he has not the genius to anticipate the necessities of his
                                generation, he has the faculty which is even rarer—that of applying
                                to them the remedies which are both possible and effectual. He took
                                his stand upon the anti-slavery platform when to do so was to incur
                                the penalty of probable exclusion from those high places which his
                                country’s constitution opens to the ambition of the poorest. Without
                                aid from wealth, from family, or even the eloquence by which
                                multitudes are swayed, he attained a great and unexpected but most
                                perilous success. Never was the temptation to political apostasy
                                stronger than when Abraham Lincoln was offered the undisputed
                                enjoyment of his sudden elevation on condition of compromise with
                                the principles on which he had been elected. His honesty may have
                                cost his country a civil war; but even that price, with all its
                                personal perils and cares, he preferred to pay. With full
                                deliberation he advanced along the path on which he entered, and
                                with unshaken constancy he has maintained his every footstep.
                                Despite treason among his own officers as well as rebellion in half
                                the States, despite disaffection and division in the north,
                                threatening at one time to seat the confederate president at
                                Washington, despite the unfriendliness of foreign powers and the
                                absence of manifested sympathy even from the most friendly nations,
                                he formed and executed the sublime resolution to destroy slavery
                                with its own weapons, to regenerate as well as re-establish the
                                Union. In this resolve he has persevered, making his way, like our
                                own Cromwell, in Miltonic phrase, through “a cloud of detractions
                                rude,” not less formidable than the hosts of war. And now, reviewing
                                the year of emancipation—reciting to the Congress and people of the
                                loyal States the progress that has been made in the liberation of
                                the enslaved and the conversion of the rebels’ bondsmen into
                                citizens and soldiers of the republic—he spurns as “a cruel and
                                astounding breach of faith” the return of a single negro to his
                                former owner, loyal or rebellious; and aspires to the glory of
                                making the United States the world’s great “home of freedom,
                                disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged, and perpetuated.”</p>
                            <p>It is no derogation from the merits of the President to add that the
                                cause of emancipation is now safe beyond the power of betrayal by
                                any man or men. It has celebrated, in its thirtieth decade, the
                                virtual consummation of an enterprise than which the world has seen
                                none more noble in conception, more courageously prosecuted, more
                                happily successful. Thirty years ago it was begun by a band of
                                God-trusting men and women not exceeding in number the first
                                evangelists of the Christian faith. The seventy have converted a
                                nation. They have emerged from the pelting storm of social and
                                political persecution— a storm that often threatened life, and
                                sometimes took it—into the clear shining of popular favor and
                                governmental help. They have now the President of the Union for
                                their chief, Congress for their committee-room, armies and fleets
                                for their executive. Ten or eleven of the forty surviving members of
                                its first organization—the American anti-slavery society—were
                                present the other day at a <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0303"
                                />great commemorative meeting in Philadelphia. The principal hall of
                                that city was thronged for two days by the representatives of this
                                great revolution. With Garrison in the chair and a picture of John
                                Brown over the platform, they had senators among the orators and the
                                non-commissioned officers of a colored regiment among the delegates.
                                The greatest general in the Union service —the thrice victorious
                                Grant, the conqueror of Mississippi and of Tennessee—was reported by
                                one of the speakers, Senator Wilson, as an accession to the cause.
                                The general does not profess to be an abolitionist on abstract
                                principle, declines to say anything of politics or political
                                parties, but affirms his conviction that slavery is dead past
                                raising; and that if it were not, the north and south could never
                                live together again as a nation. Well might the fathers of the
                                abolition movement give thanks to God for his marvellous and
                                crowning mercies when they heard this testimony! They enlisted for a
                                war to which they saw no end in their lifetime. They feared that the
                                Union must perish ere slavery would die. Heaven has been better to
                                them than their hopes or fears. They rejoice to see the Union
                                re-establishing itself upon the grave of the institution that was
                                its reproach, its peril, and its curse.</p>

                            d’Invalide Russie a note saying that by the order of the minister of war
                            he sent me several numbers of that journal, comparing the Polish and
                            confederate insurrections, and expressing the sympathy which Russia
                            feels for America.</p>

                            opportunity, to be placed in the archives of the State Department. The
                            good feeling of the people of Russia, and the Russian government, is
                            displayed in many ways, and is greatly heightened by the cordial
                            reception given by our countrymen to the Russian officers. Her Imperial
                            Majesty and the Grand Duke Heritier expressed themselves to be gratified
                            at the hospitality shown the Russian officers, and at the ball given on
                            the 24th instant, at the palace, the Emperor used very marked terms of
                            satisfaction at the more intimate relations growing up between the two

                            receipt of your despatch of the 5th of January last, and to thank you,
                            in the President’s name, for the generous sentiments which you have
                            expressed in regard to his policy and his health.</p>
                        <p>The experiment of reconstruction is begun in Louisiana, Arkansas, and
                            Tennessee under what seem to be favorable auspices. The legislature of
                            Maryland has provided for taking the sense of the people of that State
                            upon the question of emancipation.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            archives which the direction of the Invalide Russia has made.</p>
                        <p>The President is highly gratified with the good feeling expressed by the
                            Emperor.</p>
                        <p>If we are not disappointed the campaign now opening will so far restore
                            the prestige of the government of the Union as to warrant us in hoping
                            that Russia will not be so much isolated as she has hitherto been in a
                            just and friendly policy towards the United States.</p>

                            circular 543. For the summary of the military situation accept my
                            sincere thanks, for the conflicting statements in the newspapers leave
                            us always in a state of uncertainty and <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287"
                                facs="0307"/>anxiety. We have news of General Grant’s battles up to
                            the 12th instant, and intelligence from New York still later. It seems,
                            at last, that we have a general who follows up a victory and understands
                            the importance of concentration. Whatever may be the result of the
                            difficult campaign towards Richmond, all Europe feels that Grant has
                            added new laurels to his already well-earned fame; and that, if he
                            fails, it will be only because success is impossible; however that may
                            be, final triumph of our arms must come sooner or later. “The Union, it
                            must be preserved!”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The emancipation of the Russian serfs has
                            so far proved a success. Turbulence on the part of the liberated, and
                            revolutionary attempts on the side of their late masters, are no longer
                            thought of. Society moves steadily on in its new career. The Emperor has
                            ordered the soldiers of all the regiments to be instructed by regimental
                            officers, and old and young have made great progress. The village
                            priests are also allowed pay for teaching the peasants, and independent
                            schools are rapidly increasing. The aristocracy who exhausted the empire
                            by “absenteeism” now return to their estates. Russia reaps the double
                            advantage of interested labor and more intelligent direction. Rapid
                            advances are made in the introduction of new processes and machinery in
                            farming; ship-building and general manufactures are increased,
                            monopolies abolished, telegraphs and railroads extended; the American
                            system of street railroad is introduced into St. Petersburg, even into
                            the most fashionable streets; the bonds of caste are being broken down,
                            and the rank of the nobles and the wealth of the laboring class begin to
                            mingle in marriage; the liberal policy of the Emperor, I know by
                            personal observation, has infused new life into Finland; the same policy
                            begins to bear fruit in Poland; the whole empire has entered on a new
                            career of more liberal institutions and fixed forms. I doubt not that
                            the imperial policy now looks to an ultimate constitutional empire. * *
                            Russia shares with them her franchises, amalgamates with them, and
                            civilizes <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0308"/>them. The world
                            should not regard her progress into Asia with distrust, but
                            gratification. The new life must come from the west, and Russia is the
                            only nation which can give it. No people are making more advances
                            comparatively than the Russians in the fine and useful arts, in science
                            and letters, and in general intelligence. A great destiny lies before
                            her; let us be careful for our own sakes, and the cause of humanity, to
                            reciprocate her friendly sentiments towards us. * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The renomination of Mr. Lincoln inspires new confidence in national
                            success. * * * * * * There is a moral fitness in the continuation of
                            Abraham Lincoln in office, till the rebellion is suppressed. It was the
                            revolt of conservative error against progressive right of the few,
                            against the many, of the aristocracy against the people. Jefferson Davis
                            represents the one idea, Abraham Lincoln the other; personally and
                            politically half the fruits of our hard struggle would be lost under any
                            other leader. I rejoice in his nomination, and have confidence in his
                            triumph in the elections and in the war.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: We have a telegram to-day that the
                            President has consented to make peace with the south upon the basis only
                            of a restoration of the Union and the abolition of slavery. I rejoice at
                            this resolve, (rejecting all minor terms;) let us give general amnesty;
                            restore the confiscated lands—do anything but yield the Union and allow
                            slavery, without the destruction of which it would be worth nothing, and
                            all our blood would have been shed in vain.</p>
                        <p>I copy from the St. Petersburg Journal, to-day, a notice of this resolve
                            of the President, concluding: “The struggle then, goes, on; the end
                            cannot be foreseen; it is, however, consoling to observe that, in the
                            interest of humanity and to the honor of the federal government, this
                            last does not intend to abandon the precious fruit of a struggle, so
                            bloody and so long as has actually been the war of the United States,
                            the abolition of slavery upon the free soil of the American
                            republic.”</p>
                        <p>Such is not only the language of the official journal here, but the
                            sentiment of all true friends of the republic, abroad and at home. Let
                            us stand thereto, live or die! I beg you to lay this before the
                            President.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>. * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The Emperor and Russians have not been wanting in reciprocating the
                            courtesies shown the naval officers and fleet in America. I was lately
                            invited to <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0309"/>spend a few days at
                            the imperial palace of Kopcha, about 40 versts from here, to be present
                            at a mock campaign and fight of about 60,000 troops. * * * His Majesty
                            told me that he had allowed his officers lately in the United States to
                            call upon me in mass, and express their gratitude for the courtesies
                            extended to them in America; all of which was evidently intended as a
                            national compliment. The Prince Galitzin, aide-de-camp or chief of the
                            suite of the minister of the marine, General Krabbe, called first upon
                            me, and returned thanks on behalf of the minister, and asked when it
                            would be agreeable to me for Admiral Lessoffsky and his officers to call
                            in mass and pay their respects. I named Thursday last. On that day the
                            admiral and officers, accompanied by Count Admiral Greig, chief of the
                            staff of the grand admiral, his Imperial Highness the Grand Duke
                            Constantine, and also of the suite of the Emperor, called upon me as
                            agreed. They were received by myself and Secretary Bergh in full
                            uniform.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Greig said he was commanded by his Imperial Majesty to return
                            thanks for the courtesies shown his navy in the United States, and
                            instructed also to introduce to me Admiral Lessoffsky and his officers,
                            whom he had also permitted to call on me in person to give expression to
                            their friendly sentiments. The admiral was then introduced, made a
                            complimentary address, and then introduced his suite. I responded in
                            like expressions of regard; then introduced Mr. Bergh, who made a few
                            remarks in French, which were, perhaps, generally better understood than
                            my English. After a pleasant interview, we separated. I asked leave,
                            however, to return the visit at such time as would be convenient, and
                            Saturday last was named.</p>
                        <p>On Saturday one of the officers of the fleet called, and put us upon the
                            imperial yacht, which was in the city. We were there received by Admiral
                            Greig, who escorted us to the fleet beyond Cronstadt. The American flag
                            was flying at the masthead. When we hove in sight we were signalled in
                            our approach by cannon, and again saluted as we neared the flag-ship;
                            the starry banner of the republic flying also at the admiral’s ship’s
                            masthead. After being shown the ship, we sat down to an elegant
                            collation, at which the health of the President was first drunk; then
                            other toasts and speeches were made, the band alternating between Yankee
                            Doodle, the Russian national anthem, and other fine music. The admiral
                            of Cronstadt was also present to honor us. After a most pleasant day, we
                            took leave, entered again upon the imperial yacht, and, amidst the
                            firing of cannon and the waving of hats along the whole fleet, we set
                            out for St. Petersburg, where we were safely set ashore. As these honors
                            were for our country, and not for me, I shall prepare a printed report
                            of the same, and send you in a few days.</p>
                        <p>At a supper given by the oldest regiment of the “guards,” at
                            Krasnoe-Selo, where all the officers of the 60,000 troops were present,
                            the Grand Duke Nicolas, and the two Grand Dukes Alexander and Vladimir,
                            and the Prince Oldenburg of the imperial family, our country was warmly
                            toasted, and myself, as its representative, especially honored.</p>
                        <p>It will be our own fault if the friendship between the nations shall
                            prove short or useless.</p>
                        <p>I am, truly, your obedient servant,</p>

                                under command of Rear-Admiral Lessoffsky.</head>
                            <p>On the 11th of August Prince Galizin, aide-de-camp to the minister of
                                marine, and on his behalf, presented himself at the legation of the
                                United States in St. Petersburg, Russia, and announced to General
                                Clay, representative of that country, that it was the desire of
                                Rear-Admiral Lessoffsky, and the officers under his command, to call
                                on him and return thanks for the friendly reception which they had
                                everywhere received in America.</p>
                            <p>His excellency the minister of the United States, in reply, assured
                                Prince Galitzin that he highly appreciated the honor, and begged
                                leave to appoint the following Thursday, the 18th instant, at
                                noon.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, on that day, Rear-Admiral Lessoffsky, accompanied by a
                                numerous suite, and preceded by Rear-Admiral Greig, aide-de-camp and
                                principal secretary to his Imperial Highness the Grand Duke
                                Constantine, entered the legation, and were received by General Clay
                                and Mr. Bergh, secretary.</p>
                            <p>Rear-Admiral Greig then formally communicated in English the object
                                of the visit, prefacing the presentation of Admiral Lessoffsky and
                                his officers by a speech in the following words:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General</hi>: By command of his Majesty the
                                Emperor, my august master, I have the honor to introduce to your
                                excellency Admiral Lessoffsky, and the officers of the squadron,
                                late in America, under his command.</p>
                            <p>You are aware, doubtless, that his Imperial Majesty has already,
                                through his minister at Washington, expressed to the President his
                                warmest thanks for the cordial and brilliant reception which was
                                extended to the Russian flag by the government and people of the
                                United States. Now, it is the desire of his Imperial Majesty that
                                one of the first acts of the admiral and his officers, on their
                                return to St. Petersburg, should be to present themselves before the
                                American minister for the purpose of giving utterance to the
                                grateful feelings which animate them individually, as well as the
                                entire navy, and all classes of society throughout the empire, for
                                the hearty welcome and magnificent hospitality which they have been
                                the recipients of during their sojourn in the waters of the great
                                republic so ably represented here by you.</p>
                            <p>Admiral Greig then formally presented each officer present, after
                                which Admiral Lessoffsky spoke as follows:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: It is by command of our
                                august sovereign, as well as the promptings of our own feelings,
                                that we appear here to-day to return our grateful acknowledgments to
                                the minister of the United States for distinguished hospitalities
                                which have been extended to us during our prolonged stay in America.
                                Our beloved master in thus anticipating our wishes gives another
                                evidence of the nobleness of his nature, while manifesting his high
                                appreciation of such gratifying assurances of the genuine friendship
                                of a great and gallant people. For ourselves, sir, we realize how
                                impotent is language to faithfully represent the emotions which we
                                experience at the recollection of the boundless and untiring
                                goodness heaped upon us by the men and women of your great nation,
                                beginning with our appearance and scarcely ending by the
                                articulation of the reluctant word “adieu.”</p>
                            <p>General: During our usually stormy voyage of life, it is a pleasant
                                thing, and we congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune, when we
                                receive shelter only from the pitiless storm; but where is the man,
                                and where the forms of speech, that can correctly present his
                                sensations, when the stranger, in addition to this, beholds the
                                unstinted bounty of a nation offered him by the warm hand of
                                friendship?</p>
                            <p>For myself I have ploughed many a sea, and let go my anchor in many
                                hospitable havens, but the country you represent, sir, has left
                                preponderating remembrances, <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0311"
                                />just as the impressions, inspired by a sight of America’s great
                                cataract surpass the emotions occasioned by all similar phenomena of
                                nature. That the day is not distant when your country, now passing
                                through the school of adversity, shall be again happily united, is
                                our earnest prayer, and that of all generous Russians.</p>
                            <p>This speech being finished, the American minister responded in the
                                following language:</p>
                            <p>I am proud to be the medium of transmission to my country of his
                                Imperial Majesty’s good will, and of the thanks of yourselves and
                                the Russian naval officers, late in America. Individual friendships
                                spring from natural laws; they are always agreeable, often useful; a
                                wise man ever seeks to make friends, from policy if not from
                                sentiment; such considerations are applicable both to nations and to
                                individuals.</p>
                            <p>Russia, the great power of the eastern, and the United States of
                                America, of the western world, having no antagonistic interests,
                                would naturally obey these laws of affinity; for though one
                                government is autocratic and the other republican, no necessary
                                antagonism results from such difference of forms.</p>
                            <p>Although we are not prepared to go as far as Pope:</p>
                            <p>“For forms of government let fools contest;</p>
                            <p>Whate’er is best administered is best;”</p>
                            <p>yet we, of all people, are least inclined to propagandism, because we
                                are eminently practical, and we know that political institutions
                                grow, and are not made.</p>
                            <p>From the time of Catharine II, and the hour of our national birth, we
                                have been friends. It was our interest to be so; but, admiral, allow
                                me to say, that the enthusiasm with which you have been received in
                                America sprang from no such cold calculation; it was based upon a
                                higher principle than interest, sentiments yet nobler than the
                                gratitude which we owed your Emperor for his friendship in our hour
                                of trial and misfortune: it came of a common cause in the
                                advancement of our common humanity. Alexander II has liberated by
                                his will more than twenty millions of serfs; we by the power of arms
                                project the freedom of four millions of slaves. Never before in the
                                history of the world had God given into the hands of one man so much
                                power for good, and most nobly and intelligently and bravely has the
                                Emperor done his work. Peter the Great, on the level of the
                                civilization of his age, mastered the physical forces. Powerful in
                                arms, he added new territories to the old, and with iron will and
                                rare intelligence consolidated the power of all. Seeing that in the
                                workshops were created the embryos of the triumphs of the
                                battle-field, by personal example he sought to make labor honorable.
                                He failed because his people were slaves. With all his power he
                                could not remedy the uncleanliness of his peasants, nor compel them
                                to cut their unseemly beards! The peasants seemed wiser than the
                                prince. They needed their beards for protection against the cold.
                                The way to cleanse them was not to <hi rend="italic">shave,</hi> but
                                to <hi rend="italic">free</hi> them!</p>
                            <p>The Emperor Alexander, having a higher stand-point upon the advancing
                                centuries, knowing that mind is superior to matter, wields the moral
                                as Peter did the physical forces. He made the peasants free. Freedom
                                will bring self-respect, and self-respect cleanliness. Greater than
                                Peter, he has made labor honorable, since it is no longer the badge
                                of slavery; and yet he has his callumniators, and so have we! From
                                the enemies of progress the world over, came hypocritical cries
                                against our “fratricidal war”! Great are our sacrifices in blood and
                                treasure, but greater yet will be the gain of our triumph to the
                                human race. Often men have fought for their own liberty; we straggle
                                not for our own, but for the liberties of others. Every fallen hero
                                is the world’s martyr, who dies that the nations may live
                                forever.</p>
                            <p>I thank God that I live to witness these great events. Proud of the
                                history of my own country, I yet congratulate myself upon my
                                associations with your <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0312"/>own
                                great monarch. In Russian annals he will be enrolled as the Emperor
                                of all the Russias, King of Poland, Duke of Finland, and “a’that,”
                                but the world shall better know him for all time as “Alexander the
                                Great, the liberator, the friend of mankind.”</p>

                            <p>General Clay then presented the secretary of legation, Henry Bergh,
                                esq., remarking, as he did so, that as French was perhaps more
                                generally understood by those present than English, the secretary
                                would offer some remarks in that language.</p>
                            <p rend="center">[Translation.]</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen</hi>: I find it difficult resisting
                                the temptation to add a few remarks to those of General Clay,
                                expressive of my pleasure, also, at seeing you here to-day in the
                                legation of our country, and more especially so since the object you
                                have in view is to testify your gratification with the friendly
                                reception which you have everywhere met with in the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>By this courteous reception of the officers and fleet of his Imperial
                                Majesty, gentlemen, our countrymen have shown themselves worthy of
                                that ancient alliance which has for its basis mutual respect and
                                good will.</p>
                            <p>During your absence from your country the journals of Europe have
                                been greatly exercised in divining the object of your visit, and a
                                majority of them have not hesitated to attribute it to a political
                                character, not over favorable to certain European nations. I will
                                not detain you by citing the various hypotheses which these journals
                                have advanced, in order to explain the singular anomaly of two
                                countries, so dissimilar in the form and polity of their government,
                                at the same time so closely connected through their friendly
                                relations as Russia and America; but to us, gentlemen, this presents
                                no difficulty in the way of our perfect comprehension of it. It is
                                explained by a mutually frank and generous policy, by a friendship
                                which knows no wounding souvenir, and above all, by the observance
                                of a firm resolution not to intermeddle in the domestic affairs of
                                one another. Such are the means by which this “mysterious alliance”
                                has been maintained between your country and ours, and I pray God
                                that it may never be impaired; nor is it difficult to imagine the
                                vast advantages which would likewise result to all the governments
                                of the world by the faithful exercise of a similar policy in their
                                intercourse with one another; then, gentlemen, the enormous
                                expenditures of the present day, in the construction of hostile
                                fleets and the organization of prodigious armies; the fabrication of
                                arms and other munitions of war would cease, to be speedily
                                substituted by a beneficent industry, universal fraternity, and a
                                genuine civilization.</p>
                            <p>From thenceforth burning cities and desolated fields, so common in
                                our time, would no more be seen; no longer would the agonizing cry
                                of these wretched victims to a policy as selfish as it is cruel be
                                heard; in a word, gentlemen, the entire world would be brought to
                                understand that “mysterious alliance” which subsists between Russia
                                and America.</p>
                            <p>The formalities of the interview being terminated, the party
                                circulated through the rooms of the legation, pausing from time to
                                time before the portraits of Washington and his Imperial Majesty,
                                Alexander II, which conspicuously adorn the walls.</p>
                            <p rend="center">VISIT TO THE FLEET AT CRONSTADT.</p>
                            <p>According to appointment, made on the occasion of the foregoing
                                reception,</p>
                            <p>the minister of the United States, accompanied by the secretary of
                                legation, visited Rear-Admiral Lessoffsky, on board his ship,
                                Osliaba, lying at Cronstadt, on the following Saturday.</p>
                            <p>At noon of that day an officer was sent to the legation to announce
                                that the <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0313"/>yacht of the
                                Emperor was in readiness at the English quay, and on arriving on
                                board General Clay and the secretary were received by Rear-Admiral
                                Greig, chief of the staff of his Imperial Highness, the grand duke,
                                general admiral, and immediately thereafter started for the fleet,
                                the flag of the republic flying at the masthead. The numerous
                                government vessels lying at anchor, or at the quays along the entire
                                route, manifested their cognizance of the event by manning the
                                rigging, and as the yacht dropped anchor on its arrival, the
                                flag-ship fired a salute of fifteen guns as the “stars and stripes”
                                were unfolded to the breeze from the masthead. With the rapidity
                                incident to perfect order and high discipline, the “gig” of the
                                admiral was in a few minutes alongside of the yacht, and the party
                                were conducted through a rough sea to the stately and defiant
                                floating fortress of the gallant admiral. Amidst cheers, the roar of
                                cannon, and the national airs of the republic, admirably performed
                                by the band of the flagship, the minister, secretary, and their
                                gentlemanly escort, Rearr Admiral Greig, ascended to the deck, where
                                the commander, surrounded by his officers, awaited their
                                arrival.</p>
                            <p>Now were manifested those graceful personal courtesies which, while
                                they tend to smooth the rude asperities that exist along the highway
                                of life, as unerringly proclaim the high-bred gentleman as lights
                                along a friendly sea-coast indicate its form and bearing.</p>
                            <p>Having been shown throughput this splendidly appointed ship, Admiral
                                Lessoffsky then invited the party to inspect the numerous souvenirs
                                with which he had been presented during his sojourn in the United
                                States, and subsequently the entire company sat down to a beautiful
                                dejeuner, that was appropriately interspersed with speeches and
                                sentiments, among which are given the following as evidences of the
                                friendly and social feeling that pervades the minds of the citizens
                                of both countries.</p>

                                <p>And the staff of the admiral and the officers of the Osliaba.</p>
                                <p>The first toast given was by Admiral Lessoffsky:</p>
                                <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen</hi>: I desire you to unite with
                                    me in doing honor to a name which the possessor has already
                                    rendered immortal by the exercise of high moral courage, in
                                    opposition to erroneous popular prejudice, and the practice of a
                                    sublime humanity in the emancipation of the slave:</p>
                                <p>“His excellency Abraham Lincoln, President of the United
                                    States.”</p>
                                <p>General Clay responded:</p>
                                <p>“I might, perhaps, legitimately confine myself to the simple
                                    proposal of the health of the representative of your nation,
                                    ‘the Emperor of Russia,’ but when I reflect that his deeds
                                    belong not to Russia only, but to the world, you will allow me
                                    to propose the health of ‘Alexander, the liberator.’”</p>
                                <p>The third toast was presented by Mr. Bergh, secretary of
                                    legation:</p>
                                <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0314"/>
                                <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen</hi>: I enjoy the distinguished
                                    honor of being permitted to offer a toast, the mention of which
                                    suggests the futility of comment, and the feebleness of the
                                    rarest eloquence; for while, on the one hand, it fills your
                                    loyal hearts and ours with tender recollections of the holy
                                    mission of woman on earth—her love, charity, gentleness, and
                                    maternal devotion, compared with which the loftiest political
                                    and social positions in the world are but tributary; it, on the
                                    other hand, addresses itself to our manly appreciation of all
                                    that is honorable, chivalric, and glorious in the nature of man.
                                    But let me not further mar the beauty of the sentiment by longer
                                    dwelling on it—gentlemen:</p>
                                <p>“Your Christian Sovereign, her Majesty the Empress of Russia, and
                                    the imperial family.”</p>
                                <p>By an admirably preconcerted arrangement, as each of the three
                                    first toasts was uttered, the battery of the Osliaba mingled its
                                    roar along with the cheers of the convives in the cabin.</p>
                                <p>Admiral Lessoffsky then proposed:</p>
                                <p>“The health of the American minister.”</p>
                                <p>Who in turn offered:</p>
                                <p>“Prosperity to the Russian navy.”</p>
                                <p>To this Admiral Lessoffsky replied in the following speech:</p>
                                <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen</hi>: The sentiment just offered
                                    by my honored guest, ‘the prosperity of the Russian navy,’ calls
                                    for a hearty response in favor of that of the United States,
                                    towards which we all entertain reminiscences of such a grateful
                                    character that death alone can obliterate them. For my part, I
                                    shall ever remember with pride the many tokens of good will with
                                    which I personally have been honored by the most eminent
                                    commanders of that gallant navy; and never shall I forget the
                                    pleasant intercourse I have had with all the brave and devoted
                                    sons of that arm of the national defence, who, by their energy,
                                    determination, and professional skill, have proved themselves
                                    worthy of their illustrious predecessors whom, history informs
                                    us, converted the growing trees of the forest into powerful
                                    ships-of-war in the incredibly brief space of fifty days!</p>
                                <p>“Everywhere, that obstacles present themselves to bar their
                                    steady progress, do we discover the same heroism and inventive
                                    genius in removing them; ships of shapes unheard of before are
                                    seen sailing upon waters hitherto only navigated by the clumsy
                                    and shallow flatboat, threading their way through the woods and
                                    bayous at island No. 10, by an ingenious expedient floated over
                                    the rapids of the Red river, and finally victoriously passing
                                    the tremendous batteries of Vicksburg and New Orleans.</p>
                                <p>“Again, on the ocean we behold the little Monitor, the product of
                                    the genius of Ericsson, rescuing a whole squadron of wooden
                                    ships from the assaults of the gigantic iron-clad Merrimac.</p>
                                <p>“Day by day have we been called upon to bear testimony to the

                                <p>“Hand in hand with this navy, upon the same path of

                                    generous brave—have we known the officers of that army, of which
                                    we have now so distinguished a representative among us.</p>
                                <p>“In the generous hospitalities of the camp, gentlemen, as well as
                                    the cabin, have we had occasion to note the existence of similar
                                    characteristics, giving assurance, along with the goodness of
                                    their cause, that this people shall and deserve to be
                                    triumphant. I beg you, therefore, to assist me in doing honor to
                                    the toast I am about to offer, namely:</p>
                                <p>“The navy and army of the United States of America.”</p>
                                <p>In reply to this sentiment General Clay said:</p>
                                <p>“That it had been our good fortune to achieve improvements in
                                    naval art, as in all other practical sciences. The whole working
                                    class in our country is educated; <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295"

                                    the mechanical powers, is continually making improvements upon
                                    all old methods. The greatest inventions are made not only by
                                    the ‘boss,’ or master-workman, but by the laborers themselves.
                                    Russia has been the first of the nations to adopt our
                                    improvements. The new system of labor will place your people in
                                    the same category with our own, and when occasion shall occur, I
                                    doubt not you will be our teachers, as you are now, in a
                                    measure, the recipients of our dearly-bought knowledge. At all
                                    events the brotherhood of our growing navies, so auspiciously
                                    begun, I trust will last forever.”</p>
                                <p>The minister concluded his remarks by saying, he had heard it
                                    said, when Russian sailors saw an American ship they cried out,
                                    “There go our countrymen.” So now you will allow me to propose
                                    the health of “our admiral.”</p>
                                <p>The foregoing speech and toast were received with a storm of
                                    applause.</p>
                                <p>Captain Boutakoff, commander of the flag-ship, then rose and
                                    said:</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">“Gentlemen</hi>: We have drunk to the
                                    commander-in-chief of the navy and army of the United States, as
                                    well as to those branches of the public service collectively,
                                    and now I propose to offer a name which, in my opinion, is more
                                    representative of that navy than any other in America, by reason
                                    of the brilliant deeds its possessor has performed at New
                                    Orleans and elsewhere, and as I believe is at this time doing
                                    before Mobile. Let us drink in a bumper:</p>
                                <p>“To the health of the gallant and heroic Admiral Farragut.”</p>
                                <p>Admiral Lessoffsky begged permission to join to this toast:</p>
                                <p>“The health of the gallant admiral’s lady, the good and amiable
                                    Mrs. Farragut.” [Tumultuous cheering.]</p>
                                <p>General Greig here rose and said that he desired to propose a
                                    toast, which he was sure would be received and supported with
                                    sincere pleasure by all those who two days ago listened to the
                                    friendly sentiments so beautifully expressed, by the subject of
                                    it, at the legation of America. He begged the company to unite
                                    with him in heartily cheering:</p>
                                <p>“Mr. Bergh, the accomplished and universally esteemed secretary
                                    of the legation of the United States.”</p>
                                <p>The cheers with which this toast was received having subsided,
                                    Mr. Bergh, in substance, said:</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">“Gentlemen</hi>: ‘I am out of my element.’
                                    Notwithstanding many years of foreign travel, and a considerable
                                    portion of the time upon the sea, in spite of the most heroic
                                    and persistent efforts on my part to cultivate friendly
                                    relations with the monarch of the ocean, I regret to say that I
                                    have failed to make the least progress, and that we stand
                                    to-day, in one sense, in precisely the same attitude that we did
                                    at the beginning of our acquaintance, to wit, mutual distrust
                                    and abhorrence. It is true that the present rock-like immobility
                                    of your floating <hi rend="italic">château,</hi> the sumptuous
                                    repast before me, the delicious wines, the music, and the shouts
                                    of those iron throats on deck, but above all, the occasion which
                                    has broken their silence, have established a temporary truce
                                    between Neptune and myself; although I think, upon reflection,
                                    you will agree with me that the bit of road lying between us and
                                    the yacht we but just quitted in the ‘gig’ of our gallant
                                    admiral is rather rough and needs repairing. In a less material
                                    sense, however, I am a great admirer of the sea, and I am bold
                                    enough to assert that if ships would be more quiet in their
                                    deportment, or, what is still better, would only sail on land, I
                                    should have been an admiral long ago. But as human art and
                                    science are not likely to fill up the ocean, nor reform the
                                    behavior of vessels, it follows that I shall never be promoted,
                                    although permitted, as heretofore, to contemplate its poetic
                                    beauties of fathomless depth, of boundless space, and mysterious
                                    solitude. These and other more important associations,
                                    gentlemen, serve to render glorious the profession which you by
                                    your individual bearing and gallant deeds have imparted such
                                    high lustre to. Who can contemplate without emotion a numerous
                                    and mighty fleet about setting out for a distant <pb n="296"
                                        xml:id="pg_296" facs="0316"/>land; having for its mission
                                    the restoration of that equilibrium of international obligation,
                                    which pride, passion, or ignorance for a time may have
                                    disturbed?</p>
                                <p>But, gentlemen, you have not the time, nor I the power, to do
                                    justice to such grand considerations. Suffer me, therefore, to
                                    thank you, in such inadequate terms as I have at my command, for
                                    the honor you have done me in accepting the toast just offered
                                    by the distinguished gentleman who has this day so kindly acted
                                    as the escort of the minister of the United States among you,
                                    and to ask you to lend your acclamations to those of General
                                    Clay, and my own, when I offer the name of Rear-Admiral Greig,
                                    coupled with that of the governor of Cronstadt, the officers and
                                    crew of this Russo-American squadron.</p>
                                <p>The nine cheers demanded by Mr. Bergh being given, and counted by
                                    him as they were pronounced—</p>
                                <p>General Greig again rose and said: That the toast to Mr. Farragut
                                    reminded him of the one without which no company on board the
                                    vessels of this squadron ever separated until due honor had been
                                    done it; therefore, in rising, as he did, for the last time on
                                    this occasion, for the purpose of announcing it, he would
                                    premise by saying that it was a sentiment eminently calculated
                                    to disturb the fictitious repose of many of his brother officers
                                    present; and to substitute, therefore, much sighing and blushing
                                    on their part, notwithstanding their wonted manly indifference
                                    to menace and danger of every other sort. The truth is,
                                    gentlemen, the hearts of very many of this squadron have been
                                    stolen from them by the fair girls of America; and, however odd
                                    it may seem, with a full knowledge of the enormity of the deed,
                                    I rise to propose: “The health and happiness of the ladies of
                                    America.”</p>
                                <p>This toast was received by a tornado of applause, amidst which
                                    General Clay rose and proposed:</p>
                                <p>“The ladies of Russia.”</p>
                                <p>Which was in like manner responded to with the most vehement
                                    cheers, tigers, &amp;c., and by which the repast was concluded;
                                    and soon thereafter the minister and secretary returned on board
                                    the yacht, delighted with their reception, and immediately
                                    started for St. Petersburg, amid the roar of cannon, the shouts
                                    of their gallant entertainers, and the manning of the rigging of
                                    all the ships lying in the roadstead.</p>
                                <p>And thus terminated one of those pleasing manifestations of
                                    international courtesy which, unhappily for the peace,
                                    prosperity, and permanent civilization of the world, are far too
                                    rare in our time.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Hiram Sibley embarked on Wednesday
                            last to visit St. Petersburg. He goes out as representative of the
                            association which has assumed the construction of the intercontinental
                            telegraph between America and Asia across Behring’s straits.</p>
                        <p>I am informed and believe that the company has obtained adequate
                            subscriptions to its stock, and has already made important orders for
                            materials for their great work.</p>
                        <p>You are aware of the deep interest with which this government regards the
                            enterprise. The President. desires that Mr. Sibley may find needful
                            support and co-operation at St. Petersburg. With this view, I send you
                            two copies of an official letter which I addressed to Mr. Chandler, of
                            the Senate Committee on Commerce, in which the argument in favor of the
                            enterprise is discussed. I have to request you to present Mr. Sibley to
                            Prince Grortchacow, and, if leave shall be obtained, to present Mr.
                            Sibley also to his Majesty the Emperor; and I have further to request
                            that you will afford all other facilities in your power to Mr. Sibley,
                            that he may receive the Emperor’s favorable consideration for the
                            project. I shall deem it a favor if his Imperial Majesty and the Prince
                            will deign to receive the copies of my letter before mentioned. It will
                            serve to show them how sincerely desirous this government is to
                            cultivate an intimate friendship with Russia, and how carefully we
                            follow here in her great cause of moral, material, and social
                            melioration. You will be at liberty to read this note to Prince

                            do right in giving P. M. D. Collins due credit for the projection of the
                            enterprise, which has been so intelligently seconded by the State

                        <p>The imperial government has just transmitted to me a copy of a decision
                            of the council of the empire concerning vessels driven into the ports of
                            Russia under stress. According to this decision, all vessels that put
                            into Russian ports, not for the purpose of carrying on commercial
                            operations, but in the case of greater force, (putting in under stress,)
                            for instance of weather, chase by an enemy, average, want of coal on
                            board a steamer, or scantiness of provisions, shall be exempt from all
                            navigation dues.</p>
                        <p>This measure applies to foreign vessels, as well as to Russian bottoms,
                            without any distinction.</p>
                        <p>The imperial government inquires of me whether a similar law exists in
                            the United States, and, in the contrary case, charges me to enter on
                            negotiations with the federal government, and to invite it to adopt
                            analogous measures towards Russian vessels, as an act of the reciprocity
                            which has always made the base of transactions between the two
                            governments.</p>

                            <p>On the 17th of February last his Majesty the Emperor deigned to
                                sanction a decision of the council of the empire, of which the
                                following are the provisions:</p>
                            <p>1. All merchant vessels, as well masted and sea-going as coasters,
                                and without masts, arriving at the port of Cronstadt, must pay to
                                the benefit of the municipal revenues of Cronstadt a special tax for
                                their cleansing and the removal of their filth, to wit: On each
                                voyage, masted sea-going vessels, fifty copeks each mast; and
                                vessels not masted and coasters, ten copeks each vessel.</p>
                            <p>2. The arrangements relative to the cleansing and removal of filth
                                from vessels, as well as for the collection of the duty for which
                                they are liable on this head, are made in the general order in force
                                by the municipality of Cronstadt, either by means of letting out by
                                public auction, or by commission, as it shall judge proper.</p>
                            <p>3. In virtue of the laws in force, the military governor of Cronstadt
                                is charged, as the immediate head of the city of Cronstadt, to
                                attend to the execution of the present regulation.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary of State</hi>: According to existing
                            laws of Russia, every foreigner who becomes a subject of Russia, and at
                            a later time renounces this character, is obliged to pay before his
                            departure the equivalent for the taxes for three years, and some other
                            imposts, to obtain the right to export his property.</p>
                        <p>The imperial government has informed me that under a new regulation the
                            subjects and citizens of powers by whom the dues above mentioned are not
                            enforced will be exonerated therefrom.</p>
                        <p>I have, in consequence, the honor, Mr. Secretary of State, to request you
                            to inform me if Russians, who are naturalized Americans, and who
                            afterwards return to Russia, taking their property with them, are
                            subjected to any imposts. Accept, Mr. Secretary of State, the assurance
                            of my very high consideration.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary of State</hi>: In the new exequaturs
                            which have been issued by the President of the United States to Russian
                            consuls, the phrase “consuls may enjoy the privileges stipulated by
                            treaties” has been introduced in place of this: “consuls may enjoy the
                            privileges granted to the most favored nations.”</p>
                        <p>Article VIII of our treaty of commerce stipulates, “the two contracting
                            parties shall have the liberty of having in their respective ports
                            consuls, vice-consuls, agents, and commissioners of their own
                            appointment, who shall enjoy the same privileges and powers as those of
                            the most favored nations.”</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that this article indicates clearly that our consuls must
                            enjoy the prerogatives which are or shall be granted to those of other
                            nations; at any rate, I wish to know, in this respect, the opinion of
                            the federal government; and I venture to request you, Mr. Secretary of
                            State, to give me information on this point, so that I may transmit it
                            to the imperial government.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, Mr. Secretary of State, the assurance of my very high

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 16th– 28th instant, on the subject of the
                            new exequaturs which have been issued by the President to the Russian
                            consuls in this country.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I have the honor to state that the object of this measure was
                            not to derogate from the stipulation in the treaty between the United
                            States and Russia to which you refer. The phrase “most favored nations,”
                            however, has been found in practice to be somewhat indefinite in its
                            character. If any favor is extended by this government to a consul of a
                            foreign power, the same favor will be extended by the executive
                            government of the United States to the consul of Russia, upon the
                            assurance that the United States consuls in that empire enjoy a similar
                            favor. Treaties are in this country, however, subject to judicial
                            interpretation, and the rights and privileges of foreign consuls are
                            placed by the Constitution under the direct guardianship of the Supreme
                            Court.</p>
                        <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0323"/>
                        <p>It was deemed advisable to reserve in the new form of the exequatur a
                            discrimination which might be supposed to be called for by the special
                            consular conventions which have been entered into by this government
                            with France, the Netherlands, and New Granada.</p>
                        <p>If the imperial government should think proper to negotiate with that of
                            the United States a consular convention, similar to those above referred
                            to, an overture for that purpose will be willingly entertained.</p>

                        <p>The 50th anniversary of the expulsion of the French domination was
                            celebrated here yesterday with great eclat. It was a striking ovation to
                            the House of Orange.</p>
                        <p>The subject of the proposed European congress occupies much
                            attention.</p>
                        <p>The powers are engaged at present in ascertaining, in advance, just what
                            is to be done, and how. If they can come to an agreement on the points
                            of difference, the congress will meet to ratify this preliminary
                            understanding. But this is simply trying again to settle by diplomacy
                            questions which diplomacy has been endeavoring in vain for months and
                            years to adjust. Still, if there is a will, there will be found a way. *
                            * * * *</p>
                        <p>The cotton question in Europe is assuming a new phase. The production,
                            which last year furnished half the ordinary supply, is expected to be
                            increased to three-quarters this. The enhanced price is producing an
                            extraordinary outflow of the precious metals from northern and western
                            Europe to the east—to Asia Minor, to Egypt, to India, and even further
                            east. Extensive railroad enterprises, necessary to facilitate the
                            increasing transportation, co-operate to the same end. The result is a
                            sudden and sharp money pressure, which threatens to be aggravated. It
                            will probably react on us, and stimulate the drain of gold from the
                            United States during the year to come, and the more that Europe is going
                            to require but little of our breadstuffs, by reason of the abundance of
                            the late harvest.</p>

                            been received. If I do not improve the information by comments of my
                            own, concerning the changing aspect of European politics, which you are
                            so faithful in giving me, you will not, therefore, conclude that the
                            information itself is undervalued. I may perhaps, without impropriety,
                            express an opinion that so far as the proper interests of the United
                            States are concerned, we are witnessing rather the beginning of a
                            dispersion than an increase of the war cloud.</p>
                        <p>The military situation here is gathering new interest. The chief theatre
                            of the civil war is now Tennessee and Georgia; operations of great
                            significance are going on there, and the telegraph will not improbably
                            convey intelligence <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0325"/>of results
                            which it would, under the circumstances, be idle for me now to make a
                            subject for speculation.</p>
                        <p>You will read with much satisfaction the account of the successful
                            occupation of the mouth of the Rio Grande and the port of Brownsville,
                            in Texas. I need not explain the significance of that event.</p>

                        <p>You will have learned that the proposed congress of sovereigns and their
                            ministers at Paris is likely to fall through in consequence of England’s
                            declining to enter it. The congress meant the Polish question and
                            nothing else.</p>
                        <p>On this subject England and Austria have held the reins on the French
                            Emperor all summer, and, doubtless, they will continue to act together
                            on it.</p>

                        <p>The great successes of our late military operations in Tennessee and
                            Kentucky, of which you speak, are most gratifying. They seem to prelude
                            the collapse of the rebellion. They have a double force, coming, as they
                            do, at the same time with the confession of its ruined finances. Nobody
                            here is bold enough to even speculate on the prospect of the schemes put
                            forth by Mr. Davis and Mr. Memminger to retrieve the financial position.
                            They are simply regarded as futile and impossible. The confession of Mr.
                            Memminger that their cause is ruined unless success attends these
                            schemes, becomes broadly significant in the light of this judgment. To
                            the European mind the insurgent struggle to contend longer against the
                            Union arms thus takes on the phase of mere desperation.</p>
                        <p>Great alarm is felt at the progress of the movement in Germany, which is
                            now assuming a revolutionary aspect by demanding the forcible
                            dismemberment of Denmark in defiance of treaties. The helplessness of
                            Denmark excites sympathy, but does not secure assistance, which is the
                            one thing needful. The question of the duchies, so long menacing, must
                            now be solved one way or another. Apprehensions are beginning to be felt
                            that its solution may even involve a struggle between the popular and
                            legitimate interests in Germany itself.</p>
                        <p>The European congress falls through under cover of propositions for a
                            modified form of it in the shape of ministerial discussions. This is
                            only to enter the endless circle of diplomacy by the same door from
                            which the original proposition for a congress issued.</p>
                        <p>There are no longer any alliances in Europe. But it is not to be inferred
                            from this that the hostile spirit of the great powers towards one
                            another is increasing. It seems rather to be lessening.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The ministerial crisis of which I have
                            spoken has culminated in the resignation of the minister of foreign
                            affairs, Mr. Van der Maesen. His place is temporarily filled by the
                            minister of marine, Mr. Kattendyke.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The King sought me out at the annual gala ball at the palace on the 4th
                            instant, to say that he desired, as King of the Netherlands, to say to
                            me, as the representative of the United States, that he regarded our
                            struggle with deep interest, and wished to express to me what he really
                            felt—a sincere sympathy with the United States government as an old and
                            faithful friend of Holland. The King is a truthful man, and I have never
                            heard him <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0327"/>accused of saying
                            what he does not mean. His mother is a sister of the late Emperor
                            Nicholas, and he is said to have strong Russian sympathies.</p>
                        <p>Nobody seems to be able to predict what will result from the Danish
                            complications, but the apprehension of war is general. England would
                            like to unite with France and compel a settlement of the difficulty, but
                            the latter feels offended at England’s refusal to attend the proposed
                            congress, and declines the enterprise; at which England, on her part, is
                            at once huffed and embarrassed. Her statesmen do not wish to see Denmark
                            dismembered, but they will not threaten to take up arms alone against
                            Germany to prevent it. The situation tends to increase the irritation
                            between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>The German Diet, in pushing for what it terms federal execution in
                            Holstein, has roused a popular sentiment which goes much faster than the
                            governments which projected the movement. Among the leaders of it is the
                            Duke Ernest, of Saxe-Coburg. He stands sponsor for the now troublesome
                            Pretender, the Duke of Angustenberg. The great ruling houses of Germany
                            would be glad to see him lose his own little duchy by way of penalty for
                            what they regard as his mischief-making propensities. These growing
                            European troubles occupy the governments sufficiently to keep them from
                            devoting any unusual share of attention to our concerns, which they are
                            quite content to continue to leave to our government to manage.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            despatch of December 22, No. 137. It is a critical moment in the affairs
                            of Europe. The point of collision between the German and Danish troops
                            in Schleswig-Holstein is almost reached, and any day may witness the
                            breaking out of war. Of course the utmost solicitude is felt for the
                            consequences. The ill blood raised in France by the refusal of England
                            to attend the congress is conspicuously exhibited by the continued
                            refusal of the former power to act in concert with England to prevent a
                            rupture. To what extent the Emperor proposes to carry this policy
                            remains to be seen.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The King has again spoken to me concerning
                            our prospects, and desired to know if I had communicated to the
                            President what he previously said to me.</p>
                        <p>I know of no new developments of European politics relating to our
                            affairs that possess interest.</p>
                        <p>The war cloud lightens up this week. Strong hopes are now entertained
                            that a peaceful solution of the Schleswig-Holstein question may even yet
                            be found.</p>
                        <p>Our enemies are making use of the present lull in military operations to
                            renewedly argue in the press the hopelessness of the attempt of the
                            government to subdue the rebellion. They never fail to make the most of
                            their opportunities.</p>
                        <p>We still remain without a minister of foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>I have been several times inquired of when our government would probably
                            act on the treaty.</p>
                        <p>I am sorry to say that our finances, which with our friends are always a
                            subject of deep solicitude, are not regarded here with the same
                            hopefulness that seems to prevail at home. It is believed we want less
                            legal tender and more taxation. Confidence is wanting that we can
                            maintain our financial system for any length of time if the existing
                            disproportion between income and expenditures is suffered to go on. This
                            distrust is telling on our securities. Our 1882 6’s, which have been as
                            high as 80 within a few months, are down to 67 in Amsterdam. Yet we have
                            no better friends in Europe than the Dutch, nor any who would be more
                            glad to see our stocks rule high.</p>

                            reduce <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0329"/>armaments in Europe, and
                            yet they at the same time pursue a system that aggravates and prolongs
                            war in America, and forces upon the United States a policy of military
                            preparation incongruous with their history and uncongenial with their
                            natural disposition.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since I wrote you last, the apprehended
                            war on the Dano-German question has broken out, and appears to have
                            ended almost as soon as begun. It is feared that injustice will be done
                            to Denmark in the settlement that will follow the invasion of Schleswig.
                            Prussia and Austria have a troublesome popular ferment to appease, and
                            it would seem that it must be allayed at the expense of Denmark. Here in
                            Europe all sympathies are with the Danes. The active movements of the
                            small German powers since the late military successes of Austria and
                            Prussia, to prevent the latter from thwarting their desires in the
                            settlement of the question, forebode further difficulties; and among the
                            contingencies of the future a revolutionary contest in Germany itself
                            still holds a prominent place.</p>
                        <p>We are still without a minister of foreign affairs. I have not received a
                            copy of the diplomatic correspondence of 1863.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of January 27, No. 121, has
                            been received. The President was promptly made acquainted with the
                            kindly sentiments and good wishes of the King of Holland, which you
                            communicated to me in your No. 118, and they were accepted with sincere
                            satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>Laborious efforts have been made from time to time, chiefly by British
                            statesmen, to prove that the concession of a belligerent naval character
                            by their government to the insurgents in this country was right, and
                            even that it was necessary. The United States have never conceded either
                            the justice or the necessity of that proceeding, but, on the contrary,
                            they declared at first, and have ever since maintained, that it was as
                            ungenerous and unfriendly as it was exceptional. Having been followed by
                            the concurrence of the other maritime powers, as it is understood in
                            some cases upon considerations of prudence, and in others upon the
                            suggestions of sympathy with Great Britain, that important measure has
                            secured to none of the maritime powers any real advantage, while it has
                            deeply affected the United States. Steadily adhering to the prudent
                            policy which their exposed condition suggested, they are at last
                            surmounting what other states have insisted upon regarding as fatal
                            dangers. But, as they feel more assured of coming out of the
                            revolutionary storm, the people of this country <pb n="310"
                                xml:id="pg_310" facs="0330"/>become more and more keenly sensible of
                            the injuries which they received from friendly hands during their peril.
                            European statesmen, on the other hand, are beginning to consider what
                            will be the form and measure of the atonement that the United States
                            will claim at the hands of states which unnecessarily and unkindly have
                            lent aid and sympathies to the insurgents.</p>
                        <p>It is to be expected, of course, that the United States, after passing
                            the present crisis, will seek to maintain the position they have
                            hitherto held in the commonwealth of nations, and to improve the
                            resources with which Providence has blessed them. But it is no secret
                            that the President thinks justice and magnanimity are safer and surer
                            guides for a republic than jealousy and aggression. It is, moreover,
                            hardly to be expected of any people that they will be content to
                            practice these virtues towards other nations which persevere in
                            injurious and wantonly offensive courses. Desirous, therefore, that when
                            our domestic war shall cease, the natural controversies that grew out of
                            it may also be brought to an end, I have been authorized, whenever
                            circumstances seemed propitious, to invite the maritime powers to
                            re-examine their attitude and to resume their original relations towards
                            the United States. I know how hard it is for a state to retrace an
                            erroneous course so long as it can be followed without immediate peril;
                            and therefore I am not surprised or discouraged with the failure that
                            has thus far attended the appeals which we have made not more earnestly
                            in the present interest of our national cause than in the ultimate
                            interest of universal peace and harmony. But if we are right in our
                            belief that the American Union is coming safely and purified out of the
                            fire through which, for its early acceptance of human bondage as a
                            political element in its organization, it was doomed to pass, then it is
                            clear that the maritime powers would do wisely in promptly receding from
                            the position which, in a moment of precipitancy, they unwisely adopted
                            in regard to the insurrection. If the United States survive the
                            struggle, all of the maritime powers must, sooner or later, revise their
                            attitude of which we complain. The power that first perceives and
                            performs this duty will be distinguished, and will reap the rewards of
                            wisdom and virtue.</p>
                        <p>I am obliged to confess that it is not now expected that the treaty in
                            regard to negro emigration will be ratified. The American people have
                            advanced to a new position in regard to slavery and the African class
                            since the President, in obedience to their prevailing wishes, accepted
                            the policy of colonization. Now not only their free labor but their
                            military service also is appreciated and accepted.</p>
                        <p>The views of our finances taken by our friends in Holland are neither
                            unjust nor unexpected. They are accepted by the Secretary of the
                            Treasury, and, I believe, by Congress. I think I can promise that the
                            increased taxation necessary for sustaining the public credit will be
                            wisely imposed by the legislature and cheerfully borne by the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p>At this distance from the theatre of action we do not attempt a solution
                            of the political problem in Europe, but it surprises us to see how slow
                            the statesmen of that continent are in finding that their labors upon it
                            are not at all rendered lighter by the injurious policy they are
                            practicing in regard to American affairs.</p>
                        <p>The campaign in the west is opening with a gratifying display of
                            steadiness and energy. The elections which have recently occurred in
                            Louisiana; in New Hampshire, and especially in New York, indicate that
                            the impulsive movement of April, 1861, has ripened at last into
                            enlightened and irrevocable resolution to maintain the integrity of the
                            Union, and to place our political system on broad and sure foundations.
                            It is not under such circumstances that we are likely to be disturbed by
                            rumors of dangers of interference by foreign powers.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: We have at last a minister of foreign
                            affairs in Mr. J. Cremers, of Gronengen, the centre of liberal politics
                            in this kingdom.</p>
                        <p>This appointment does not involve any change in the policy of the present
                            ministry, of which Mr. Thorbecke is still the head; and as the ministry
                            has already taken its ground on the question of granting belligerent
                            rights to the insurgents, and argued out a reply to the suggestion that
                            it would be well for them to review their position, I suppose it is
                            useless at this time to ask a reconsideration of their views.</p>
                        <p>I am addressed again by Mr. Marx, our new consul at Amsterdam, who, it
                            seems, is still in that city, in regard to his commission and exequatur,
                            but I have still to reply to him that I have not yet received the
                            duplicate commission for which he waits.</p>
                        <p>I indulge in no review of the political situation of Europe, feeling that
                            it would be perhaps alike uninteresting and superfluous. Ever since
                            England and France broke up on the question of a congress at Paris,
                            affairs have been in a more than usually unsettled condition. France
                            continues to hold an attitude of reserve, and appears to enjoy the
                            embarrassments of England in failing to make anything out of her active
                            negotiations between Germany and Denmark.</p>
                        <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0332"/>
                        <p>People talk about the danger of the war spreading, but I confess my
                            inability to see any solid foundation for such a fear. There is nobody
                            to spread it but France, and she is just now as much isolated as
                            England. In the event of war, on any existing issue, she would be pretty
                            sure to have all three of the other great continental powers opposed to
                            her; and I believe the discord between this power and England to be now
                            so great, that they would not pull together in any hostile policy.</p>
                        <p>The situation, therefore, with all its uncertainties, I think is, in the
                            main, peace between the leading powers.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>So far as we are concerned, I see nothing that bears upon our interests,
                            either for or against, in the present or prospective action of any
                            European government. They all wait, if without hostility, yet without
                            sympathy, to see what will come of the contest in which we are
                            engaged.</p>
                        <p>This government receives with regret the intimation that the treaty with
                            regard to emigration to Surinam, lately negotiated here, is not likely
                            to be ratified. Surinam wants labor, and the colonial department is
                            anxious to have the credit of making a treaty that looks to the
                            obtaining of it. I have no doubt, however, of the good policy on our
                            part of rejecting the treaty.</p>

                        <p>The London conference on the Dano-German question will have great
                            difficulties to overcome, as you are aware, but it is presumed that it

                            peace. A favorite plan of settlement seems to be the union of the north

                            remainder to go with Holstein into the German Confederation, under the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The quieting tenor of the Senate action on
                            the Mexican question has restored the equilibrium on the stock exchange,
                            and our securities rebounded yesterday to just the same extent they fell
                            last week. The general tendency of prices is, however, downward, and has
                            been so for some time past. The slow progress of the war accounts, in
                            the main, for this decline; but besides the general reason, there is
                            another. The pushing of numerous new paper banks into existence during
                            such a convulsion as rages in America, is regarded with great distrust
                            by Dutch financiers, and it is believed will complicate still further
                            our already overburdened and embarrassed finances. Instead of more
                            banking machines, these conservative people insist that we have too many
                            already. They say we have a plethora of paper money, and that this is
                            our difficulty and danger. They ask, “Why add to the list of paper money
                            banks, which cannot resume specie payments when the storm is over? The
                            country will be deluged by the issues of the new banks, and their
                            influence on the question of resumption will be pernicious and tend to
                            prolong the period of disaster.” They admit that if the machinery was
                            necessary to enable the government to place their loans, or to furnish a
                            circulating medium, they could understand why the new banks should be
                            created. But as they are evidently needed for neither purpose, the
                            object of calling into existence such a potent element of expansion and
                            speculation is beyond their comprehension.</p>
                        <p>There is only one point of view in which this policy is regarded with
                            complacency. It is that the general deluge of paper likely to inundate
                            the channels of circulation through their operations will, by
                            discrediting all banks, throw the country all the sooner back upon a
                            specie currency. They do not overlook the fact that the abundance of the
                            precious metals now fast filling the world may render this transaction
                            comparatively easy, and thus be unattended by the convulsions which such
                            radical changes have hitherto produced.</p>
                        <p>But any way the opinion reigns that the new banks will only make a bad
                            matter worse, and that when the end comes they will be able to lighten
                            nobody’s load, but will be just as deep in the mud as everybody else
                            will be in the mire. Whereas, if the creation of a national bank, or a
                            chain of banks, based mainly on government securities, were deferred
                            until the government circulation had to be funded with a view to a

                        <p>The internal affairs of this country continue in a highly prosperous
                            state, and the finances of the kingdom are peculiarly flourishing, owing
                            to the present high prices of tropical productions. This is not the only
                            country in the Old World which has derived commercial and financial
                            advantages from our disorders.</p>
                        <p>The public feeling continues feverish over Danish affairs. I do not
                            suppose the war will involve other powers besides those already engaged,
                            but no man can say what may result from the odious pressure put upon
                            Denmark by Germany. It looks now as if there would be no eompromise, and
                            as if Denmark would be forcibly dismembered.</p>
                        <p>Our securities continue depressed. The doubt now expressed is, not of the
                            unwillingness of the country to go on with the war, but of its ability
                            to prosecute it. This is but one of the ever-varying phases of
                            continental opinion which has marked the progress of our contest from
                            the beginning. How soon it will give place to another depends on our
                            military operations.</p>

                        <p>Recent advices from the eastern States of Mexico represent that the
                            national cause has revived in that region since the flight of Vidaurri,
                            the disloyal governor of Coahuila and New Leon. Our attitude in regard
                            to the conflict in Mexico remains unchanged. We still continue to see
                            there a war between France and Mexico in regard to which we are, as in
                            all other foreign conflicts, neutrals.</p>
                        <p>Our spring campaign has opened, and it may be expected that its events
                            and vicissitudes will for a time abate the interest with which we have
                            been watching the commotions of Europe.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of April 27, No. 130, has
                            been received. I thank you for the interesting information it brings me
                            on the subject of American credit in the Netherlands. The embarrassment
                            which you have witnessed there has been equally observable here. In
                            fact, financial interests seem to know neither geographical nor
                            political restraints. If we understand here the fiscal system of the
                            Treasury Department, it is designed to substitute for divers conflicting
                            banking institutions, deriving their authority from the States and
                            responsible only to them, and using State and private securities as a
                            basis of circulation, one general system of many united parts, deriving
                            its authority exclusively from the national government, responsible to
                            that government only, and employing the stocks of the United States as
                            the basis of circulation. It seems to me to approach as nearly as
                            possible to what I regard as the most effective fiscal agency the
                            government could create—a bank of the United States, with responsible
                            branches in the several States and Territories.</p>
                        <p>The new system still struggles in Congress with the State banks, and the
                            dispute hinders and delays the final establishment of the treasury
                            system. This circumstance is not favorable to the sale of government
                            securities. The market is now affected by other adverse circumstances.
                            We have had importations so excessive as to require a sudden and unusual
                            addition of fifty per cent. to the imposts. Finally spring came again,
                            and all the armies of the Union did not move as quickly as the dogwood
                            tree flowered in the forest, and then there were reverses in Louisiana,
                            disappointment of unreasonable anticipations in Mississippi, and
                            surprises by raiders at Fort Pillow, on the Mississippi, and by a clumsy
                            iron-clad at Plymouth in North Carolina. So there was discouragement,
                            then apprehension, then despondency, and of course gold went up, and
                            government stocks went down. As if to increase the panic, all these
                            incidents occurred at the time when the Secretary of the Treasury had
                            reduced the rate of interest upon permanent loans he was applying for,
                            from six per centum to five per centum per annum. The public credit is
                            maintaining a vigorous struggle, however, with its enemies. Congress is
                            likely, at last, to agree upon and perfect the bank and revenue bills.
                            The augmented tariff is checking importations. The campaign astonishes
                            the country by its success, and promises a speedy end of the civil war;
                            and the new loan, bearing only five per centum, is absorbed by the <pb
                                n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0336"/>country at the rate of nearly a
                            million a day. So I feel myself authorized to hope that we shall safely
                            stem and soon overcome the adverse fiscal currents at home, and, having
                            done this, shall find smoother waters to float upon abroad.</p>

                        <p>A profound interest reigns everywhere in Europe over the intelligence
                            brought by the two last mails from America.</p>
                        <p>The news of General Grant’s advance into Virginia, and his apparently
                            doubtful fortune, have alternately awakened the hopes and fears of every
                            friend of the United States. The latest information by telegraph to the
                            14th only heightens the solicitude which has been painfully felt for so
                            many days. Up to this point it does not seem clear whether General Grant
                            will be stopped or go on.</p>
                        <p>The news by the Scotia, due the last of this week, is looked for with an
                            interest hardly surpassed by any past epoch of the war.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The anxieties in regard to the military
                            situation at home are not wholly relieved by the latest intelligence,
                            notwithstanding General Grant’s marked successes.</p>
                        <p>Grant has acquired a European reputation, and the sneers at military
                            incapacity in America are ended. But the fact that General Sherman finds
                            no enemy in Georgia leads to a suspicion that the entire confederate
                            force is being concentrated to be thrown upon Grant, and that, however
                            tenacious and indomitable he may be, there is danger that he may find
                            himself suddenly overwhelmed by superior forces.</p>
                        <p>If this perhaps over-cautious suspicion shall be found to be groundless,
                            very significant conclusions will be drawn as to the waning strength of
                            the rebellion.</p>
                        <p>Meantime alarm and surprise are deeply felt over the financial situation.
                            The continued issue of legal tenders, until they had reached near 700
                            millions on the 14th of May, and the consequent continued rise in the
                            price of gold and of all commodities of commerce, while our six per
                            cent. loans are quoted at from 6 to 12 per cent. above par, is a
                            condition of things which is looked upon with astonishment by the
                            European financier. Why this ruinous inflation should be permitted, when
                            it is plain it could be remedied by a six per cent. loan, quite
                            surpasses the comprehension of observers here. The opinion prevails that
                            the apparent effort of Mr. Chase to save one per cent. of interest is
                            costing him an enormous increase of the principal of his loans, and
                            unnecessarily precipitating a financial convulsion of the most alarming
                            character.</p>
                        <p>I beg you to believe it is with the deepest pain I report these
                            criticisms, and the more so that they are accompanied with the
                            expression of disappointed expectations and the profoundest fears of the
                            result of Mr. Chase’s apparent policy.</p>
                        <p>Affairs in Europe are unwarlike. The conference at London on the
                            Dano-German question, though dragging but slowly along, yet gives
                            promise of a settlement on the basis I suggested several weeks ago,
                            namely, that of the severance of the whole of Holstein and the half of
                            Schleswig from the Danish monarchy.</p>

                        <p>The results of the views on our financial affairs, which I had the honor

                            government securities at Amsterdam, from about 60 to 53, in little more
                            than a week; a point much lower than they have ever touched before.</p>
                        <p>You will have heard before this reaches you the very gratifying news of
                            the destruction of the Alabama by the Kearsarge.</p>
                        <p>At the suggestion of Mr. Dayton, I am trying to discover what Dutch
                            persons have been purchasing the two corvettes built at Bordeaux for the

                            you to go upon active service. For the purpose of information I give you
                            a copy of three despatches which have been just now received from Mr.
                            Dayton, and of my reply thereto of this date. It will be your duty to
                            ascertain the truth about the sale of the two vessels, Yeddo and Osacco,
                            which Arman, the ship-builder at Bordeaux, built for the insurgents, and

                            be delivered in Amsterdam. It will be your first duty to take care that
                            these vessels are not even despatched from a port in the Netherlands, or
                            otherwise permitted to fall into the hands of the insurgents; and for
                            that purpose, if necessary, you will address yourself to his Majesty’s
                            government. Further, if it shall become necessary, the Kearsarge, which
                            is now in European waters, and the Niagara, which will soon be there,
                            will be subject to your requisition. You will examine all the
                            circumstances, and advise us whether, in your opinion, it will be
                            needful to increase our naval force in the German ocean. The diplomatic
                            correspondence, of which a copy is herewith sent you, will give you the
                            substance of the representations which we have thought proper heretofore
                            to address to the British and French governments against the equipment
                            and clearing of hostile expeditions. You will draw from that source such
                            arguments as you may have occasion to address to the government at the
                            Hague.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I received information a few days ago from Mr. Dayton, at Paris, that one
                            of the corvettes (the Yeddo) built at Bordeaux, and supposed to be for
                            the rebels, left that port for Amsterdam on the 22d instant, the
                            allegation being that the vessel had been purchased by an Amsterdam
                            house. It is now one week since the ship left Bordeaux, but she has not
                            yet arrived. It is my impression she did not put to sea with any
                            intention of coming hither, if she is really intended for the rebels,
                            though Mr. Dayton seems to be of a different opinion. The voyage ought
                            to be performed in three or four days under steam. I have requested this
                            government, in case any such vessel shall appear in Netherland waters,
                            and a Dutch register be applied for, that it shall not be granted, nor
                            the ship be allowed to leave under the Netherland flag, unless her
                            owners shall first remove all suspicion that she is designed to make war
                            on the United States. This government is well disposed towards us.</p>
                        <p>The London conference, you will have observed, after approaching,
                            considering, and seemingly well-nigh adopting the plan of dividing
                            Schleswig, as a basis of peace, have finally broken up without doing
                            anything towards its restoration. Its proceedings are a sorry commentary
                            upon the modern idea of settling national disputes by arbitration.</p>

                        <p>It now appears that the two corvettes built at Bordeaux for the rebels,
                            one of which was expected at Amsterdam last week, have been purchased by
                            the Prussian government.</p>
                        <p>The day after my last despatch was written I received information that
                            the Yeddo had arrived at the mouth of the Weser, and a few days later
                            that the Osacca had been purchased for the same destination. I informed
                            Mr. Dayton, and I suppose he had time to communicate the facts to you by
                            the last mail.</p>
                        <p>A good deal of agitation exists in Europe over the failure of the London
                            conference. There is now more apprehension of complications involving
                            the peace of Europe than has existed at any time since the war broke
                            out.</p>

                        <p>My reflections and observations here have led me to conclude that the

                            Florida and Alabama. With the existing scarcity of our vessels on the
                            ocean, there is little to encourage such piratical enterprises.</p>

                        <p>I do not doubt, however, that the rebels are struggling to get some
                            ironclads afloat, which will enable them to break the line of our
                            blockade, or to retake New Orleans, &amp;c. The class of ships we have
                            here would not interfere with such a design. The Niagara and Sacramento
                            are at Antwerp; Commodore Craven, of the Niagara, informs me he is
                            without orders.</p>
                        <p>I have heard nothing more of the remaining corvette built at Bordeaux,
                            the Osacca.</p>
                        <p>The fact that the Yeddo, though kept from the hands of the insurgents,
                            (perhaps voluntarily sold by them,) has been allowed to pass into the
                            possession of a belligerent in Europe, engaged in a war against a power
                            with whom France is at peace, affords serious grounds for suspicion that
                            the rebels may yet obtain iron-clads from French ports. * * * *</p>
                        <p>Your telegraph in relation to the purchase of the corvettes reached me
                            through Mr. Dayton.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of July 20, No. 143, has
                            been received. I learn from it that you are by no means free of
                            apprehension that the insurgents may yet get in French ports iron-clads
                            adapted to open New Orleans or break the blockade, and you observe that
                            the ships-of-war we have in European waters are not well calculated to
                            prevent such a proceeding. I have cause to believe that the French
                            government will suffer no armed iron-clads or other ships-of-war to go
                            out of French ports to make war against the United States, and that our
                            naval force in Europe would be useful in hindering the departure of not
                            only armed wooden vessels but also of unarmed iron vessels. It is
                            important for us to know to what extent the remaining of that naval
                            force is advantageous, and I hope, <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322"
                                facs="0342"/>therefore, that you will seek an opportunity informally
                            to confer upon this question, not only with the commanders of these
                            vessels but also with our representatives at London, Paris, and
                            Brussels, and communicate to me the result of the conference. Your
                            special expenses in performing this duty will be paid. I give copies of

                        <p>Since I received your directions to confer with the ministers at
                            Brussels, Paris, and London, and with the commanders of our naval
                            vessels in these waters in regard to the naval force required here, I
                            have visited the Niagara and Sacramento, and have likewise consulted our
                            ministers above named on the subject. I did not see the commander of the
                            Iroquois before he left for his distant station.</p>

                        <p>Another thing that I believe is deemed, on all hands, to be requisite to
                            an efficient service here, is to have our ships formally placed under
                            one commander, so that unity of action may be secured when needed. This
                            arrangement would devolve a responsibility of oversight over the whole
                            field, which does not now exist.</p>
                        <p>The war vessels which are being constructed in France by private
                            builders, some iron-clad and some not, are a standing menace to us, and

                        <p>The fall of Atlanta, and the successes at Mobile, have produced a
                            powerful sensation in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Since the news, our government stocks have taken a sudden bound upward,
                            and the cotton loan of the rebels has had a corresponding fall.</p>
                        <p>The events are regarded as being paralleled in significance during the
                            war only by the capture of New Orleans.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen</hi>: It is with extreme gratitude to
                                Divine Providence that, in opening the present legislative session,
                                I am able to announce to you that the condition of the country may
                                be considered generally satisfactory.</p>
                            <p>Our relations with foreign powers continue on the most favorable
                                footing.</p>
                            <p>The land and naval forces of the mother country, and in our colonial
                                possessions, continue to afford me reason for satisfaction.</p>
                            <p>Although the condition of our East India possessions is in many
                                respects satisfactory, I deeply regret that a violent epidemic has
                                committed ravages in Java, and it is my most ardent desire to hear
                                soon that this malady has ceased to afflict that colony.</p>
                            <p>The results of the emancipation of the slaves in our West India
                                colonies are not unfavorable, if compared with those which an
                                analogous measure has entailed elsewhere.</p>
                            <p>The administrative regulations of the government of the colonies of
                                Surinam and Curaçoa will be again submitted to you for
                                deliberation.</p>
                            <p>I shall have recourse to your assistance in the establishment of the
                                tariffs of import and export duties, and of transit dues, to be
                                introduced in the Netherland Indies, and to regulate various
                                questions affecting industrial and agricultural enterprises
                                there.</p>
                            <p>Great developments are taking place in public works. The corps of the
                                engineers of roads and bridges fulfils, with laudable zeal, duties
                                which have of late acquired great extension. A revision of this
                                important branch of administration, to conform to existing
                                exigencies, has been prepared.</p>
                            <p>The construction of the State railway is being regularly continued.
                                The returns from those portions open to traffic exceed previous
                                calculations. Conventions for the connexion of our railways with
                                foreign lines have been concluded with the neighboring states. New
                                concessions will give the Netherland network of railways an
                                extension which will require fresh labors upon the roads and at the
                                maritime ports.</p>
                            <p>I observe with much satisfaction that the execution of the law for
                                middle-class education is everywhere received with lively interest
                                and frank co-operation.</p>
                            <p>The results of the harvest have proved better than was at one time
                                expected. The returns from the deep-sea, river, and coast fisheries
                                have been good; but many lives have unfortunately fallen victims to
                                storms.</p>
                            <p>Our trade continues in active development.</p>
                            <p>Although the state of war in which several countries are engaged may
                                have exercised an unfavorable influence upon commerce, it is
                                satisfactory to observe that ship-building is on the increase among
                                us.</p>
                            <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0345"/>
                            <p>Bills regulating medical supervision, the commercial guards, and
                                military quarters, will be again laid before you.</p>
                            <p>The bill for the code of examination in criminal cases, which is
                                intended to replace the code now in operation, will also be
                                submitted to you for deliberation.</p>
                            <p>The state of our finances will allow of provision being made for the
                                requirements of the public service, and for continuing the
                                redemption of the public debt.</p>
                            <p>Bills for the complete suppression of the city toils, and for other
                                undertakings of a financial character, will be laid before you
                                during the present session, as well as bills regulating the method
                                of keeping the accounts of the national finances.</p>
                            <p>May the important labors to which the present session summons us
                                tend, under God’s blessing, to the great prosperity of the
                                country.</p>
                            <p>I declare the ordinary session of the States-General open.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>Since the taking of Atlanta by General Sherman, there has been a marked
                            change in the public sentiment of Europe in regard to our affairs.
                            Previous to that period the conviction had become general that the last
                            strongholds of the rebellion, Richmond, Charleston, and Atlanta, were
                            strong enough to defy the assaults and the strategy of the federal arms.
                            This judgment was everywhere ostentatiously promulgated.</p>
                        <p>The unexpected fall of Atlanta suddenly destroyed the illusion, and the
                            public judgment on the whole subject fell to pieces. Since then it has
                            little by little been centering itself on another and quite opposite
                            view, which the recent accounts of the campaign of General Sheridan in
                            the Shenandoah valley tend strongly to confirm. This is, that the
                            greatly preponderating weight of the loyal States is at length under
                            skilful generalship, and that the rebellion is too much exhausted to
                            withstand it. The favorite form of doubt about the success of the
                            government now is, that, while it is admitted to be probable its armies
                            will overrun and occupy the seceding States, insuperable difficulties to
                            their pacification will still be found.</p>
                        <p>This, you perceive, is a vast contraction of the line of argumentation
                            here against the prosecution of the war. It is, in fact, a retreat to a
                            position seen to be untenable by all, even by those who occupy it, since
                            it is equivalent to a denial that in war the conquered party does not
                            submit, and that we have no statesmanship to deal with results which war
                            achieves.</p>
                        <p>We have here a fresh illustration that our victories over the moral
                            hostility of Europe keep exact pace with those of our armies in the
                            field over the rebels. In war we know that argumentation becomes of
                            small account, whether at home or abroad. The sword settles all.
                            Especially is it the only thing which will settle the stilted
                            penny-a-lining with which our cause has been assailed in Europe ever
                            since the beginning of our struggle. Every time our generals defeat a
                            column of the enemy at home, they annihilate many columns of the same
                            enemy over here.</p>
                        <p>The general aspects of the European world are peaceable. Elements of
                            disturbance there are as usual, but they are less numerous than common.
                            The Danish question, the Roman question, and the Polish question, all of
                            which have been so long threatening the public peace, are disposed of on
                            terms that are accepted by the leading powers, if not satisfactory to
                            them; and thus the present danger of war in Europe from these causes has
                            disappeared.</p>
                        <p>The commercial world is undergoing a violent shock, attended with much
                            disaster and many apprehensions. The cotton question, after slumbering
                            for a year or two, reappears to aid the disturbance, of which it did
                            much to lay the foundation. The fall in its price has demolished many
                            fortunes erected on its rise. This, acting with the collapse of
                            extensive commercial and industrial speculations of every possible
                            nature, fomented by the establishment of an extraordinary number of
                            joint-stock companies, invading every branch of trade and industry, has
                            thrown mercantile and financial affairs into a confusion, of which the
                            issues are not yet clearly perceived.</p>
                        <p>The great abundance of the resources of commerce, now capable of such
                            rapid concentration, and the full and still rapidly increasing supply of
                            the precious metals, may be expected, however, to aid powerfully in the
                            rapid restoration of affairs to a healthy condition. Money, though
                            exceptionally high in price, was <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0347"
                            />never so plentiful, and financial disaster, therefore, under these new
                            conditions. cannot soon again be so sharp or so long continued as when
                            the supply was restricted to a half of what it now is. The same
                            consideration promotes, also, a cheerful view of our own national
                            finances.</p>
                        <p>The mercantile rate of interest in Europe is now hardly less than nine
                            percent., while our government bonds still command an almost unlimited
                            supply of capital at about twelve per cent. If the loyal States would
                            close up their political divisions, and unitedly put their shoulders to
                            the wheel to crush the evidently tottering rebellion, we could probably
                            borrow what money we want to borrow in Europe as cheap, under a
                            judicious administration of our finances, as the merchants get it. The
                            distrust occasioned by these divisions costs us the difference we are
                            now paying.</p>

                            servant,</p>

                            relation to the enlistment of Poles for the insurgent military service.
                            I place little reliance on the report, though it has appeared some time

                            the desire to organize a fleet <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0349"
                            />which may at need defend their coast, there is found in the front rank
                            that of the construction of iron-clads. The government of his Majesty
                            would attach much importance to a knowledge of the results which the
                            naval authorities of the United States have obtained in this matter, and
                            the construction finally which the government of the United States,
                            enlightened by experience, judges to be preferable for this class of
                            vessels.</p>
                        <p>If I do not deceive myself, the two American monitors, Mahopac and
                            Dictator, which have lately been launched, both represent, the last in a
                            larger scale than the first, the system which appears to be of the
                            latest adoption. It is only the great obligingness of the government of
                            the United States, and your extreme kindness, sir, which give me hope
                            not to hazard in vain the respectful application to obtain some
                            information that will enable me to give the royal government the
                            advantage of the experience so gloriously obtained here, and I shall be
                            very happy if your kind intromission should enable me to obtain the
                            plans on which these steamers were constructed, as well as the data
                            which give exactly their dimensions, the mode of armament, their
                            equipment, interior arrangement, and the machinery which serves to
                            manœuvre them. * *</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The government of the King has just
                            instructed me to submit to the most serious consideration of the
                            government of the United States the grave causes of complaints which
                            have been given at the port of New York to a large number of captains of
                            merchant vessels and to several Netherland ship-owners.</p>
                        <p>There has been forwarded to me a document, drawn up and signed at New
                            York, on the 21st of July last, by L. Van Geelkerke, captain of the ship
                            Delft; G. G. Leori, captain of the ship Samhiri; B. J. Fergast, captain
                            of the ship Nederwaard; H. A. Harms, captain of the ship Elizabeth; J.
                            de Veer, captain of the ship Christina Maria; A de Boer, captain of the
                            ship Elizabeth; K. Blonpot, captain of the Syne Jacobs; H. W. Koetse,
                            captain of the Fennechicna; D. Van Amerongen, captain of the Catharina
                            Maria; J. Klein, of the Picterdina; J. Snock, of the Wilhelmina, all
                            declaring to have been put to great difficulty in consequence of the
                            desertion of their seamen, who, from their arrival in the waters of the
                            United States, were tampered with, on hoard even of their own vessels,
                            by numerous kidnappers, who rushed on board of them without any respect
                            for the foreign flag or the authority of the captain; tempting the
                            seamen by bounties and high wages; seducing or stupefying them with
                            intoxicating liquors; menacing the captains with violence should they
                            land, and frequently with the revolvers which they held in their hands.
                            They there represented and exercised a system of barbarity which
                            certainly would not be tolerated by the government of the United States.
                            On several occasions, when the captain, in order to prevent desertion,
                            had caused the chests of the seamen to be placed in his cabin, the
                            kidnappers took them away by force; and when our consul general
                            addressed himself to the American authorities, he was unable to obtain
                            any efficacious suppression.</p>
                        <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0350"/>
                        <p>On one occasion it was answered him that the captain only had to cause
                            himself to be respected; that he only needed to blow out the brains of
                            whomsoever against his consent should come on board his vessel, and
                            should there commit acts of violence. The government of the United
                            States would doubtless regret, as much as myself, similar extreme
                            measures. I am convinced that it shares my opinion, that they should be
                            avoided; that in every civilized country the just and lawful suppression
                            of kidnapping and violence must be exercised by the authorities of the
                            country, and should not be abandoned to the individuals themselves.</p>
                        <p>The ship-owners of Rotterdam, Woogerand, Weldervank, and Veedam, Messrs.
                            Rouche &amp; Co., W. G. Ledebver, Yan Overgee, H. &amp; S. Kroner, De
                            Boer, and Vander Goot, who addressed themselves by petition to the
                            minister for foreign affairs, declare that unless there be an energetic
                            suppression thereof on the part of the authorities of the United States,
                            the commerce of the Netherlands should cease with New York; and they
                            insist upon it, with the government of the King, that, in the unexpected
                            event of a refusal of justice, the vessels of the United States shall
                            not be admitted to enjoy, in the ports of the Netherlands, the rights
                            and advantages which the vessels (commerce) of the Netherlands should
                            find refused to them in American ports.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that it will only be necessary to bring these grave abuses
                            to your knowledge, sir, in order that the just government of the United
                            States may induce the competent authorities to protect our merchant
                            vessels against any future invasion from the tamperers and kidnappers,
                            and cause all those who should board them, in spite of the captain, to
                            be severely punished; to cause those to be dealt with agreeably to the
                            full rigor of the laws who shall bring about the desertion of our
                            seamen, a crime in itself quite as reprehensible as the invitation to
                            desert the American flag, and which no government would be willing to
                            cover with its protection.</p>
                        <p>According to our treaty of commerce and navigation with the United
                            States, concluded at Washington on the 19th of January, 1839, article
                            third, we have the right to ask for our consuls (as we accord it with us
                            to the consuls of the United States) “protection and assistance as may
                            be usual and necessary for the duly exercising of their functions, in
                            respect also of the deserters from the vessels (whether public or
                            private) of their countries.”</p>
                        <p>Hence our captains complain that, far from finding protection and
                            assistance in the port of New York, desertion is there tolerated, if not
                            favored; that in order to have deserters arrested and imprisoned, they
                            have to incur such high expenses that ordinarily they prefer to desist
                            from their pursuit. This inconvenience is indeed grave, but it has been
                            borne with patience. It may be that foreigners have not the right to
                            expect a gratuitous interposition from the police to recover and keep
                            seamen deserting. But what does seem undoubted is, that our captains
                            must be shielded from the invasion of their vessels by tamperers and
                            kidnappers, who come to induce desertion, and lend to it violence—main
                            force.</p>
                        <p>I flatter myself, sir, that this unpleasant reclamation will be met by
                            the government of the United States, and particularly by you, Mr.
                            Secretary of State, whose obliging and just spirit towards foreigners is
                            known and appreciated, with all the consideration which the grave facts
                            which have rendered it necessary deserve; and that I shall soon be
                            enabled, through your kindness, to communicate to the government of the
                            King the measures which will be adopted to protect our vessels, reassure
                            our captains and ship-owners, and render possible the continuation of
                            our ancient commerce, and peaceful navigation with the United
                            States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 15th instant, calling my attention to
                            certain complaints which have been made by a number of Netherland
                            ship-owners and captains of merchant vessels, relative to outrages
                            alleged to have been committed upon the crews of these vessels in the
                            port of New York. In reply I have the honor to state, that the
                            transactions thus complained of are entirely new to this government.
                            With regard to what has already transpired, it appears that the
                            statement makes no mention of persons, dates, or other circumstances
                            necessary to enable this government to institute judicial examination;
                            if you will favor us with them, the attention of the proper officers
                            will be directed towards bringing the offenders to punishment. On the
                            other hand, in the event of a recurrence of proceedings of the character
                            above referred to, it becomes the duty of the legal officers and
                            magistrates to prevent aggressions, and protect strangers engaged in
                            lawful commerce. In doing this they are entitled to the co-operation of
                            revenue officers; and also, in this case, of military and naval
                            authorities who are engaged in recruiting. I beg to assure you that all
                            needful instructions will be given to these classes of officers to
                            prevent a recurrence of the evils of which you complain.</p>
                        <p>Accept, sir, a renewed assurance of my high consideration.</p>

                            the 15th, relative to complaints which many of our captains and owners
                            have made to the royal government on the conduct of the kidnappers and
                            crimps who came on board their vessels in the port of New York. I will

                            ulterior instructions from him, I now make it my duty to thank you for
                            the promptitude with which you have met my inquiry, and lent your good
                            offices to the end that efficient measures may, in future, guarantee our

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I had the pleasure, in despatch No. 52, to
                            inform you in relation to the translation of Wheaton. I have now the
                            honor to inform you that the Chinese government have employed our
                            countryman Raphael Pumpelly, of Owego, N.Y., to make a scientific
                            exploration of the country near Peking, with particular reference to the
                            discovery and development of coal mines. Mr. Pumpelly has completed his
                            engagement with the Japanese government of a like nature, and was on his
                            way home, via Mongolia and Russia. It occurred to me to make an effort
                            in the interests of science, on his behalf, with the Chinese
                            government.</p>
                        <p>I found, in a conversation with Sir Frederick Bruce, the British
                            minister, that he would have an interview with Wansiang the day
                            following our conversation. Fortunately, the idea had entered Sir
                            Frederick’s mind, and he was but too happy to aid me in getting Mr.
                            Pumpelly in. He mentioned it to Wansiang, who immediately called upon me
                            and had an interview with Mr. Pumpelly. I subsequently accompanied Mr.
                            Pumpelly to the foreign office, where the whole affair was arranged. Sir
                            Frederick kindly permitted Mr. Murray, a most accomplished young
                            gentleman and government student, to accompany Mr. Pumpelly as
                            interpreter. They set out in company, with and under the protection of
                            military and civil mandarins, with letters to the officials in the
                            interior. I learn by letters that everywhere they have met with kindness
                            from the people. Thus Mr. Pumpelly has the singular satisfaction of
                            being the first man employed by the Chinese government to carry the
                            light of his branch of science into the hitherto unexplored mines of
                            China. He is well fitted for the enterprise. He is young, modest, and
                            capable. He was most thoroughly educated in Germany, after which he
                            explored the silver mines of Arizona, and then, upon the recommendation
                            of the eminent geologist, Mr. Whitney, of California, was appointed to
                            make a survey of the island of Yedo, in Japan.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The accompanying enclosures relate to a
                            proposition on the part of the Chinese government to modify Art. XIV of
                            the American treaty, which they think bears hardly on our citizens in
                            some of its applications; and I have the honor to bring the subject to
                            your notice, with one or two remarks.</p>
                        <p>It grew out of a complaint made to this government by its officers at
                            Shanghai, (enclosure A,) that it was a common practice of American
                            shipmasters to present false manifests of their cargoes, and that the
                            consuls were unable or <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0353"
                            />unwilling to remedy it. I replied to this allegation, (enclosure B,)
                            that it was necessary to state particulars; but deemed it pertinent to
                            their despatch to mention the judgment given in two cases of violations
                            of regulations, in order to show them that our consuls did what they
                            could to maintain the laws over American citizens.</p>
                        <p>To this Prince Kung replied (enclosure C) with a suggestion to modify the
                            XIVth article of the American treaty, so as to conform the penalty for
                            presenting false manifests to that laid down in the British treaty. His
                            reasoning seemed to me just, and the proposal indicated more
                            thoughtfulness than I had looked for, and a desire to harmonize the
                            diversities found in the treaties. I accordingly agreed to the
                            suggestion (enclosure D) until a reference could be made to the
                            government at Washington, and have already issued a notice to the
                            consuls to this effect, (enclosure E.)</p>
                        <p>I submit the question for your consideration, with the respectful request
                            that instructions may be furnished me, so that I may inform the Chinese
                            officials.</p>

                            <p>“I have been informed by the intendent of circuit at Shanghai that
                                Mr. Macpherson, acting collector at that port, has written to him,
                                stating that it is the common practice of masters of American ships
                                at that port to present false manifests of cargo, nor will the
                                United States consul pay any attention to this fraudulent conduct of
                                the shipmasters. If they continue to act thus, measures should be
                                taken to deal strictly with them in order to put a stop to this loss
                                and injury, and I request you to inform the United States consul,
                                that he may attend to the matter.</p>
                            <p>“The intendent thereupon wrote to Mr. Consul Seward respecting it,
                                who replied, ‘the presentation of false manifests is a great evil,
                                and is practiced to some extent, but until I have reported the
                                question to the United States minister at Peking I cannot levy any
                                fines.’ I accordingly refer the whole subject to the foreign office
                                for instructions how to act in such cases.”</p>
                            <p>On receiving the above despatch I examined the treaty, and find that
                                the XIVth article provides: “That any citizen of the United States
                                who shall trade in any contraband article of merchandise shall be
                                subject to be dealt with by the Chinese government, without being
                                entitled to any countenance or protection from that of the United
                                States.” The XXIst article further stipulates: “That if the
                                superintendent of customs, on examination, shall detect any fraud on
                                the revenue in the case, then the goods shall be subject to
                                forfeiture and confiscation to the Chinese government.”</p>
                            <p>Now, it is both a fraud and a loss of revenue to present a false
                                manifest; and as the consul knew that the detriment was great he
                                ought to have aided the collector and carried out treaty
                                stipulations, and by inflicting the punishment to have deterred
                                others from like practices. Moreover, his excuse that he could <pb
                                    n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0354"/>not punish the delinquent
                                because he had not yet reported the matter to the United States
                                minister was an evasion of duty far from an honorable and
                                straightforward course.</p>
                            <p>In addition to sending this despatch to your excellency and orders to
                                Li, the superintendent of commerce, that he may inquire into the
                                matter and settle it, I likewise request that you will enjoin on all
                                the American consuls that whenever a case of presenting false
                                manifests comes before them they will strictly carry out the full
                                stipulations of article XIV of the treaty about clandestine trade,
                                and also of article XXI respecting frauds on the revenue.</p>
                            <p>It is to this end that I write, and in the hope of receiving a
                                reply.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                despatch of your imperial highness of September 22, in which you
                                inform me of the practice of masters of American ships presenting
                                false manifests, and that the consuls would not interfere to remedy
                                the evil, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>As this despatch indicates no names, nor specifies the dates or kind
                                of property, I have no data on which to instruct the consuls to act,
                                nor have I heard before of this practice of rendering false
                                manifests. But in respect to the suggestion to enjoin United States
                                consuls to observe treaty stipulations I beg to enclose a copy of a
                                correspondence with the consul at Shanghai respecting a case of
                                infringing the Tangtsze regulations, from which you will perceive
                                the desire on our part to strictly enforce the rules.</p>
                            <p>In August last he wrote as follows: “The firm of Frazar &amp; Co. had
                                bought two native boats which were sent up the Yangtsze river with
                                cargo to the open ports, but at the end of the three months, which
                                the regulations require as the limit at which the shipping permit is
                                to be returned, they did not present the one for these boats, but
                                said that if required they could bring evidence that the goods had
                                entered the customs.</p>
                            <p>“The firm of Leighton &amp; Co. seat a vessel up the Yangtsze with
                                cargo, whose permit was in like manner not returned in time, but was
                                handed in at the Shanghai custom-house after the three months. Now,
                                both of these were cases of infringement of the regulations, though
                                one returned the permit and the other did not. They have stated
                                their cases to me, and, so far as I can see, the one overpassed the
                                time and the other lost the permit; they were not engaged in
                                smuggling, and might be released from the fine.</p>
                            <p>“The customs officers said the merchants were not smuggling, but
                                still had broken the regulations, and should be fined fifty taels
                                each for their offence instead of five hundred. This was reported to
                                me and I confirmed the decision, but it appears that the two firms
                                resist this judgment, and refuse to pay the fine because they had
                                not been smuggling. The customs officers maintained, however, that
                                this infraction of the regulations caused them much inconvenience; I
                                have, therefore, deemed it best to report the two cases for your
                                decision, for this violation of the regulations and refusal to pay
                                the fines are against all order.”</p>
                            <p>On receiving this report and perceiving that the conduct of the two
                                firms, in <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0355"/>refusing to pay
                                the mitigated fine of the customs officers, indicated great
                                disregard of the Yangtsze regulations, I immediately directed the
                                consul at Shanghai to adjudicate the cases according to the strict
                                letter of the regulations, and levy the fines as therein stated.
                                From this statement your imperial highness will perceive that the
                                United States consuls are zealous in carrying out all the
                                regulations respecting the trade on the Yangtsze river.</p>
                            <p>As to what is said in the despatch under reply about rendering false
                                manifests, and the indifference of the consuls about attending to
                                the matter, you will perceive from this that all the officers of the
                                United States regard the treaty as of the highest importance. There
                                is not, therefore, at present any need of enjoining this matter upon
                                them, as they already know their duties and desire to fulfil
                                them.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                                sends a communication.</p>
                            <p>On the 2d instant I received your excellency’s reply to my previous
                                despatch respecting the common practice of American merchants
                                presenting false manifests, and my request that instructions might
                                be sent to the United States consuls to carry out the provisions of
                                the XIVth article of the treaty respecting smuggling, in which you
                                say that as no names are mentioned, or the time or sort of goods
                                indicated, there are no data to act on, and it is difficult to send
                                specific orders to remedy it. In this reply a letter from the consul
                                is copied, and particulars are given respecting the violation by the
                                firms of Frazar &amp; Co. and Leighton &amp; Co. of the limit
                                allowed for returning a permit, and of the fine imposed on them, all
                                of which I fully understand.</p>
                            <p>I have ascertained that the injurious practice of rendering false
                                manifests is not confined to one port or one nation. If an English
                                ship does it her master is fined five hundred taels, according to
                                the XXXVIIth article of the English treaty; but if the offender be
                                an American the provisions of article XIV of his treaty must apply
                                to the case, and the Chinese officers be allowed to deal with it
                                without his being entitled to any protection from the officers of
                                the United States. Therefore, in all such cases, when the offender
                                is an American, the penalty is not one of a fine at all, and yet it
                                is an offence deserving of punishment. If, however, it is only
                                lightly fined, it will be dealt with differently from what the
                                English treaty requires, and the merchants of the two nations will
                                not then be treated alike. Furthermore, the laws of China are
                                strict, and if an American merchant merely smuggles, and no other
                                crime is involved in the act, there is no mode of arriving at an
                                equitable decision in the case, while the penalty [of his own
                                treaty] seems to be too severe.</p>
                            <p>While I desire to observe all the provisions of the treaty most
                                carefully, I still think that a more equitable law respecting this
                                matter might be settled, so that the American merchants be not fined
                                too heavily, and it is for this purpose that I now address another
                                communication to your excellency upon this matter.</p>
                            <p>I propose the question for you to consider, when tie American
                                merchants present false manifests of cargo they shall be punished
                                according to article XIV of their own treaty, and be dealt with by
                                the Chinese officers alone, or be fined five hundred taels,
                                according to the provision of the English treaty, and <pb n="336"
                                    xml:id="pg_336" facs="0356"/>thus all parties be placed upon the
                                same footing. I hope that you will examine this proposal and decide
                                on the point, so that orders may be sent to the several consuls
                                directing them how to act in such cases.</p>
                            <p>As to the cases of Messrs. Frazar &amp; Co. and H. Leighton &amp;
                                Co., let them be punished by fine, according to the Yangtsze
                                regulations, as their vessels and property may have been valued.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of
                                your imperial highness’s despatch of the 16th instant, in which you
                                remark that the presentation of false manifests is not confined to
                                any nation, nor to any one of the ports. If an Englishman is
                                convicted of this offence, the thirty-seventh article of the British
                                treaty provides that it be punished by a fine; but in case of an
                                American committing it, his treaty brings it under article fourteen,
                                wherein it is stipulated that all such cases shall be punished by
                                the Chinese government, &amp;c. It appears, therefore, that offences
                                of this description are decided by a different rule from the
                                English; and I wish to express my thanks for the thoughtfulness
                                herein exhibited in that, while desirous of carefully observing all
                                treaty stipulations, you still think that a more equitable rule can
                                be made whereby American merchants shall not be mulcted more heavily
                                than others. It is clearly the most equitable mode of disposing of
                                such cases.</p>
                            <p>The consuls of the United States in China will, therefore, for the
                                present, decide all cases of presenting false manifests of cargo in
                                conformity to the provisions of article thirty-seven of the British
                                treaty; but in respect to adopting this as a permanent modification
                                of the fourteenth article of the United States treaty, it will be
                                necessary first to represent the circumstances and argument of your
                                present despatch upon the subject to the government at Washington.
                                When I have received a reply I will communicate further upon the
                                matter.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to forward to you several
                            documents relating to the wrecks of American vessels on this coast and
                            my action thereon; they would have been sent sooner had I not expected
                            some definite information respecting the loss of the Kien-wan.</p>
                        <p>The first (enclosure A) is my reply to Charles Kelson, giving my reasons
                            for declining to bring his claim for indemnity for his losses to the
                            notice of the Chinese government. He estimated his personal losses at
                            $2,622, but nothing has yet been presented to me on account of the ship
                            and cargo by the owners or underwriters.</p>
                        <p>The second (enclosure B) is a similar answer addressed to O. B. Bradford,
                            esq., the United States vice-consul at Amoy, giving my reasons for not
                            presenting the claim of Frank J. Luders for losses sustained by him and
                            others to the amount of $18,000 by the wreck of the brig Askanderia on
                            Formosa. These two letters contain the principal facts about both these
                            wrecks, so that I do not send more; and I refer to them as containing my
                            reasons for not demanding indemnity of this government for losses
                            sustained thereby, and I hope you will approve the grounds for so doing.
                            The subject is a difficult one to settle satisfactorily, but the conduct
                            of the Chinese officers on occasions of wrecks is in general humane.
                            Wrecks are frequent along this coast, and some of them are attended with
                            much suffering. In most cases the lives of the unfortunate crews are
                            safe, even if their vessels and cargoes are plundered, however, and the
                            ruthless wreckers themselves are restrained from killing the men by a
                            fear of condign punishment.</p>
                        <p>I am informed that when the thirteenth article of the American treaty was
                            under discussion, the Chinese negotiators were desirous to learn the
                            usages in. western countries respecting wrecks, and refused to modify it
                            so as to take the responsibility for the lawlessness of their subjects
                            towards shipwrecked people. I am desirous to learn the views of the
                            government on this question, and, in order not to hamper it in any way,
                            I refrained from all reference to a claim in my note to the Chinese
                            government. (Enclosure C D.)</p>
                        <p>The other two papers (enclosures E F) show that the treatment of
                            castaways in other parts of the coast is sometimes in marked contrast to
                            the experience of Captain Nelson, and I am told that such instances of
                            kind treatment are not un common. I have not yet learned the proper name
                            of the Kien-wan, (for the Chinese characters do not convey the true
                            sound,) but as soon as the details of the wreck come to hand I will
                            inform you, for I think the case a very good one (if the facts turn out
                            to be true) for special approbation and reward on the part of the United
                            States government. If I could obtain the insertion of a notice in the
                            Peking Gazette that the prefect of Fah-chan had been allowed to receive
                            a present for this kindness to American citizens, the effect might be
                            encouraging to other officials in similar cases. Whenever native vessels
                            are <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0358"/>wrecked, the shore people
                            usually pounce upon them and take the hull and cargo as their lawful
                            property, and the crews seldom try to defend their vessels.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I did not receive your favor of
                                December 26, 1862, until some time last month, after I had learned
                                the loss of your ship and the sufferings experienced by yourself and
                                Mrs. Nelson and the crew, through Sir Frederick Bruce, her Britannic
                                Majesty’s plenipotentiary. The circumstances attending the loss of
                                the Lucky Star were most distressing, more so than has usually been
                                the case among the unhappy casualties along that part of the coast
                                of Formosa, and I desire to tender yourself and Mrs. Nelson my
                                sincere sympathies with your misfortunes. It was a relief to learn
                                that no lives were lost through the cruel treatment of those
                                barbarous natives; and I have already conveyed my thanks to Mr.
                                Braune, her Britannic Majesty’s acting consul at Tanshwai, and to
                                Baron Meritens, for their active kindness in rescuing you all.</p>
                            <p>The claim which you have made upon the Chinese government through me
                                for indemnity for personal losses can be pressed upon it only under
                                the provisions of article thirteen of the treaty relating to
                                shipwrecks. The account that you have sent me does not show that any
                                application was made to the Chinese authorities in that part of the
                                island to relieve the crew or save the cargo, though it is likely
                                that nothing they could have done would have rescued the latter from
                                their lawless subjects. If you will read that article you will
                                perceive that a plain distinction is made between the acts of
                                officials and the violence of their subjects, the responsibility of
                                the imperial government being limited to the former. In all the
                                treaties lately made with it, the complicity of its own agents in
                                such cases forms the ground for a claim of indemnity. In the present
                                case a demand for compensation for loss of the ship and cargo (which
                                would of course be regarded as identical with your own) would be
                                decided adversely on the same grounds; and, in this view of the
                                case, I may add, incidentally, that I am supported by the British
                                minister.</p>
                            <p>It is well known that the Chinese authorities are often unable to
                                restrain their subjects along their coasts, though their own
                                intentions might be most friendly. The pirates and wreckers that now
                                infest many parts will, I hope, gradually be restrained, and during
                                the last twenty years much has been done to put them down, but the
                                provisions of our treaty are clear with regard to the liability of
                                the Chinese rulers.</p>
                            <p>Under these circumstances, therefore, I am constrained to decline to
                                prefer your claim for indemnity. I shall, however, bring the
                                incidents of the wreck to the notice of the authorities, with a
                                request that orders be sent to the local magistrates of Tanshwin to
                                exert themselves more vigorously in relieving shipwrecked crews
                                thrown on their coasts. I am, respectfully, yours,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to acknowledge your favor of the
                                13th ultimo, informing me of the confirmation of your appointment of
                                vice-consul at Amoy, and congratulate you on this evidence of the
                                approval of the government.</p>
                            <p>I have re-examined all the papers relating to the claim of Frank J.
                                Luders, late master of the brig Iskanderia, for indemnity for losses
                                sustained in the wreck, including the reply of the Chinese officers
                                to Mr. Hyatt, on his demand for the payment of some rice and money
                                alleged to have been obtained from or on account of the wreck; and
                                the result leads me to the conclusion that we have not sufficient
                                grounds in the premises for making a demand upon the Chinese
                                government for indemnity.</p>
                            <p>From the evidence it appears that the prefect of Taiwan did send some
                                soldiers and others to the assistance of the sufferers as soon as
                                application was made, though perhaps too late to be of any real
                                service; but by doing so he came within the letter of the treaty in
                                respect to furnishing assistance, while, by his offer of $200 to the
                                captain, he further showed his willingness to aid the crew in
                                reaching home. It would be idle to suppose that any large portion of
                                a cargo of rice would remain to be salved, after even two or three
                                days, under the circumstances, and I do not think the local
                                authorities can be held responsible for this condition of
                                things.</p>
                            <p>In order to establish a claim for indemnity, the complicity of the
                                Chinese officers in robbing a wrecked vessel is to be proved, and in
                                this case the opposite was the fact; the only complaint made against
                                them being that their power was weak, and their aid useless against
                                the violence of the natives. The ferocity and insubordination of the
                                inhabitants of that part of China is a well-known trouble to the
                                rulers, and their weakness may gradually be strengthened, so that
                                better government may arise; but this state of things is excepted in
                                the treaties, and the power of the local officers to afford relief
                                to needy foreigners must be estimated by their general ability to
                                manage their own subjects.</p>
                            <p>I am compelled, therefore, on a careful review of this case, to
                                conclude that the claim for losses in the wreck of the Iskanderia
                                does not come within the meaning of article XIII of the treaty, and
                                constitute a valid claim on the Chinese government, and you can
                                inform the applicants to this effect.</p>
                            <p>I shall, however, bring the circumstances to the notice of the high
                                authorities, with a request that orders may be sent to the officials
                                in Taiwan to exert themselves actively in rescuing such American
                                vessels as may unfortunately be lost on Formosa.</p>
                            <p>I am yours, respectfully,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The United States consul at Amoy has
                                informed me that the American ship Iskanderia was lost on Formosa,
                                December 27, 1861, on her way from Taiwan to Amoy, at a place called
                                Pu-tai-tsin, in the district of Kia-i, distant <pb n="340"
                                    xml:id="pg_340" facs="0360"/>about ten miles from the city of
                                Taiwan. The ship was half imbedded in the sand when the villagers
                                robbed her of everything, but did not wound the crew. The captain
                                reported the wreck to the prefect of Taiwan, and besought protection
                                and help; but he moved so tardily, that before any officials reached
                                the spot the villagers had carried off everything, to the loss of
                                more than $20,000.</p>
                            <p>I have also learned that the American ship Lucky Star, on her passage
                                from Shanghai to Hong-Kong, went ashore on Formosa, last November,
                                between Tanshwin and Kilung. When she was seen, more than two
                                thousand natives arrived with knives and spears, assembled on the
                                beach to watch her, and when the captain with his wife and son
                                reached the shore with a boat’s crew, they were all robbed of their
                                clothes, the female of her ornaments, and thus stripped, carried
                                several miles into the interior and held for a ransom of a thousand
                                dollars. The other sailors made their way to Tanshwai, and reported
                                these proceedings to the officers, who declined to act on the
                                instant. The foreigners there learning the state of the case,
                                collected a party of men, and went to the place to bring away all
                                the party, but they found that the ship and her cargo of cotton,
                                valued at $80,000, had been entirely plundered.</p>
                            <p>I have learned the truth of these reports, and bring the
                                circumstances of these two wrecks to the notice of your Imperial
                                Highness, in connexion with the provisions of the XIIIth article of
                                the United States treaty, which stipulates that when a vessel is
                                wrecked, the local Chinese officers shall, on learning the case,
                                afford all the protection and aid possible, and not permit the
                                natives to injure and rob her. The coasts of Formosa are exceedingly
                                dangerous to navigators, and it would appear from these two cases
                                that the local authorities there have either no power to restrain
                                the people, or are too dilatory and negligent to do it; and I,
                                therefore, avail myself of the occasion to request that particular
                                orders may be sent to the proper officers on Formosa to exert
                                themselves to afford all the protection to shipwrecked persons and
                                property they are able. It might be proper, too, to inform the
                                natives generally, through their head man, that when they assist in
                                saving persons and property from wrecked vessels, a portion of what
                                is saved will be given to the salvors, as is the usage in western
                                countries, according to the toil and danger incurred in protecting
                                it.</p>

                            <p>I have the honor to acknowledge the despatch of the 28th ultimo, in
                                which your excellency informs me that “in December, 1861, the
                                American ship Iskanderia, on her voyage from Taiwan to Amoy, was
                                driven ashore by a storm at Pu-tai-tsin, in the district of Kia-i,
                                where she was stranded; that when the case was reported to the
                                authorities of Taiwan city, they were so dilatory in affording
                                relief that the villagers on the spot had already completely
                                plundered the vessel.</p>
                            <p>“Also, in another instance, that the ship Lucky Star, on her voyage
                                from Shanghai to Hong-Kong, was driven ashore near Ki-lung, in
                                Formosa, and broken up; that the wife and son [of the captain] were
                                seized by the natives and plundered, and afterwards held for ransom,
                                while others of the crew reported the circumstances to the
                                authorities at Tanshwin; but they, also, would <pb n="341"

                                help, and the whole of the cargo of cotton and the wreck were
                                carried off by the natives. You, therefore, request that orders may
                                be given to the local authorities of those places to exert
                                themselves, and afford aid and protection in such emergencies.”</p>
                            <p>It is well understood that whenever foreign vessels are wrecked or
                                driven ashore [upon our coasts] by tempests, or [their crews] suffer
                                injury or robbery at the hands of natives, that the officers at the
                                place, on hearing the facts of the case, shall do all in their power
                                immediately to save and relieve the sufferers; but in the
                                above-mentioned cases the authorities at Taiwan and Tanshwin failed
                                to exert themselves when the masters of the two vessels reported
                                their losses. However, neither of these instances having been
                                kitherto reported to the foreign office by the officials of Fukien
                                province, the statement now received from your excellency shall be
                                copied for transmission to the governor general of the province,
                                directing him to make inquiry, and report upon the same; and,
                                moreover, specially to enjoin on the authorities along those coasts
                                to exert themselves, in all cases of wrecks, to save and succor the
                                sufferers, as far as lies in their power. And to this end I now
                                reply.</p>

                            <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, herewith
                                sends a communication.</p>
                            <p>I received a despatch on the 4th instant from the general in command
                                at Mukten, enclosing a report from the military magistrate at
                                Fuh-chan, <note n="*" xml:id="d394fn1">Fuh-chan is a small district
                                    town lying on the east side of Gulf Liatung, latitude 39° 40′,
                                    longitude 121° 43′.</note> to the following effect:</p>
                            <p>“On the 24th of September the American ship Kien-wan, on her passage
                                along the coast near the mouth of the Han-kia river, was driven by a
                                tempest on the ledges and wrecked. A linguist (or comprador) came
                                and reported the disaster at this office, and begged that two junks
                                might be hired to take off the cargo, and carry it to Yingtsi, at
                                the same time handing in a despatch from Mr. Knight, the United
                                States consul there. Soldiers and policemen were accordingly
                                detailed to go to the spot and carefully guard the property; and
                                seeing that the vessel was fast on the rocks, I had the cargo taken
                                ashore and stored in a fish warehouse hired for the purpose. This
                                place (<hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> Fuh-chan) lies along the
                                sea-side, however, has no harbor or shipping, nor is there any
                                regular price for hiring boats.</p>
                            <p>“After this there came in another despatch of the linguist,
                                requesting that four policemen might be retained in charge of the
                                property, and a large junk be immediately hired to proceed to the
                                spot to be in readiness for use at the ship, as a small one would
                                not serve. I accordingly despatched a messenger post haste to
                                Niang-Niang to hire a junk; and lest the merchants should become
                                impatient, I wrote to inform them that Fuh-chan was a very small
                                incommodious place, and really furnished no large junks that could
                                be hired.</p>
                            <p>“Shortly afterwards the consul sent for nine Americans to go to
                                Yingtsi to get a junk. So I engaged three carts for them, and
                                detailed a gens d’armes to accompany them. On the 27th the captain
                                of the ship went off to the reefs, and set fire to the vessel, which
                                was entirely burned: He also urgently pressed <pb n="342"
                                    xml:id="pg_342" facs="0362"/>the hiring of a vessel; and on the
                                30th three junks arrived from Niang-Niang, with the messengers. He
                                immediately put aboard all the goods which were stored on shore into
                                two of the junks, all in good order, nothing being lost or left, and
                                sailed the same day for Tingtsi, full of joy and grateful for the
                                accommodation.”</p>
                            <p>It is the rule that whenever a foreign vessel is disabled or wrecked
                                within Chinese territory, the local authorities at the place shall,
                                on being informed thereof, devise means to assist the crew and save
                                the cargo. Now, in this instance of the ship Kien-wan, lost on the
                                shoals near Han-kia river, within the jurisdiction of the magistrate
                                of Fuh-chau, it appears that the latter, on receiving the despatch
                                of Mr. Consul Knight, forthwith sent policemen to the spot to look
                                after things, hired a house to store the goods in, and, seeing no
                                junks could be engaged there, despatched men to go to Niang-Niang to
                                procure three, into which the cargo was laden without loss or
                                injury. It may justly be said that the officers at Fuh-chau have
                                exerted themselves in every way to afford their help and
                                protection.</p>
                            <p>In the despatch [from Mukten] there is a sentence, however,
                                respecting the <hi rend="italic">linguist’s despatch,</hi> which
                                needs to be noticed, for it is contrary to the treaty; and if the
                                linguist did himself write an official communication, (as if he were
                                a consul,) such presumption should be reprimanded and the practice
                                stopped. If it is not, I am afraid that when another instance like
                                the present occurs, the local officers will be offended at its
                                impropriety, and refuse to receive the document, whereby detriment
                                may perhaps result to the distressed seamen. I have accordingly
                                notified the general in command at Mukten to send a copy of the
                                linguist’s despatch for the information of the consul, that he may
                                reprove the man.</p>
                            <p>I also inform your excellency of these occurrences that a notice may
                                be sent to merchant captains, that if they meet with disasters along
                                the coast, where a consul’s help cannot be obtained, they had better
                                resort to the magistrate’s office, state their case, and ask for
                                assistance; but by no means get the linguist to write a
                                communication in the name of the consul.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you of the
                            settlement of the most difficul question that has arisen since my
                            arrival in China. You have doubtless heard much of the building in
                            England of war steamers for the Emperor of China, and finally of the
                            sailing of the “Osborn Flotilla.” But unless you were more fortunate
                            than I was, you did not learn the exact terms on which this fleet was to
                            be made available, or on what precise service it was to be employed.
                            When I entered into the co-operative policy with my colleagues, as
                            recounted in my despatch No. 42, it was understood that the steamers
                            were to put down piracy, and aid in maintaining the revenue laws. On the
                            condition that the force was to act in this sense, and that the service
                            was to be cosmopolitan, no special objection was made to it by the
                            ministers of France, Russia, and the United States. I disclosed a little
                            suspicion, in my despatch, it is true, but immediately qualified it by
                            the confidence I expressed in the wisdom and fairness of the British
                            minister, Sir Frederick Bruce. When I saw, in the English newspapers,
                            strange accounts of the number of war steamers which were said to be
                            building for China, I felt it to be my duty to make inquiries of the
                            Chinese government in relation to them. I did so, and gave you the
                            result in my brief despatch, No. 51, but I could not then learn the
                            names of the vessels, nor of their armament, for the Chinese had not
                            been informed upon these subjects. About five months since Mr. Lay,
                            inspector general of customs, came to Peking to secure a ratification of
                            certain agreements he had made in relation to the steamers. He did not,
                            as far as I know, make known his purposes to the ministers. We only
                            gathered them from two cleverly written papers in “Blackwood,” of
                            February, 1863, in which Mr. Lay’s merits are fully set forth, as by one
                            intimately acquainted with them, and expectations were raised of what
                            might result from his rare qualities, in the way of civilizing China.
                            These papers were so full of hope and good intentions, that, though we,
                            at Peking, felt that the author was under a misapprehension as to
                            affairs in China, still we could but wish Mr. Lay success. His
                            discussions with the Chinese ran through the greater part of four months
                            without any realization of his hopes. In the mean time Captain Sherard
                            Osborn arrived with his fleet, ready for service. We soon learned that
                            there was a “hitch,” owing, it was said, to the “stupidity arid bad
                            faith of the Chinese.” Not knowing then all the questions involved, I
                            believe I may say, with truth, that there was a general feeling against
                            the Chinese. * * *</p>
                        <p>The Chinese government refused to ratify the agreements, and the papers
                            were then placed in the hands of Sir Frederick Bruce, and the nature of
                            the agreements, for the first time, came fully to his knowledge, and to
                            the knowledge of his colleagues; and that you may better understand
                            them, I will give briefly their history. For a long time past the
                            ministers have suggested to the government, that for police purposes,
                            and in aid of the revenue laws, a few small steamers <pb n="344"
                                xml:id="pg_344" facs="0364"/>would be serviceable. These views were
                            also held by the European employés in the customs. With some vague
                            understanding in relation to steamers, Mr. Lay, inspector of customs,
                            who went to England, primarily for his health, undertook to get them,
                            but finding that he could do little without authority, he prepared a
                            letter of instructions, which he sent out, to be adopted by Prince Kung.
                            Mr. Hart, a very able man, who was acting in the place of Mr. Lay, had
                            been permitted, at the request of Sir Frederick Bruce, to come to Peking
                            to consult about regulations for trade in the Yang-tsze-kiang. While
                            here, the letter arrived from Mr. Lay. Mr. Hart, by his intelligence and
                            modest manners, had won, and deservedly so, the entire confidence of the
                            Chinese, and, favoring the steamer project, he had no difficulty in
                            securing their assent to the general letter of instructions which Prince
                            Kung sent to Mr. Lay, coupled with the suggestions of Mr. Hart, which
                            might serve to indicate the number of the steamers and the nature of
                            their service, when they should arrive. Mr. Lay says he never received
                            the letter. This letter was simply a general letter of instructions to
                            buy, equip, and man certain steamers and bring them to Shanghai, and to
                            make such agreements as were necessary to this end. Under this letter he
                            entered into articles of agreement with Captain Sherard Osborn, and a
                            large number of officers and men of her Majesty’s navy, by which the
                            captain, officers, and men were to serve four years; that the captain
                            was not only to command the ships purchased, but all others manned by
                            Europeans in China; that all moneys for the payment of the force should
                            go through the hands of Mr. Lay; that all orders were to pass through
                            him, and if he thought any order unreasonable, he could veto it. Such is
                            the substance of the material articles. When they were communicated to
                            the Chinese government, it indignantly refused to ratify them, on the
                            ground that it would be a practical abdication of the sovereignty of the
                            empire. At this point, as I have before stated, the papers were placed
                            in the hands of Sir Frederick Bruce, and the question arose as to what
                            was to be done with the ships. Three dangers menaced them, upon the
                            dissolution and departure of the force: the Daimios in Japan, seeking
                            war steamers; the lawless men on the coast, into whose hands they might
                            fall, to be used for piracy; and the confederates, who have agents in
                            China. I earnestly protested against their being left in that situation.
                            Sir Frederick Bruce, in a spirit of that large amity which he has never
                            failed to recognize, at once relieved my apprehensions by stating that
                            the ships should be sent with the men to England, and that the whole
                            question would be submitted to his government. He gave this information
                            to the Chinese government. It was all that was left for him to do. At
                            this stage in the history of the affair the Chinese came to me, in a
                            great state of alarm, and earnestly asked my advice. I said my advice
                            would be predicated upon their answer to one question: Would they, under
                            any circumstances, ratify the agreements between Lay and Osborn? They
                            replied that under no circumstances would they assent to the agreements.
                            I then advised them, 1st, to give their reasons fully for not ratifying
                            the offensive articles of agreement; 2d, to thank the British government
                            and Captain Osborn for what they had done for them; and 3d, that
                            inasmuch as there was a misunderstanding between them and their agent,
                            which could not be reconciled, they should request the British minister
                            to have the flotilla returned to England, under the direction of Captain
                            Osborn, the ships sold, the men paid off and discharged, and the
                            proceeds remitted to them. They followed this advice to the letter, and
                            addressed a handsome letter to Sir Frederick Bruce to this effect, and,
                            without suggestion from any one, added, as a compliment to Captain
                            Osborn, that they would be pleased if he would accept ten thousand
                            taels. Thus was settled, after weeks of anxious discussion, continued
                            for the last three days at the United States legation, almost without
                            intermission, this question involving so many interests. The virtue of
                            the plan is, that it settles the question here, safely, to the
                            satisfaction of all parties, and relieves everybody from all fear of
                            future complications on <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0365"/>account
                            of the flotilla. The truth is the fleet was out of proportion to the
                            needs of the Chinese, and quite beyond anything over dreamed of by us in
                            Peking. One of the vessels, I am told, is the fastest war vessel in the
                            world; and all the ships are equipped in a manner, it is claimed,
                            superior to anything of equal size afloat. But the flotilla had fair
                            play, and the failure cannot be charged to the jealousy of anybody.
                            When. the several articles of agreement became known to me, I confess
                            that I was surprised; and if the Chinese had not rejected them at once,
                            without suggestions from any one, I should have been constrained, by a
                            sense of justice to the Chinese, and in the interests of my own country,
                            to have opposed them. To the credit of the British government, I learn
                            from Mr. Lay that it was not aware of the articles of agreement between
                            Captain Osborn and himself. The British government may also rejoice that
                            it had at Peking, a representative so enlightened and just that he would
                            not, by menace, undertake to force an arrangement which no one could
                            defend, and which would have at once shaken our confidence in that
                            co-operative policy which he had done so much to establish. He, by his
                            prudence, relieved his government from a complication that no man could
                            see the end of. Captain Osborn, as soon as he saw the real situation, to
                            his honor be it said, determined at once not to involve himself or his
                            government. He saw that the Chinese could not meet the only conditions
                            upon which a British officer could with honor serve in China. By the
                            constitution of the government, one must hold his commission at the will
                            of a local governor, and must be subject to his orders. It is not in the
                            power of the imperial government to depart from this rule; and this was
                            the real difficulty. Had Captain Osborn thought more of his pecuniary
                            interests, and less of his own and his country’s honor, he would have
                            taken the command on the Chinese conditions—have made an attack upon
                            Nanking, won a temporary notoriety, and left his country involved in a
                            mortal struggle with the rebels, and subject to the taunts of the
                            civilized world. For his noble course I do hope he may be appreciated at
                            home, as he is here, not only by the representatives of foreign
                            governments, but by the Chinese themselves. They had come to believe
                            that every foreigner could be had for money, upon any terms. One man has
                            illustrated the higher quality of western civilization, and that man is
                            Captain Sherard Osborn. For the humble part I have taken in this affair,
                            in which I have assailed no one, but tried to do right, I am pleased to
                            inform you that I have received the thanks of the British, French, and
                            Russian representatives, and the kind letter from Prince Kung, which I
                            enclose, marked A. Hoping that my conduct may receive the approval of my
                            own government, I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>At 8 o’clock yesterday morning we received the translation in Chinese
                                sent us by Mr. Williams. The matter of which it treats and that
                                which we discussed the day before so fully with your excellency,
                                viz., the manner of sending back the money received by the sale of
                                the flotilla, has all been arranged; and we have likewise reported
                                the whole to Prince Kung, who has adopted the plan.</p>
                            <p>Seeing that Admiral Osborn has had so great trouble in bringing these
                                ships to China, and will have more in taking them back to England so
                                long a distance, <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0366"/>we have
                                donated him the sum of ten thousand taels, which is to be deducted
                                from the money received from their sale, in order to exhibit the
                                high regard in which he is held by the Chinese government. We shall
                                be obliged if you will, also, convey him our thanks.</p>
                            <p>The reply which we were to send to the British minister has already
                                been handed in to him, and we will take a leisure day to prepare a
                                copy of it to enclose for your information, and also to tender to
                                you our thanks in person. We send this note now, with the expression

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my despatch No. 16 I indicated the
                            purposes to which I thought the surplus fund in China should be applied.
                            In your reply, No. 15, you stated that my views would be transmitted to
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>I now beg leave to submit a few remarks of a practical nature in aid of
                            the suggestions then made; and if the money is expended in the direction
                            which I have recommended, it will result in an institution of learning
                            for the benefit of the United States and China. This institution I would
                            name the American College, or Ta-Mei Kwoh Hioh-kung. It should be placed
                            at Peking, partly for sanitary reasons, but chiefly because this city is
                            the political and literary centre of the empire, and where the court
                            dialect is easily acquired. Thousands of students visit it every year to
                            compete for the prizes of the empire, and anything so unique as an
                            American college, with the happy circumstances under which this would be
                            founded, could not fail to attract general attention.</p>
                        <p>Its objects should be two-fold: 1st, to teach Americans the language and
                            literature of China, so as to fit them to be interpreters and consuls;
                            and 2d, to educate clever Chinese in English studies and in their own
                            literature, with a view to their employment by either their own rulers
                            or by the United States. In respect to the education of interpreters, it
                            seems hardly worth while to dwell at any length in this despatch, so
                            frequently have our needs in this respect been set forth. Suffice it to
                            say, that there are now fourteen ports open to trade by treaty, at eight
                            of which we have consuls, and interpreters at three. The English, whose
                            trade alone exceeds ours, have consuls and interpreters at all of them,
                            and at the larger ports have an interpreter and two assistants; and,
                            moreover, nearly every English consul speaks this language, having been
                            promoted from the staff of interpreters. The Foreign Office in London
                            now sends the young men intended for interpreters to Peking, to be
                            educated under the direction of a gentleman selected for that purpose.
                            They are primarily selected from the graduates of home colleges, after a
                            severe competitive examination, and remain in the service of government
                            during good behavior at an annual stipend of $1,000, to be increased as
                            they are advanced to higher grades and to consulships. Ten of these
                            students came to China when I did, two years ago, and <pb n="347"
                                xml:id="pg_347" facs="0367"/>under these advantages have made
                            remarkable progress, one or two of them taking high rank as scholars in
                            Chinese. As they become fitted for service, they are distributed among
                            the consulates, where from their character and acquirements, they at
                            once have great and deserved influence. I cannot too warmly commend the
                            competitive system recently adopted in England. It is republican, and is
                            filling the British civil service throughout the east with persons of
                            the rarest ability and most elevated character. If we would conserve our
                            interests and illustrate our institutions in these regions, surely we
                            must rouse ourselves from the lethargy of the slavery regime, and offer
                            to our youth an opportunity to win those prizes in the world which
                            belong to the good and intelligent. To this end I would establish, at
                            the very centre of this ancient civilization, the institution I now
                            propose; and that it may at once become useful, I would respectfully
                            recommend that the President be authorized to appoint, after a severe
                            competitive examination, ten young men above the age of 18 years, who
                            are to be sent to the American college at Peking as student
                            interpreters, at a rate of pay not exceeding $1,000 per annum. This
                            salary can be increased as they are advanced to be interpreters and
                            consuls. They should be entitled to remain during good behavior, and the
                            government at Washington should have the first claim to their services,
                            though liberty might be granted them to accept other service when
                            expedient.</p>
                        <p>The act of Congress approved August 18, 1856, section seven, was intended
                            to provide for a class of consular pupils, as above recommended, but for
                            some reason it was subsequently repealed, and I earnestly recommend its
                            re-enactment, with such modifications as may be thought wise. Those
                            students who are appointed by the government with salaries should, of
                            course, bear their own expenses, and be no further charge to the college
                            than for rooms and tuition. As there are so many fields open in China to
                            those who can speak its language, it might be well not to limit the
                            access to this institution to those Americans who are to be permanently
                            employed by the government, for it appears to me that other young men,
                            knowing that rooms and tuition were free, would like to avail themselves
                            of its advantages. Mercantile firms and missionary societies might also
                            desire to place students at it for limited periods, for in one year, I
                            am almost sure, a young man of studious habits might here fit himself
                            for a useful or lucrative employment in China, and in two years become
                            equal to any requirements that might be reasonably demanded of him.</p>
                        <p>To render the institution still more useful, I recommend that a limited
                            number of natives be received as students, who shall be taught and
                            boarded out of its funds, none for a longer term than six years. I think
                            there will be no difficulty in selecting promising young men who have
                            already made progress in their own language, as many as may be desired.
                            I hope, from my present relations with the Chinese officials, to be
                            encouraged by them as they learn our design; even now they permit
                            missionaries to instruct youths in their employ, and are likely to
                            regard a well-endowed institution with favor. Nor will they be
                            altogether indifferent to the spirit of equity which gives this
                            direction to a sum of money that originally came from them.</p>
                        <p>For the organization of the college, I respectfully suggest that $200,000
                            be set apart as the permanent fund, and this amount sever to be
                            encroached upon, but the whole placed at the highest rate of interest
                            compatible with its safety, the interest alone to be used for the
                            preliminary and current expenses, such as purchase and repair of
                            buildings, salaries, tuition, &amp;c. The college to be under the
                            direction of a board of ten trustees, all resident in China, to consist
                            of the United States minister and secretary of legation, the United
                            States consul at Shanghai and at Tientsin, <hi rend="italic">ex
                                officio,</hi> three leading merchants and three missionaries; the
                            merchants to have the chief management of the funds. To aid you in the
                            immediate selection of the latter, I would suggest that the merchants be
                                <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0368"/>the heads of the houses of
                            Russell &amp; Co., A. Heard &amp; Co., and Olyphant &amp; Co., and the
                            missionaries be the Et. Rev. W. J. Boone, D. D., of Shanghai, Rev. Henry
                            Blodget, of Tientsin, and W. A. P. Martin, D. D., of Peking. The faculty
                            may consist of the principal and his assistants, the former chosen by
                            the trustees, with power to select his assistants, subject to their
                            approval.</p>
                        <p>The college is to have no sectarian character, but religious services
                            should be required, such as the reading of the Sacred Scriptures daily,
                            the observance of the Sabbath, &amp;c. The trustees residing at Peking
                            should act as a board of visitors. An annual report of the progress and
                            condition of the college should be made to the government through the
                            Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>I have now suggested the name and place for this institution, stated its
                            objects, and sketched a brief plan for its organization. Permit me,
                            lastly, as warmly as I may, to urge speedy action upon it. The plan is
                            not extravagant; indeed, it may seem too narrow for so large a fund; but
                            I wish to secure the safety of the money and propose moderate results at
                            first. You know what noble endowments have been wasted in extravagant
                            buildings and large salaries, and these ought to be avoided in China. I
                            invoke your personal interest in this subject; it will be a congenial
                            one, worthy of you, and if our hopes shall be realized, and an American
                            college established at Peking, it will reflect lasting honor upon our
                            beloved country.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As a sequel to the flotilla affair, I have
                            now to inform you of the dismissal of Mr. Lay from the service of the
                            Chinese government. It occurred in this way: After the departure of
                            Captain Osborn the Chinese came to me and said that they had lost
                            confidence in Mr. Lay; that he had not only required that the flotilla
                            should be placed in his hands, but that he should have entire control of
                            the customs revenue; that he had been impertinent to them; that he had
                            demanded to be put on a level with the chief officers of the government;
                            that he had requested that large sums of money should be given him, so
                            that at Peking he might maintain more than imperial state; that he had
                            requested a foo to live in, against the customs of the empire, as none
                            but members of the royal family are permitted to reside in these. These
                            and more complaints were made against him. They requested me to advise
                            them, under the circumstances, what to do. I told them, as Mr. Lay was
                            not a countryman of mine, that it was a delicate subject for me to
                            interfere in, but that I thought it was a matter exclusively their own.
                            They intimated that they intended to dismiss him in any event. I finally
                            agreed to consult with my colleagues and let them know the result. I did
                            so, and found them unanimously of the opinion that it was the right and
                            duty of the Chinese government to decide for itself the question, and
                            that such decision should be no ground of complaint against it. I
                            communicated this view to the Chinese, at which they expressed great
                            satisfaction. At another interview at the United States legation Sir
                            Frederick Bruce, the British minister, heard, as I had done before,
                            their complaints against Mr. Lay, and of their determination to dismiss
                            him. Our efforts were then directed in such a way as to do them and Mr.
                            Lay the least injury. They doubled his <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349"
                                facs="0369"/>already enormous salary for a few months, gave him a
                            breakfast and a large pecuniary present (6,000 taels) at. parting. After
                            what had happened, we felt it to be our duty to urge upon them the
                            expediency of not permitting the inspector of customs, or any other
                            foreign employé whose business was on the coast, to reside at Peking in
                            a <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> diplomatic capacity. In this view they
                            most heartily concurred, and immediately appointed Robert Hart, esq., in
                            the place of Mr. Lay, with instructions to reside at Shanghai. Mr. Hart
                            had deservedly their confidence. For two years past he has acted in the
                            place of Mr. Lay, and by his tact and ability had. won the regards of
                            every one. Our countrymen were particularly well pleased with him. I
                            therefore felt no hesitation in commending him warmly to their
                            favor.</p>
                        <p>Prince Kung and suite came in person to thank me for the service I had
                            rendered them by such practical suggestions as, from my cordial
                            relations with all parties, I had been able to make.</p>

                            receipt of your despatch No. 32, covering circular No. 39. I need not
                            inform you how great was my gratification at reading the circular. There
                            could not be a more lucid history of our victorious period. Our
                            diplomatic circle was charmed with it, and exulted with me in the hopes
                            it awakened. The glorious news of Gettysburg, Vicksburg, and Port Hudson
                            reached us by the way of Russia, and it would have given you pleasure to
                            have seen how warmly I was congratulated upon if by every member of the

                            my despatch No. 56, in which I called your attention to the noble
                            conduct of Sir Frederick Bruce, the British minister, in relation to the
                            flotilla. I now send a letter of thanks as addressed by me to him, to
                            which I beg leave respectfully to call your attention.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: When the Chinese government refused to
                                rectify the doings of Mr. Lay, and there was nothing left for
                                Captain Osborn but to dissolve the force of the flotilla, the
                                question was, how it could be done with safety. I feared that the
                                ships might fall into the hands of the confederates, who were
                                supposed to have agents in China; and then there was the common
                                apprehension from lawless men on the coast, in the interests of the
                                Taepings, as well as from pirates, and the desire of the Daimios in
                                Japan to procure steamers at any price. It was clear that the <pb
                                    n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0370"/>Chinese could do nothing of
                                themselves with the steamers, and that unless something were done
                                they would certainly fall a prey to one of these several dangers. In
                                my solicitude on account of the rebels in my own country, I made an
                                earnest protest against the delivery of the ships to the Chinese.
                                You responded in that spirit of comity which has ever distinguished
                                our relations, that the ships should be taken back to England, and
                                that no effort on your part should be spared to prevent them from
                                taking a direction against the interests of my country.</p>
                            <p>Though subsequent events made it necessary for the ships to take the
                                direction indicated by the desire of the Chinese themselves, still I
                                should be wanting in appreciation of your conduct did I not mark it
                                with my most heartfelt thanks, and at as early a period as possible
                                bring it to the attention of my government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that Thomas
                            Walsh, esq., an American merchant, agreed with the Japanese government
                            to sell and deliver to it certain guns which were at Macao. To carry out
                            this agreement he chartered the steamer Scotland, and despatched her to
                            Macao, where the sea was so rough that she could not take in the guns;
                            whereupon, under the advice of the pilot, the captain of the Scotland
                            took her to Cum-Sing-Moon, a place under Chinese jurisdiction, about
                            nine miles from Macao, where he commenced taking in cargo from that
                            place, with the assent of the Portuguese governor. While thus engaged
                            the British gunboat Scout appeared, and while the United States flag was
                            flying, fired across the bows of the steamer’s cargo boats; after which
                            her officers searched them and then boarded and searched the Scotland
                            herself, but, finding nothing to warrant the search, they departed.</p>
                        <p>After this, according to Mr. Walsh, these officers informed the Chinese
                            authorities that the Scotland was at Cum-Sing-Moon, whereupon they
                            despatched officers who seized and took her to Whampoa, at which place
                            she was detained under the surveillance of two British war vessels.</p>
                        <p>With these facts before him, our consul at Canton, Mr. Perry, promptly
                            demanded the release of the steamer and cargo, which demand was refused,
                            on the ground, chiefly, that the Scotland had violated the 14th article
                            of the treaty in relation to clandestine trade, and also for the reason,
                            privately given, that such release would offend the English. The above
                            facts I learned from the letter of Mr. Walsh, which, with its
                            enclosures, I herewith send, marked A. Immediately on the receipt of the
                            letter from Mr. Walsh, I brought the facts to the attention of Sir
                            Frederick Bruce, the British minister, and freely commented upon them,
                            but to his credit let me write that there was no necessity for debate as
                            to the impropriety of the conduct of her Majesty’s officers. He admitted
                            it as fully and as indignantly as I asserted it, and he marvelled, as I
                            did, that they should have presumed to search the vessel at all; but
                            much more so, that they should have done it in neutral waters, thus
                            committing a double offence against international law.</p>
                        <p>To relieve his government from the odium of such conduct, Sir Frederick
                                <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0371"/>sent the British
                            interpreter, Mr. Brown, with the United States interpreter, Dr.
                            Williams, to make known his views to the Chinese, and to support my
                            application for the release of the steamer and cargo. I addressed the
                            letter marked B to Prince Kung, by agreement, after a discussion at the
                            Foreign Office, which might serve as a memorandum of the facts, and
                            immediately received a letter from him, addressed to the governor
                            general at Canton, instructing him to release the vessel and cargo,
                            which letter was accompanied by the note from the Foreign Office, marked
                            C, signed by the principal officers of the government. in which you will
                            find the significant allusion, to the “increasing friendly relations now
                            existing between our countries.” I mark also the good will of the
                            Chinese in accepting my representation of the facts. Sir Frederick also
                            addressed a letter to the British consul at Canton, in which he most
                            pointedly condemned the conduct of the officers, and set forth his views
                            at large against their action. He addressed a despatch in the same sense
                            to his government. He also addressed a letter to me, which he requested
                            me to make known to Mr. Walsh, whom he knew personally, in which he
                            expressed a hope, that if there should be war with Japan, he would, in
                            the common interest, see to it that the guns should not fall into the
                            hands of the common enemy. That the letters might all arrive at the same
                            time, they were confided to my care by Sir Frederick, and Prince Kung
                            and I had the pleasure to forward them in two days after the receipt of
                            Mr. Walsh’s letter, by express overland to our consul, Mr. Perry, with
                            the despatch to him marked D.</p>
                        <p>The steamer and cargo are of great value, and I rejoice at their release,
                            but more especially at the manner of it. This case once more illustrates
                            the power and harmony of our co-operative policy. I particularly refer
                            to the manner in which the British minister met the questions involved.
                            I hope his government will meet them in the same spirit, and thus turn
                            that which might embitter our relations with England into the most
                            potent means of strengthening them.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Sir</hi>: I wrote you from Japan a good
                                while ago, and have since heard from others of your being happily
                                situated and honorably treated at Peking. I have not heard directly
                                from, you since your arrival there, and this may make the liberty I
                                now take appear unwarranted; but I have a vivid recollection of the
                                intimacy with which you honored me, and the regard you expressed for
                                me at Shanghai, which persuades me that your silence is not to be
                                attributed to any change of feeling. I believe, therefore, that you
                                will be glad to hear from me again. I believe, also, that you will
                                not be unwilling to render me the service which it is my present
                                object to ask. Accordingly I do not hesitate to appeal to you.</p>
                            <p>My case is this:</p>
                            <p>In September last I received an order from some Japanese officers at
                                Nagasaki to purchase at Macao certain cannon and shot, known to be
                                there, for delivery to the governor of Nagasaki, (Tycoon’s officer.)
                                The money requisite having been paid, I undertook the business, and
                                in October bought the guns at Macao, and engaged the steamer
                                Scotland to take them up to Nagasaki.</p>
                            <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0372"/>
                            <p>On the 22d of October the Scotland, being then American property,
                                cleared at Hong-Kong for Nagasaki. She had already some merchandise
                                on board for that port, as will appear by copy of her manifest
                                herewith, (No. 7.) She first proceeded, however, to Macao, there to
                                receive the guns.</p>
                            <p>On the 23d of October she arrived off Macao, but, on getting a pilot
                                on board, it was found there was not sufficient water in the bar to
                                allow a ship of her draught (17 feet) to enter either the inner
                                harbor or the Tipa anchorage; and as the stevedores declared that
                                heavy guns could not be safely transhipped from the lighters in the
                                outer roads, where a rough sea prevails at this season, it was
                                determined, on their suggestion, to take the ship and lighters to
                                the anchorage of Cum-Sing-Moon, a place about 18 miles, from Macao,
                                which, although strictly within Chinese territory, had always been
                                regarded as “outer waters,” and, until quite recently, had been
                                freely used by foreign ships, without objection from the Chinese
                                authorities. The Scotland, therefore, proceeded to Cum-Sing-Moon on
                                the 24th, and soon afterwards commenced loading from the lighters
                                which had followed her from Macao. This she continued from day to
                                day, until the 2d of June, without receiving any intimation or
                                warning from any quarter that she had no right there, or was
                                incurring any danger.</p>
                            <p>On the 2d of June the steamer of the Canton customs authorities
                                arrived at Cum-Sing-Moon, and at once put officers on board, who
                                forbade further work, declared the ship seized for infraction of the
                                treaty, and ordered her and her three undischarged lighters to
                                Whampoa, whither she proceeded on the 5th, two of the lighters
                                containing seven guns foundering on the way, (owing to the rough sea
                                running,) and only the third with five guns arriving safely.</p>
                            <p>During all the time the ship was at Cum-Sing-Moon no attempt was made
                                to trade with any Chinese subject. The ship was not there to buy or
                                to sell, but only to receive the cargo brought from Macao in the
                                lighters, and, beyond obtaining some provisions and water from the
                                fishermen, no other business was intended or attempted.</p>
                            <p>On the 6th of November the master made his protest before the consul.
                                Mr. Perry then addressed to the hoppo a communication embodying the
                                facts of this protest, and of a letter which I had written to him,
                                and asking the release of the ship on the ground that no
                                “clandestine or fraudulent trade” had been carried on; that the
                                resort to Cum-Sing-Moon had been for <hi rend="italic">refuge</hi>
                                only, and that no violation of the treaty or rules had been
                                intended. Copies of these documents are enclosed, marked 1 and 2,
                                and I beg for them a careful perusal,</p>
                            <p>On the 13th instant the reply of the hoppo was received. I enclose
                                copy of the translation, marked No. 3.</p>
                            <p>Official copies of these documents will go to you as soon as Mr.
                                Perry can forward them; meanwhile he permits me to copy them, so
                                that no time may be lost.</p>
                            <p>These are the facts of the case, and I assure you, on my honor, that
                                I have stated them fully, frankly, and accurately, to the best of my
                                knowledge. To attest such as it is possible to attest, I enclose
                                copy of my letter of instructions to the captain when sending him
                                some men from Whampoa to bring his ship up—he had only Chinese
                                coolies on board—(No. 4;) also copy of the sea letter under which
                                she flies our flag, (No. 5,) and copy of Consul Jones’s certificate
                                as to the state of Macao roads during the period in question, (No.
                                6.)</p>
                            <p>It will be evident to you, from these documents, that no violation of
                                Chinese law or territory was intended; that no violence was used at
                                any stage of the affair; that the ship resorted to Cum-Sing-Moon in
                                good faith, and for refuge only, and that she was not engaged there
                                in smuggling, in the true sense of that word.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Williams can satisfy you as to the truth of the statements
                                respecting the shallowness of the bars of both the inner anchorages,
                                (only fourteen feet at high tides;) as to the roughness of the outer
                                roads at this season; as to the fact of <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353"
                                    facs="0373"/>Cum-Sing-Moon being the nearest suitable anchorage,
                                and as to the liberty formerly enjoyed in the use of that
                                harbor.</p>
                            <p>It has been suggested to me that the Chinese authorities would
                                probably have granted us permission to use Cum-Sing-Moon as we did.
                                It was an oversight not to ask them, but, knowing how free this
                                anchorage had been in former times, it did not occur to any one
                                interested that the ship might be interfered with there. Had this
                                danger been suggested, it might easily have been avoided at the loss
                                of a little time, by waiting at Macao for fine weather.</p>
                            <p>It seems monstrous that for an offence so slight as that which the
                                Scotland committed such a penalty should be imposed as that which
                                the hoppo demands. It is doubtful whether any western government
                                would be severe under such circumstances, and least of all would one
                                expect such strictness from the Chinese government, which has
                                heretofore not only been considerate and liberal in its dealings
                                with other foreigners in such cases, but has had occasion itself to
                                urge the observance of the spirit rather than of the mere letter of
                                the treaties. It was in reliance on such a disposition in this case,
                                and in fact on the intimation of the arresting officers that it
                                would be manifested, that the ship quietly surrendered, when it
                                would have been no difficult matter to shake off the arrest; and I
                                do not doubt that the ship would ere this have been released— indeed
                                I question if she would have been disturbed at all—but for the
                                persistent and high-handed interference and influence of the British
                                naval and civil authorities here.</p>
                            <p>The Daily Press newspaper of the 28th and 30th of October, 4th, 9th,
                                and 14 th of November, will show you whence came the animus which
                                has governed the whole affair.</p>
                            <p>In the first place, a false report was circulated as to the
                                Scotland’s doings in Japan. This attracted attention to her when she
                                came to Hong-Kong, and further falsehoods having been published
                                about her there, she was followed to Macao by her Britannic
                                Majesty’s corvette Scout, which, on the 30th of October, went to
                                Cum-Sing-Moon after her. There an officer from the Scout, without
                                showing any warrant, boarded her, asked for her papers, examined
                                them, and examined the guns, &amp;c., in the lighters nearby. This
                                officer then admitted that he had no right to stop the work, and
                                permitted it to be resumed; giving no hint, however, that it might
                                be objected to by the Chinese authorities. Meanwhile the commander
                                of the Scout had, most barbarously, fired shot at the defenceless
                                lightermen, who, taking alarm at the approach of a ship-of-war in
                                full fighting trim, with men in the tops, &amp;c., had fled toward
                                the neighboring shore, but did not (as has been asserted) attempt
                                “to run” out of the anchorage.</p>
                            <p>The Scout then proceeded, on the 31st, to Whampoa, and is generally
                                believed to have given information as to the Scotland’s doings to
                                the Chinese custom-house here, now wholly in British hands. It is
                                also said, and credited, that at the same time the captain of the
                                Scout offered to seize the Scotland for the Chinese, if they would
                                make the request. This must have been declined, for the ship came to
                                Whampoa without British aid; but the Scout now lies near her,
                                watching her, and ready, it is thought, to stop her in case of any
                                attempt at rescue. Her Britannic Majesty’s gunboat Clown also
                                remains close by, and the officers of these vessels do not conceal
                                their anxiety to have the vessel and cargo confiscated, as is
                                evident by the letters written on board the Scout, dated 31st of
                                October and 6th of November, and published in the newspapers here
                                with.</p>
                            <p>As to the acts of the Scout, I need not point out to you their
                                insulting and unjustifiable character, in whatever light the
                                anchorage of Cum-Sing-Moon is regarded. They are admitted in the
                                letter from that ship dated 31st of October, and speak for
                                themselves. But if Cum-Sing-Moon anchorage is to be considered
                                Chinese waters, under all circumstances, then the Scout’s
                                proceedings <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0374"/>are as much an
                                outrage on the dignity of China as they are on that of the United
                                States, and at all events are less excusable than anything done by
                                the Scotland.</p>
                            <p>Inconsequence of these acts of her Britannic Majesty’s naval
                                officers, the British subjects in charge of the customs here, and
                                the British officials generally, are understood to have exerted the
                                whole of their very powerful influence on the Chinese authorities to
                                prevent their making the least allowance for the peculiar
                                circumstances represented in Consul Perry’s letter, and this is
                                doubtless the reason why the hoppo treats the consul’s statements so
                                disrespectfully in his reply. * * * * *</p>
                            <p>As to the legality of my supplying arms to the Japanese government
                                there can be no question, and those in the Scotland were truly
                                destined for Nagasaki, where they could only be delivered to the
                                imperial officers, as provided by the treaty. As to the propriety of
                                my operations, I am not accountable to other men; but for your
                                satisfaction, I will declare that, after much deliberation and more
                                knowledge than most foreigners have of Japan, I am persuaded that if
                                we do not deal kindly with the Tycoon’s government, and sustain it
                                by every lawful means, we shall either find ourselves expelled from
                                Japan by a reactionary revolution, or see our commerce in that
                                country dependent for its feeble light on a shameful maintenance by
                                foreign swords, as is the case in China.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Perry has yet to try the effect of a personal interview with the
                                hoppo on the Scotland’s case, in which he will again present the
                                facts urged in excuse for her irregularity, and endeavor to show
                                that the letter of the law ought to be subordinate, not superior, to
                                its spirit and to equity; but I despair of any advantage resulting
                                from it, as it is clear that the British influence here is
                                all-powerful with the Chinese, and unfriendly to us.</p>
                            <p>I accordingly lose no time in asking your good offices in this
                                matter. To await the result of Mr. Perry’s interview would lose the
                                present steamer, and might lose the last mail of the season. I
                                think, moreover, that you are more likely to succeed in the affair
                                if you make it a personal and unofficial matter, than if you have to
                                postpone it for official documents, which might attract the
                                attention and opposition of the British customs officials; and, in
                                view of the serious injury I should innocently suffer by the
                                detention of ship and cargo, as proposed by the hoppo, I hope that
                                you will consent to waive formalities in this case, and act as early
                                as possible; for not only are the Scotland’s daily expenses heavy,
                                but I fear the Japanese will impute their disappointment to bad
                                faith on my part.</p>
                            <p>I am encouraged to hope for success through your friendly efforts, by
                                knowing that you have much influence at the capital, and that you
                                have the right to ask a generous treatment of this case, on account
                                of the good conduct of Americans generally, and of the services
                                which some of us have had occasion to render to the Chinese
                                government at various times. I believe Prince Kung will be more
                                considerate of these things, and of the extenuating circumstances of
                                the present case, than his subordinate here seems inclined to be,
                                and I have little doubt that on your application he will order the
                                release of the Scotland and her cargo. As the hoppo, in his answer,
                                quotes his orders from Peking as reasons why he cannot be lenient,
                                there seems good ground for you to proceed upon, even without
                                waiting for the official documents, though it is possible he may
                                already have reported the affair to the capital.</p>
                            <p>There is but one feeling on this subject among all the Americans
                                here—missionaries included—namely, that the Scotland ought to be
                                released, and that we shall be humiliated if we allow the Chinese,
                                under British pressure, and on such mere technical grounds, to
                                confiscate ship or cargo. I have no doubt you will share this
                                feeling; and so trusting, I commit the case to your hands, believing
                                that your sense of justice, no less than your good will, will prompt
                                you to do all you can in my behalf.</p>
                            <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0375"/>
                            <p>In conclusion, I beg of you to excuse whatever of urgency or
                                impatience you find in this letter, as well as the irregularity of
                                this mode of appeal. The circumstances are so peculiar, and every
                                hour is now of such consequence, that I trust you will find it
                                possible so to excuse me.</p>
                            <p>I need hardly say that I shall be deeply obliged by any efforts you
                                make in my favor; but you may rest assured that in such efforts you
                                will not only be obliging me, but promoting justice. * * * *</p>
                            <p>Begging the favor of an early answer, and with the best wishes for
                                your health and happiness, I remain, my dear sir, yours, truly,</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Sir</hi>: Referring you to my letter
                                    of 14th instant, which will doubtless accompany this, I beg now
                                    to inform you that the result of Mr. Perry’s interview of to-day
                                    with the Chinese authorities is that they persist in requiring
                                    the condemnation of the Scotland and her cargo.</p>
                                <p>They do not deny that there was no intention to infringe the
                                    treaty, but insist that the fourteenth article was violated by
                                    the resort to Cum-Sing-Moon, and that the fact that the vessel
                                    attempted no “clandestine or fraudulent <hi rend="italic"
                                        >trade</hi>” there is of no consequence, saying that this
                                    view is sustained by the Chinese version of the treaty, although
                                    by our version the attempt to “trade” is the essential of the
                                    offence. It seems probable that on this point the two versions
                                    slightly differ, but inasmuch as the English treaty is to be
                                    construed by the English text, (article 50,) I presume ours is
                                    to have the same advantage. I beg you, therefore, to urge this
                                    point.</p>
                                <p>The hoppo expressed his regret that we had not asked permission
                                    to resort to Cum-Sing-Moon, clearly implying that, if we had
                                    asked it, permission would have been granted. It is certainly
                                    unfortunate that this was not done, but the circumstance that
                                    the necessity for going to Cum-Sing-Moon for refuge Was not
                                    foreseen should excuse us in this respect.</p>
                                <p>Another ground taken by the hoppo was, that Macao was a Chinese
                                    port, and that the trade in munitions of war was as illegal from
                                    there as from strictly Chinese ports; but if the treaty of
                                    Portugal does not contradict him on this point, the usage
                                    respecting Macao does; for, practically, Macao has been a
                                    Portuguese possession, and under Portuguese laws alone, for some
                                    time past, and, as I have stated in my former representations,
                                    we had the governor’s permission to export these guns.</p>
                                <p>Notwithstanding these arguments, the officers (the governor
                                    general being present) expressed themselves willing to deal
                                    leniently with the matter but for the fear of the British:
                                    “For,” said they, “if England goes to war with Japan, as we have
                                    heard she is likely to do, and these guns are used against her,
                                    she will consider us responsible, and we must avoid this
                                    responsibility if we can.” In reply to this, it was suggested
                                    that if the British had any right to stop the introduction of
                                    the guns into Japan, they could do so after the ship had been
                                    released by the Chinese. But it was evident that this
                                    consideration had no weight against the fears which any
                                    resistance to British pressure excited, and that this pressure
                                    (which was several times adverted to) was the real reason why
                                    the officers felt obliged to decline to release the vessel.</p>
                                <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0376"/>
                                <p>It is probable that the final result of the correspondence will
                                    be an official reference to Peking.</p>
                                <p>But I hope you will not wait for this to present the case, and
                                    that you will see and urge that this is not a case for severity,
                                    but for the utmost leniency.</p>
                                <p>In support of my claim to such leniency I will mention that, only
                                    a few months ago, the British steamer Jamsetjee Jejee-thoy,
                                    which had been seized on her arrival here for having illegally
                                        <hi rend="italic">traded,</hi> that is, bought and sold
                                    cargo at a closed port on the west coast, was liberated on
                                    payment of a small fine. This was a far more flagrant violation
                                    of the treaty than the acts of the Scotland; but British
                                    influence was in favor of that vessel as much as it is against
                                    us. The Scotland would be likewise let off if the Chinese
                                    officers dared to consult their sense of justice. But I am in
                                    hopes that what they think impracticable here may become
                                    practicable through your powerful influence at Peking.</p>

                                    <p>The American steamer Scotland, under my command, left
                                        Hong-Kong on the 22d of October, having on board certain
                                        merchandise destined for Nagasaki, and proceeded to Macao,
                                        there to take in some guns purchased by Mr. Walsh for the
                                        Japanese. On arrival off Macao I learned that it would be
                                        unsafe to attempt to load these guns in the outer roads on
                                        account of the strong wind and rough sea, common at this
                                        season of the year, and as my ship drew too much water for
                                        the inner harbor, I was advised to seek some other
                                        anchorage, and Cum-Sing-Moon was suggested as being near by,
                                        smooth and easy of access. Accordingly, and without any idea
                                        of violating any law, I proceeded there on the 24th, and
                                        soon after commenced taking in the cargo. I continued doing
                                        so without any interruption or warning from the Chinese
                                        officers until the 2d instant, when my ship was boarded by
                                        the customs officials, and, with three loaded boats
                                        (containing 12 guns) which were alongside, was seized under
                                        a warrant exhibited to me, and stated to be from the hoppo
                                        of Canton. The ship and one boat were then brought to
                                        Whampoa.</p>
                                    <p>Now, therefore, I <hi rend="italic">protest</hi> against this
                                        seizure, and demand the release of my ship and the
                                        restoration of the cargo, for the reasons following:</p>
                                    <p>1. That I committed no intentional violation of the law; for
                                        when I was last in these waters, foreign vessels were
                                        allowed to transact business at Cum-Sing-Moon, (though it
                                        was not then, more than now, a treaty port,) and I was not
                                        aware that any change had been made in this respect. As a
                                        proof that I meant <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0377"
                                        />no wrong, the fact of my ship being found without seamen,
                                        and without any preparation for immediate departure, should
                                        itself be sufficient.</p>
                                    <p>2. Had it occurred to me that my proceedings were illegal,
                                        (which I again declare it did not,) I should have been
                                        reassured by the circumstances that on the 31st of October
                                        her Britannic Majesty’s ship Scout entered the harbor, and
                                        one of her officers boarded my ship, examined my papers,
                                        pronounced them in order, allowed the boatmen (whom his
                                        ship’s approach had frightened away, and whom she had fired
                                        at) to return and recommence work, and, on being questioned
                                        on the subject, admitted that our purpose of taking guns to
                                        Japan was a legitimate one.</p>
                                    <p>These acts of the British officers plainly indicated that
                                        they did not regard Cum-Sing-Moon anchorage as Chinese
                                        waters, and as they gave me no intimation that I was
                                        violating them, I did not imagine I was doing so.</p>
                                    <p>3. Feeling confidence in the fairness and liberality of the
                                        Chinese authorities as to the issue of this affair, and
                                        being conscious that no wrong was intended them on my part,
                                        I willingly gave the services of myself and all connected
                                        with the ship to carry out the orders under which the
                                        customs officers were acting, and without which assistance
                                        they would have been comparatively powerless to bring the
                                        ship up the river.</p>
                                    <p>4. I also declare that the only cargo I took on board while
                                        at Cum-Sing-Moon was the guns and ammunition brought from
                                        Macao; that I did not land anything there, and that my
                                        purpose was to proceed with said cargo to Japan and there
                                        deliver it.</p>

                                    <p>Before me, Oliver H. Perry, United States consul for the port
                                        of Canton, China, on the 6th day of November, 1863,
                                        personally came and appeared Charles L. Gardiner, master of

                                    <p>The consul has received a communication from the captain of
                                        the steamer Scotland, and the American Walsh, shipper by
                                        said vessel, informing the consul of the seizure, on the 2d
                                        instant, at Cum-Sing-Moon, of the steamer and three Macao
                                        lighters containing cargoes belonging to her, by the Chinese
                                        customs authorities, on the allegation that the ship was
                                        receiving on board cargo prohibited by the regulations, and
                                        brought the vessel to Whampoa, where she is now
                                        detained.</p>
                                    <p>They state that the vessel did not go to Cum-Sing-Moon to
                                        carry on there “a clandestine or fraudulent trade,” (as
                                        mentioned in article 14 of the treaty,) but to get a refuge
                                        for herself and for her small cargo boats from the strong
                                        winds and rough weather that prevailed in Macao roads; that
                                        she was too large to <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0378"
                                        />enter the inner anchorage of Macao, and that Cum-Sing-Moon
                                        was the nearest smooth anchorage of sufficient depth. She
                                        went there in good faith, and without the least intention to
                                        violate Chinese territory or the laws, or to carry on “a
                                        clandestine or fraudulent trade;” that in former days it had
                                        been customary for foreign ships to resort to Cum-Sing-Moon;
                                        and neither the captain nor Walsh was aware that such a
                                        proceeding would be regarded as an offence against the laws;
                                        that they transacted there no commerce with any one, and did
                                        not land any cargo. The fact that the ship was not armed;
                                        that she carried on her work in the open day; that she had
                                        not seamen on board, but only Chinese coolies from Hong-Kong
                                        and Macao, whom she was bound to return there, and that she
                                        did keep steam on, all prove that she was not engaged in “a
                                        fraudulent and clandestine trade;” that had any violation of
                                        the law been intended, such obvious and easy precaution
                                        against detention and seizure would not have been neglected;
                                        on the contrary, the master’s respect for the law not only
                                        prevented him making that resistance to the customs officers
                                        that he could have made, but induced him to assist them to
                                        bring the ship up at Whampoa; that if it was an error to
                                        regard Cum-Sing-Moon as open for the purposes mentioned, the
                                        error was very natural, for after the Scotland went there,
                                        the anchorage was visited by the British ship-of-war Scout,
                                        and acts were done there by her which show that her
                                        commander also regarded the place as neutral ground, like
                                        the high seas. Among these acts were the boarding of the
                                        Scotland, and the examination of her papers and cargo
                                        alongside, without any warrant from the Chinese authorities,
                                        and the firing of shot at the boatmen who had been engaged
                                        in loading her. These acts would have been quite
                                        unjustifiable if the anchorage of Cum-Sing-Moon had been
                                        regarded as Chinese waters, and the commission of them shows
                                        that they were not universally regarded as such, and that
                                        the master of the Scotland was excusable for not knowing
                                        them to be so.</p>
                                    <p>The cargo which the Scotland was taking in at Cum-Sing-Moon
                                        consisted of guns and ammunition bought at Macao for the
                                        friendly government of Japan, and intended for delivery at
                                        the port of Nagasaki, in that country. The money for these
                                        guns has been paid by the Japanese officers, and much
                                        disappointment will arise if they are detained.</p>
                                    <p>Such are the facts reported by the captain and shipper.</p>
                                    <p>There was nothing improper in the purchase and shipment of
                                        these guns; they were all shipped from Macao, from which
                                        port it is permitted to export such merchandise, and the
                                        permission of the government was duly obtained in this case.
                                        In all western countries commerce in munitions of war is
                                        lawful, when it is not to benefit an enemy; and it is well
                                        known that, at this time, the government of Japan is not at
                                        war with any other nation.</p>
                                    <p>If the guns had been bought in China, or were intended for
                                        sale in China, the Chinese authorities would have reason to
                                        detain them; but such is not the case, for it must be
                                        evident that had any smuggling been intended, the
                                        circumstances would be very different. Small boats would
                                        have been employed, not a large and well-known ship. The
                                        business would have been done at night or secretly, whereas
                                        it was done openly and in the day, both at Macao, in
                                        shipping the guns, and at Cum-Sing-Moon, in receiving them.
                                        The ship would have been prepared to defend herself, or to
                                        get quickly out of danger; whereas she was unprepared, and,
                                        on being stopped, surrendered to the authorities without
                                        resistance. Moreover, it was widely known that the guns were
                                        destined for Japan, and by the treaties with Japan the
                                        import of guns into that country is legal.</p>
                                    <p>The consul, therefore, does not think it can reasonably be
                                        insisted that the master of the Scotland, or the shipper
                                        Walsh, have been engaged in “a clandestine and fraudulent
                                        trade” within the true meaning of the 14th article of the
                                        treaty, or that, upon a fair and equitable consideration of
                                        the facts, and a fair interpretation <pb n="359"
                                            xml:id="pg_359" facs="0379"/>of rule 3 of the
                                        supplemental treaty, they have violated that rule, not
                                        having in fact imported into, or exported from, China, guns
                                        and ammunition. The worst offence with which they are
                                        chargeable is that of a technical irregularity, for which it
                                        would be unjust and ungenerous for the Chinese authorities
                                        to punish them severely.</p>
                                    <p>The consul therefore trusts that your excellency will, after
                                        a perusal of this true statement of the facts of the case,
                                        order the steamer Scotland and the guns to be released.</p>
                                    <p>The consul avails himself of this opportunity, &amp;c.,
                                        &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

                                    <p>We have received the despatch of the honorable consul, which,
                                        on opening, we found to be as follows:</p>
                                    <p>“The consul has received a communication from the captain of
                                        the steamer Scotland, and the American, Walsh, shipper by
                                        said vessel, informing the consul,” &amp;c., &amp;c.,
                                        &amp;c.</p>
                                    <p>(Here the hoppo copies the whole of the consul’s despatch of
                                        November 7, word for word, without any alteration, to the
                                        end.) He then proceeds thus:</p>
                                    <p>The above was received at our office; accordingly we have
                                        examined the several articles of the treaties with the
                                        consul’s honorable country, and find that the 14th article
                                        of the treaty of Tientsin, June 18, 1858, reads thus:</p>
                                    <p>“The citizens of the United States are permitted to frequent
                                        the ports and cities of Canton and Chauchau or Swatou, in
                                        the province of Kwang-tung,” &amp;c.</p>
                                    <p>(Here follows, in the hoppo’s despatch, the whole of the 14th
                                        article of the treaty headed, “seven open ports for American
                                        trade,” word for word, as in the edition published by S.
                                        Welles Williams, Hong-Kong, 1862.)</p>
                                    <p>The hoppo then proceeds:</p>
                                    <p>“Also, in the supplementary treaty relating to commerce, the
                                        3d regulation reads thus: ‘Import and export trade is alike
                                        prohibited in the following articles: gunpowder, shot,
                                        cannon, fowling-pieces, rifles, muskets, pistols, and all
                                        other munitions and implements of war.’”</p>
                                    <p>Now, the steamer Scotland, at the place of Cum-Sing-Moon, was
                                        clandestinely taking on board cannon. That place has never
                                        been an open port for trade; therefore she has violated the
                                        prohibitions. And on a careful examination of the 14th
                                        article of the treaty, and 3d article of the supplementary
                                        treaty, we find that her proceedings were not in agreement
                                        with them.</p>
                                    <p>The comptroller has superintendence of all places on the
                                        seaboard for collecting revenue from the trading operations.
                                        In the management of this business he is guided by the
                                        several articles of the treaty. They require that this ship,
                                        with her cargo, be inspected, seized, and applied to the
                                        public benefit, (confiscated.) Several despatches have been
                                        received by us from the imperial foreign office (at Peking,)
                                        with instructions to this effect:</p>
                                    <p>“Whereas the coasts of China are in every quarter infested
                                        with robbers and outlaws, making much disturbance:
                                        therefore, in every place, implements of war, cannon,
                                        gunpowder, and articles of that description, must be
                                        strictly <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0380"/>prohibited
                                        from clandestine importation or exportation. You are
                                        required to make strenuous efforts in the examination and
                                        seizure of such. This has been put on record.”</p>
                                    <p>This place of Cum-Sing-Moon, is open for entrance on all
                                        sides and easy of access. Consequently it is very difficult
                                        to secure against or prevent the sale of contraband goods to
                                        robbers and outlaws. The captain of the Scotland having
                                        violated the prohibitions, he surely ought not to venture to
                                        present a disrespectful or insulting statement to the
                                        consul.</p>
                                    <p>We remember that the honorable consul and ourselves have for
                                        a long time been faithful friends. Whenever business has
                                        come up demanding our attention, it has been equitably
                                        arranged in accordance with the treaty. On no account should
                                        any credit or belief be given to the statements of the
                                        captain of that vessel.</p>
                                    <p>In regard to the request that the vessel and her cargo be
                                        released, it is very difficult to grant it. There are
                                        serious hindrances in the way of so doing.</p>
                                    <p>We, therefore, trust the honorable consul will notify the
                                        captain of that vessel, and the shipper, (merchant,) that
                                        the ship Scotland, with her cannon, gunpowder, and all other
                                        articles of the ship, after passing an inspection and
                                        examination, should be, (or <hi rend="italic">will be</hi>,)
                                        in accordance with the treaty, handed over for the benefit
                                        of the government and confiscated.</p>
                                    <p>With this despatch in reply, accept our best wishes and
                                        compliments.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I received yesterday a communication
                                from T. Walsh, an American merchant, relating to the detention of
                                his steamer by the collector of customs at Canton, who had seized it
                                without cause, and detained it under a mistake, and was about to
                                confiscate it. He says that his steamer was at Macao, taking in some
                                large cannon of American manufacture, to carry them to Japan for the
                                Tycoon, according to a contract he had previously made with the
                                Japanese, and in agreement with treaty regulations. When at Macao,
                                the north wind made the sea so rough that he took her into
                                Cum-Sing-Moon to escape its violence; this spot is a small harbor
                                along the coast, about twenty-five li from Macao, and almost
                                uninhabited, so that it can be clearly seen that she did not go in
                                there for clandestine trade. While busy transshipping the guns, an
                                officer from the custom-house at Canton came on board, who declared
                                that the ship was smuggling, and thereupon seized and took her to
                                Whampoa. As soon as she anchored there, two British gunboats also
                                anchored at her sides to watch her proceedings, because the Japanese
                                and the British have had a quarrel, and the latter were afraid that
                                one of the princes of that country was buying these large American
                                guns, and wished to stop the vessel going there. The charge of
                                smuggling was, therefore, trumped up against the steamer, and
                                reported to the collector of customs at Canton. The United States
                                consul informed him of all the particulars, and demanded the
                                liberation of the vessel, but he replied that he could not do so,
                                because it appeared that she had been engaged in smuggling in the
                                outer seas. The case is, therefore, reported to you, as the minister
                                    <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0381"/>residing at Peking,
                                that you may act; the monthly expenses are very large, and she
                                cannot long remain detained in this way.</p>
                            <p>I have learned from this account of the case that this affair does
                                not really belong so entirely to China, and that the act of entering
                                Cum-Sing-Moon was not at all for the purpose of smuggling or evading
                                the duties. The owner of the ship, Mr. Walsh, is worthy of credit,
                                and an honorable merchant. The collector at Canton, having detained
                                his vessel in this manner, and seeing that the ice will soon close
                                the navigation in the Pei-ho, and no more steamers will come up, (to
                                Tientsin,) while the monthly expenses of the vessel at Whampoa will
                                be uselessly spent, I specially request that orders may be
                                despatched to the collector at Canton to examine into the matter
                                clearly, to the end that she may be liberated. I shall be obliged if
                                the despatch is sent to me, and I will instantly send it under cover
                                to the United States consul at Canton, so that no delay be
                                experienced.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: We have just received your note, and,
                                in compliance with your request, now enclose a despatch to the
                                governor general at Canton, which we shall be pleased to have you
                                send under cover to the United States consul at Canton for
                                transmission to him.</p>
                            <p>We may observe, in relation to this case, that the said merchant,
                                Walsh, in entering Cum-Sing-Moon for the purpose of transshipping
                                guns into his vessel, was really violating the stipulations of the
                                treaty respecting dealing in contraband goods, and exposed her to be
                                seized and confiscated for the illegality But as your excellency has
                                ascertained that Mr. Walsh was really putting the guns into her to
                                carry them to Japan, we have accepted your representation of the
                                case, and, in regard to the increasingly friendly relations now
                                existing between our countries, are willing that the ship should be
                                released. Yet we ought to add, that another case of similar
                                violation of treaty rules cannot again be excused under the plea of
                                a transshipment for other countries; nor will it be permissible to
                                quote this case as a precedent in hopes of being treated as
                                leniently. We therefore trust that you will inform American
                                merchants of this, and enjoin upon them the strictest observance of
                                all the requirements of the treaty With this reply, we send our
                                salutations and compliments.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As soon as I received from Mr. Walsh
                                the facts in relation to the detention of the steamer Scotland I
                                took steps to secure her release. In the first place, I called the
                                attention of Sir Frederick Bruce, the British minister, to the
                                action of her Majesty’s naval officers in searching and watching the
                                steamer, and I am happy to inform you that, with me, he considered
                                their conduct unwarrantable. He condemned it in the most pointed
                                manner, and, to relieve his government from the odium of it, he at
                                once joined me in securing the release of the steamer. He has
                                addressed a letter to his consul at Canton, in which he has stated
                                his views, and given instructions in support of them.</p>
                            <p>This honorable action on his part will do much to allay the
                                excitement which will naturally grow out of this affair.</p>
                            <p>The proceedings of her Majesty’s officers were doubly illegal. <hi
                                    rend="italic">First,</hi> in interfering with the steamer at
                                all. <hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> in doing it in neutral waters.
                                The owners of the steamer were in fault in taking her to
                                Cum-Sing-Moon without the permission of the Chinese government.
                                There was, however, no intentional or real violation of the treaty,
                                as there was no clandestine trading; but there was such a technical
                                irregularity as to justify the Chinese government in taking some
                                action against the steamer. I send you a private note from the
                                Chinese, covering a letter of instructions to the governor general
                                at Canton. From this you will learn that the steamer and cargo are
                                to be released. That the necessary papers might all arrive at the
                                same time, Sir Frederick and Prince Kung have confided their letters
                                to my care, and I forward them herewith.</p>
                            <p>Commending the prompt manner in which you have acted in this most
                                important affair,</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            in the province of Chili. This is the first report of the kind ever made

                        <p>The amount of coal now consumed by steamers on the coast is more than

                            millions of taels. By opening these mines, coal which now costs from
                            eight to twelve taels per ton might be laid down on the coast at a cost
                            of between two and three taels.</p>

                                Yang Fang, Tien-kia-chwang, and Hsia-nia-Ling, to Chai-tang. Here,
                                during a stay of six days, the mines indicated by the local
                                magistrates were examined. Leaving Chai-tang, we went to Men-tun
                                kan, following the course of the Huen-ho as far as San-kia-tien.
                                After remaining four days in the coal district of Men-tun-kan, we
                                went to Fang-shem (Shiem.) Here we stopped four days inspecting the
                                principal mines. From this point we came directly to Peking,
                                arriving on the 6th November, and having been out, in all,
                                twenty-one days. The object of the journey was:</p>
                            <p>First. To find an accessible locality which should be able to
                                furnish, at a low price, coal adapted to the use of steamers.</p>
                            <p>Second. To ascertain what improvements, if any, would be necessary to
                                aid in obtaining this supply.</p>
                            <p>The properties necessary to render a coal suitable for steamers
                                are:</p>
                            <p>“First. Capacity for raising steam quickly.</p>
                            <p>“Second. For raising it abundantly for the quantity consumed.</p>
                            <p>“Third. Freedom from dense smoke in its combustion.</p>
                            <p>“Fourth. Freedom from tendency to crumble in handling.</p>
                            <p>“Fifth. Capacity, by reason of its density, for close storage.</p>
                            <p>“Sixth. Freedom from sulphur.” <note n="*" xml:id="d400fn1">Report of

                            <p>In order to ascertain more closely how far the coals of the mines
                                visited fulfil the principal of the above requirements, I have made
                                a series of analyses of specimens from the most important mines, the
                                results of which will be found in the annexed table.</p>
                            <p>The means at my disposal did not admit of perfect accuracy, but the
                                results approximate, I think, closely to the truth.</p>

                            <p>The first line of this table gives the specific gravity of each coal,
                                that is, its weight compared with that of an equal bulk of
                                water.</p>

                                calculated the third line, indicating in pounds the quantity of
                                water heated from 32° to 212° Fahrenheit by the combustion of one
                                pound of coal.</p>
                            <p>The fourth line gives the percentage of ash left by the thoroughly
                                burned coal.</p>
                            <p>The only bituminous coal seen on the journey was that in the
                                neighborhood of Chai-tung, with the description of which I will
                                begin.</p>
                            <p>The Fuh-tau mine lies about five liwest-southwest from Chai-tang,
                                among the low hills that border the valley, and about 150 to 200
                                feet above the level of this. Trending north by east, south by west,
                                this seam clips into the mountain at an angle of about 45° to east
                                by south. Several mines have been opened in it.</p>
                            <p>The thickness of coal, which varies from eight to nine feet in the
                                Fuh-tau to thirty-five feet in the Fuh-shun mine, may be safely
                                averaged at seven to eight feet. The seam can be traced about
                                one-half a mile on the surface, when its outcrop is lost at both
                                ends of this limit under loose gravel and earth, but it undoubtedly
                                continues for a considerable distance beyond in either direction.
                                Parallel to this seam there are several others both above and below,
                                one of which, four to six feet thick, is only thirty feet distance
                                in the “hanging wall.”</p>
                            <p>The coal of the Fuh-tau seam is brilliant black, formed of
                                well-defined layers, and with an irregular to cubical fracture. It
                                ignites quickly, burning with a long flame, opening slightly in the
                                fire; it bums with little smoke, without coking and without falling
                                to pieces, leaving four per centum of gray ash. Its heating power,
                                as calculated from the assay, is very high—1 pound of coal raising
                                72 pounds of water from 32 degrees to 212 degrees by its combustion.
                                The coal from near the roof of the seam is crumbly; that near the
                                floor slaty; all the rest comes out in large firm pieces. Its
                                specific gravity is 1.31. Thin films of sulphuret of iron are
                                scattered through the coal, but not sufficiently to be injurious.
                                This fuel answers remarkably well to the above requirements, and is
                                equal to some of the best foreign steam coals.</p>
                            <p>Taking the average dip of the seam to be 45 degrees, and the mean
                                thickness 7 feet, and supposing the greatest depth on the slope
                                attainable by a vertical shaft 1,500 feet deep to be 700 yards, we
                                have for every one hundred yards of horizontal extent of the seam,
                                after deducting one-third for waste, &amp;c., nearly 1,000,000 tons
                                of saleable coal. There are several parallel seams near the Fuhtau,
                                all of which that are sufficiently thick would be workable by the
                                same machinery and the same shaft as the latter, and can probably be
                                relied upon to increase the production by fifty to one hundred per
                                centum.</p>
                            <p>Thus, supposing these seams to be workable on a horizontal extent of
                                3,000 yards, a mine working them may be expected to yield 3,000,000
                                tons (5,040,000,000 catties) from the main seam, and 1,500,000 to
                                3,000,000 tons from the parallel ones, or in all 4,500,000 to
                                6,000,000 tons of salable coal.</p>
                            <p>The mine could, and with a great demand for coal undoubtedly would,
                                be worked for double the distances assumed, both horizontally and on
                                the slope, which would quadruple the production above given.</p>
                            <p>By the present system of working, the largest amount that can be
                                obtained is but a fraction of the amount given above. At a depth of
                                about seventy yards on the slope of the seam the best means of
                                drainage known in China would be useless, and it is safe to say that
                                not more than one-fifteenth of the above quantity could be
                                mined.</p>
                            <p>According to the owner of the Fuh-tau mine, the most that he could
                                deliver would be about 850 tons yearly, or about one-third the
                                quantity used by a steamer of medium size. The two other mines on
                                the same seam can furnish each about the same amount. The price at
                                the mine is 16 tael cents for 160 catties, or $2 20 for one ton of
                                2,240 pounds.</p>
                            <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0385"/>
                            <p>The King-shun mine, about 5 li north-northwest from Chai-tang, and
                                easily accessible from that place, produces the next best bituminous
                                coal. Trending northeast-southwest, the seam varies in its dip from
                                45 degrees to 90 degrees toward northwest. The thickness of coal
                                varies from 3 to 8 feet. The extent of the seam was ascertained, but
                                there is apparently no cause of irregularity for several li in
                                either direction.</p>
                            <p>The coal is of a dull black color, with irregular flaky structure. It
                                ignites quickly, burning with a long flame, coking readily, and
                                leaves three per centum of red ash. Its heating power is high—1
                                pound raising nearly 72 pounds of water from 32 degrees to 212
                                degrees. It is mote liable to crumble than that of the Fuh-tau, and
                                also considerably less dense, its specific gravity being 1.28. It is
                                also more likely to produce “clinker,” from the greater fusibility
                                of its ash. Thus, although a good coal for making coke and for
                                metallurgical purposes, it is, from its tendency to crumble in
                                handling, and to melt together and clog the draught in burning, not
                                so suitable for use on steamers. Taking the average thickness of the
                                seam to be 6 feet, and supposing the mine to be worked to a depth of
                                500 yards on the slope, after deducting one-third for waste,
                                &amp;c., each 1,000 yards of horizontal extent would represent
                                560,000 tons of saleable coal. There are several other workable
                                seams near this which could be worked with the same machinery and
                                the same main shaft.</p>
                            <p>Near Tsing-shui, about 15 li west from Chai-tang, are several mines
                                producing bituminous coal. The seams are much broken up by dikes of
                                eruptive rock, and their extent is very uncertain. It is a brilliant
                                black coal, very clean and firm, with cubical clearage; very
                                inflammable; it melts and cakes together, burning with a long flame,
                                and leaving twelve per centum of ash. Its heating power is much less
                                than that of the last-mentioned varieties—1 pound raising only 66.4
                                pounds water from 32 degrees to 212 degrees. Specific gravity 1.38.
                                It is a fair coal for making coke, and for most uses when a long
                                flame is desirable. Nearly all of it is used in tile-glazing
                                establishments of Peking.</p>
                            <p>The only anthracite mine visited near Chai-tang was that in the
                                Ta-tsan or “great seam,” although there are several others to the
                                west and southwest of that town.</p>
                            <p>The Ta-tsan is about 15 li southwest from Chai-tang, the last half of
                                the way ascending a narrow and rocky valley till it reaches the mine
                                at an elevation of from 400 to 500 feet above Chai-tang. The mine is
                                worked on two seams separated from each other by about 8 feet of
                                rock. Trending northeast-southwest, these seams dip about 45 degrees
                                to the northwest. The upper one, from which the coal is now taken,
                                is from 23 to 35 feet thick; the lower 7 to 18 feet. About
                                six-tenths of the produce of this mine is anthracite of a superior
                                quality, coming out in large, firm pieces, formed of well-defined
                                layers with conchoidal fracture and brilliant metallic lustre. It
                                burns without flame or smoke, retaining its shape and leaving three
                                to four per cent. of gray ash. Its heating power is very high, one
                                pound of anthracite raising 76.4 pounds of water from 32 degrees to
                                212 degrees; specific gravity 1.55. Its high heating power makes it
                                well adapted to steamers, the furnaces of which are fitted for
                                burning anthracite.</p>
                            <p>Taking the mean aggregate thickness of the two seams to be only 24
                                feet, (so far as seen, the average is over 40 feet,) the amount of
                                saleable coal from every 1,000 yards of horizontal extent would be
                                nearly 4,000,000 tons. The price of this fuel at the mines is one
                                small cash per catty, or about $1 68 per ton of 2,240 pounds.</p>
                            <p>The only other mines visited were the Teh-yih at Man-tan-kua, and the
                                Ying-wo and Ta-shih-tang at Fang-shan (hien.)</p>
                            <p>The coals of the first and last mentioned of these three, though very
                                fair anthracites as regards their heating power, are, from their
                                tendency to fly to pieces in burning, not well suited for use on
                                steamers, while the soft anthracite of the Ying-wo crumbles too
                                easily and possesses too low a heating power.</p>
                            <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0386"/>
                            <p>Thus the coals best suited to the use of steamers are the “dry”
                                bituminous variety from the Fuh-tau and the anthracite of the
                                Ta-tsau. As the examination was confined to the mines indicated by
                                the local magistrates, and as there are many seams which have not
                                been mined from for a long time, it is not improbable that a more
                                close examination would discover other coals of equally good
                                qualities in the neighborhood of Chai-tang.</p>
                            <p>The consumption of coal by steamers on the coast of China is probably
                                more than 400,000 tons yearly, costing to the consumers about four
                                millions of taels. The use of steamers is increasing so rapidly that
                                there is no reason to doubt that in a few years the consumption will
                                be much greater than at present. Nearly all this fuel is brought
                                from foreign countries, a large proportion coming nearly 15,000
                                miles from England. It is indeed strange that coal mined in England
                                (where the miners’ wages are from three to four times as much as
                                that of the Chinese miners) can be carried 15,000 miles and sold in
                                Shanghai for about the same price as that paid at Taku for coal of
                                the province of Chili. It is brought also from America, Australia,
                                and Japan.</p>
                            <p>China has an extent of coal fields hardly, if at all, surpassed by
                                those of any one country in the world, and containing, at least in
                                places, fuel of the best quality. It is in the power of the Chinese
                                government, by properly developing a few mines, to place the whole
                                of this trade in the hands of the Chinese subjects, with great
                                profit to themselves and much benefit to foreigners. But the only
                                means by which this can be effected is by such improvements in the
                                manner of mining as will admit of an extensive and regular
                                production, and by the adoption of a means of cheap transport of
                                coal from the mines to the port.</p>
                            <p>As the Fuh-tau seam contains in large quantity coal of the desired
                                quality, I take it for granted that unless an equally good quality
                                be found in a more accessible locality, it will be on this, if on
                                any, that improvements will be first introduced.</p>
                            <p>On the Fuh-tau seam it is impossible, by the best means known in this
                                country, to take out more than one-fifteenth to one-thirtieth part
                                of the coal that would be available by the foreign method. The
                                Chinese miner is forced in these mountains to stop at a vertical
                                depth of from 150 to 200 feet on account of the rapidly increasing
                                water. Above this depth he can mine horizontally as far as he
                                wishes; but not being able to go deeper, he can take out only a
                                fraction of the coal in all vertical or highly inclined seams, while
                                he gets only the worst coal that the seam contains, the best being
                                that which is always under water.</p>
                            <p>In western countries the miner, having powerful machinery for pumping
                                the water from the mine, can work to a vertical depth of from 1,500
                                to 3,000 feet. The use of this machinery admits of the laying out of
                                a mine to an almost unlimited extent. By two sets of galleries in
                                the coal—the one set parallel with the direction of the seam; the
                                other following the dip, and crossing the first— the mine is laid
                                out into squares, opening up the whole field that is to be worked.
                                By this arrangement a very large surface of attack is exposed, along
                                which a great number of miners can be placed. As communication is
                                thus established with the most remote limits of the coal belonging
                                to the mine, the working is begun at these farthest points, and the
                                coal is taken out in working back toward the main shaft. Thus few or
                                no galleries require to be kept open in the old workings, where
                                expensive timbering would be needed. The greater the surface of
                                attack, the greater will be the number of mines, and the production
                                proportionably larger. The coal is brought on tramroads through the
                                galleries to the main shaft, up which it is raised by steam power.
                                Finally, all excavation in the hard rock, and often that in the
                                coal, is rapidly made by blasting. A mine on the Fuh-tau seam,
                                worked in this manner, could be made to produce 200 to 300 tons
                                daily, at a cost of less than one dollar per ton. The carrying out
                                of such an arrangement would require the engagement of a foreign
                                mining engineer, two head miners, for directing under-ground works,
                                and two <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0387"/>machinists, for the
                                engines, &amp;c. The machinery could be brought from England or
                                America. All the rest could well be done by Chinese labor, and
                                ultimately no foreign employés would be necessary.</p>
                            <p>But such improvements in the Chai-tang district would be of little
                                use without a corresponding change in the means of transport. At
                                present the price paid in Peking for Chai-tang coal is from four to
                                fire times the original cost at the mines, and delivered at Taku its
                                cost would be about the same as that of English coals at Shanghai.
                                Again, the carriage to Tang-chou, alone, of 200 to 300 tons daily
                                would require a stock of from 14,000 to 20,000 mules, as each
                                journey occupies seven days. This mode of conveyance is evidently
                                impracticable. The only suitable means of transport would be by
                                railroad. The most practicable route for such a road would, I think,
                                be Chai-tang to Tsing-peh-kau, 30 li; Tsing-peh-kau to Hsia-ma-ling
                                and Kau-kia-kau, 60 li; Kau-kia-kau to Yang-Fang and Fung-chou, 145
                                li; and were it continued from Tang-chou to Taku, 225 li— 460
                                li.</p>
                            <p>The only difficult work in building this road would be about two
                                miles of the stretch between Chai-tang and Tsing-peh-kau, about one
                                mile between this and Hsia-ma-ling, about three miles of the stretch
                                between that place and the Fuh-teh-ling, and, finally, over this low
                                ridge itself. From the Fuh-teh-ling, down the Kau-kia-kau valley, to
                                Yang-Fang, and over the plain to Tung-chou, or Taku, would be
                                excessively light work. From Chai-tang to Yang-Fang there would be
                                but one stream of any size to bridge over, and but one ridge—the
                                Fuh-teh-ling—to cross.</p>
                            <p>Such a road, and the introduction of the improvements already
                                indicated, would not fail to cause the opening of many extensive
                                mines, developing in these barren hills a great and highly
                                profitable industry.</p>
                            <p>The nation that has made such a grand system of canals to facilitate
                                internal transmits will not fail, sooner or later, to do by
                                railroads, where they are needed, that which it has so admirably
                                done for the plains by canals.</p>
                            <p>There are three ways by which such an enterprise can be carried into
                                execution: by the government opening and working the mines and
                                railroad for their own account; by encouraging the formation of a
                                company among Chinese capitalists who would undertake it; or,
                                finally, by placing it in the hands of a foreign company.</p>
                            <p>It would be well, before opening a mine at Chai-tang, to have
                                examined the coal districts of Suen-wha (fu), Yung-ping (fu), those
                                on the east side of the Gulf of Lian-ting, and those of southern
                                Hoonan.</p>
                            <p>The benefits arising from a development of the coal resources of the
                                country would be felt not only by those interested in steamers, but
                                by every class of people. Several millions of taels which now leave
                                the country to pay for imported fuel would go into the hands of
                                Chinese. The demand for labor, which would be wholly Chinese,
                                increasing in proportion to the growing development of the mines,
                                would give employment to a large number of people, for where now <hi
                                    rend="italic">one</hi> man depends for his means of living,
                                directly or indirectly, on the working of the coal mines, <hi
                                    rend="italic">more than fifty</hi> would find their support. The
                                fuel used by the people generally would be delivered to them at a
                                fraction of the price.</p>
                            <p>I have said nothing of its effects on other branches of industry.
                                This would ultimately be immeasurably great in a country possessing,
                                like this, an almost unlimited supply of labor and such varied
                                resources. It is to the development of their coal and iron industry
                                that the nations of the west owe almost wholly their great and
                                increasing commercial and military power. England, with a population
                                of about 28,000,000—nearly the same aft that of Chili—produces
                                yearly a hundred million tons of coal and nearly seventy million
                                peculs of iron. The coal mines alone employ about 220,000 miners.
                                The value of these two minerals alone, at the mouths of the mines,
                                is over $100,000,000.</p>
                            <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0388"/>
                            <p>China possesses these resources to an unlimited extent, and, with
                                these, the labor and the industry necessary to develop them.</p>
                            <p>To return to the more immediate limit of my report, the general
                                conclusions at which I arrive are—</p>
                            <p>1. That there exists in large quantity near Chai-tang bituminous coal
                                and anthracite of a quality equal to the best and superior to much
                                that is imported.</p>
                            <p>2. That by the present means of mining and transport it will never be
                                able to compete with foreign coal, owing to the small amount that
                                can be produced, the great expense of carriage, and, in consequence
                                of these, its necessarily high price at the port.</p>
                            <p>3. That the only means by which it can be made to compete with
                                imported fuel is by introducing <hi rend="italic">in full</hi> the
                                foreign method of mining, and by adopting railroad transit, at least
                                for the Chai-tang district.</p>
                            <p>4. This can be done either by the government itself or by a company
                                of Chinese or of foreign capitalists, or of both.</p>
                            <p>5. That while the present price of Chai-tang coal at Taku is from ten
                                to twelve taels per ton, (including all profit,) by the adoption of
                                the plan a general outline of which I have presented, fuel could be
                                delivered at Taku at a prime cost of between two and three taels per
                                ton.</p>
                            <p>Submitted with respect and courtesy.</p>

                            the correspondence between Prince Kung and myself in relation to the

                            appoint such an officer, still, for personal reasons, and as another
                            mark of his confidence in us, he waives the point, and recognizes Mr.

                                <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affairs,
                                    herewith sends a reply.</p>
                                <p>I recently received your excellency’s despatch, in which you
                                    informed me “that the President of the United States having
                                    promoted George P. Seward, now American consul at Shanghai, to
                                    be United Slates consul general at that port, you request me to
                                    notify the same to the governor of Kiangsu, in order that he may
                                    co-operate with Mr. Seward in the conduct of public affairs,”
                                    &amp;c.</p>
                                <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0390"/>
                                <p>On looking into this matter it appears to me that a consul
                                    general properly ranks with a treasurer or judge of a province,
                                    and this point was discussed in some communications which passed
                                    “between their excellencies the two imperial commissioners
                                    Kweiliang and Hwashana and the Hon. Mr. Reed. The latter, in his
                                    reply of November 10, 1858, says: “The question of the relative
                                    rank of consuls general does not arise with the United States,
                                    which has no such officer in China.” In the despatch under reply
                                    you inform me that Mr. Seward has now been promoted from a
                                    consul to be a consul general, and though Mr. Reed’s despatch
                                    states that the United States government has no such office as a
                                    consul general, <note n="*" xml:id="d402fn1">The apparent
                                        discrepancy between this quotation from Mr. Reed’s reply and
                                        the former is owing somewhat to the arrangement of the
                                        Chinese version, which, by a different punctuation, can be
                                        made to mean “that, as there are no United States consuls
                                        general in China, it is needless to discuss their relative
                                        rank,” or, “as the United States government appoints no such
                                        officer as a consul general, his relative rank in China need
                                        not be discussed,” and not to any disposition to pervert the
                                            meaning.—<hi rend="italic">Trans.</hi></note> yet, as
                                    your excellency has conducted the business and intercourse
                                    between our two nations in an equitable and honorable manner,
                                    and this post of consul general has been newly established, it
                                    will be both proper and expedient to inform the superintendent
                                    of customs and the governor of Kiangsu, Li, of the same, that he
                                    may notify the treasurer and judge of that province and the
                                    collectors of customs at the open ports of the same, who will
                                    recognize Mr. Seward as such, and co-operate amicably with him
                                    on all occasions that require united action, and treat him in
                                    the same kind and respectful manner as is shown to the consuls
                                    general of all other nations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have great pleasure in acknowledging the
                            missing despatches referred to in my despatch No. 63. I have received
                            yours to No. 44, inclusive; I have also received No. 46, but No. 45 has
                            not yet come to hand. Your despatch No. 40, informing me of the approval
                            of the policy adopted by me, has given me great satisfaction. The winter
                            is broken and the mail facilities are now open, so that I shall be able
                            at once to communicate the results of my more recent actions. I can say
                            in this that my relations with my colleagues and the government are of
                            the most friendly nature. I send with this, marked A, the letter of Mr.
                            Walsh, giving the result of my action in the case of the Scotland. I
                            send it chiefly for the valuable suggestions of Mr. Walsh about
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Sir</hi>: Your kind letter of 15th
                                December reached me at Shanghai, whither I had gone to meet it. Not
                                finding anything from you on my arrival <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372"
                                    facs="0392"/>on the 12th, my fears got the better of my hopes,
                                and I gave up all expectation of a favorable decision on my case.
                                You may imagine, then, the pleasure it gave me to receive next day
                                your despatches.</p>
                            <p>In hurrying off with them to this, I had not time to acknowledge them
                                fitly, and thought you might, perhaps, be better pleased to hear
                                from me at this point, that the Scotland business had terminated. I
                                did not neglect, however, to arrange with Messrs. Russell &amp; Co.
                                for the payment of the courier.</p>
                            <p>I beg now to thank you most cordially, both for your friendly
                                interference in my favor, and for the promptitude with which you
                                acted. I shall hope one day to enjoy the pleasure you promise, and
                                from hearing from your lips all the details of your proceedings. You
                                may rest assured I shall not soon forget the great service you have
                                done me, nor the kind manner in which you undertook and speak of
                                it.</p>
                            <p>The ship was released on the 25th ultimo, and sailed for Nagasaki on
                                the 1st instant. Seven of the guns had been lost by the act of the
                                customs officers, and for these Mr. Perry has reclaimed on the
                                hoppo; but I do not suppose he will pay, and I would not detain the
                                ship for them. The customs people were all surprised at the release,
                                and some of them, who had reckoned on getting rich out of my
                                misfortune, showed much disappointment. What has reached me from
                                that quarter indicates that the confiscation was a foregone
                                conclusion from the first, and that the authorities had resolved to
                                override whatever we should urge in our defence. The words of the
                                hoppo, “I have seized the ship; how can I let her go?” were thus
                                full of meaning; and they show not only how hopeless it is even to
                                expect any officials of his class to decide against their own
                                interest, but how essential it is to the maintenance of justice that
                                our property as well as our persons should be protected by our own
                                national courts, and not left at the mercy of the corrupt provincial
                                tribunals of China. The whole case also demonstrates the advantage
                                of our having a national representative at Peking.</p>
                            <p>The editor of the Daily Press has gone quite wild about the release,
                                as you will see by his paper herewith. But excepting among persons
                                of his class, I believe it has given pleasure to men of all nations,
                                and I have been as warmly congratulated by Englishmen as by our own
                                American friends. Mr. Perry was, of course, very glad. He had taken
                                a hearty interest in the matter, and the decision in his favor will
                                augment his already weighty influence at Canton.</p>
                            <p>The expenses of the ship have been heavy, but if she now escapes the
                                Alabama the business will still result prosperously, the Japanese
                                having been patient and faithful to their engagement despite their
                                disappointment as to time. I trust the guns will now do good
                                service, not in war with any foreigners, but in maintaining peace
                                among themselves, and by that means increasing the ability of the
                                government to fulfil its obligations to us.</p>
                            <p>I have read, with the attention it deserves, Sir Frederick Brace’s
                                admirable letter to you, and recognize in his remarks a largeness of
                                view and a liberality of sentiment which command my sincere respect.
                                His treatment of the Scotland case was what I ought to have expected
                                from these qualities of his character, and if I gave him less credit
                                for them than he was entitled to, I hope my present acknowledgment
                                will procure me pardon.</p>
                            <p>It is most agreeable to me to find that Sir Frederick has not been
                                misled by the untruthful and malicious statements which have been
                                published here respecting my acts and opinions, statements which it
                                would have been beneath me to notice further than I did, but which
                                I, nevertheless, feared might prejudice those who knew little or
                                nothing of me. I need not tell you that I have no such anti-English
                                sentiments as have been imputed to me. I have enjoyed friendly, and
                                often intimate, relations with too many British officers and
                                civilians in China to admit of my entertaining such feelings; and
                                while I never hesitate to defend my own country to the best of my
                                ability, I am unaware of <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0393"
                                />having ever so acted or expressed myself as to give reasonable
                                cause of offence to the patriotism of others.</p>
                            <p>But it may gratify you and Sir F. Bruce, and. justify the generosity
                                which he has shown in this case, to know that before 1 undertook to
                                obtain for the Japanese the guns on board the Scotland, I
                                ascertained that the prince of Satsuma meant to come to an amicable
                                settlement with the English, and that these guns, if they went into
                                his hands, were not likely to be used against them. For prior to any
                                discussion of the order, and after the result of the British attack
                                on Kagosima was known, my brother, at Nagasaki, was invited by
                                Satsuma’s representative there to go to Kanagawa to mediate with the
                                admiral for peace. My brother declined, because he and I thought
                                another method, which we suggested, might be adopted with better
                                change of success, and, so far as we can judge by subsequent events
                                (the peculiar, reticence of the Japanese leaving us no other means
                                of judging,) it was in sequence of these suggestions that the
                                settlement finally made at Yokahama was proposed—this very steamer
                                Scotland having conveyed to that port the envoys sent for that
                                purpose.</p>
                            <p>Thus you will see that what influence we had in Japan was exercised
                                in favor of peace; and I can conscientiously say that such has
                                always been our disposition and our practice, for we recognize the
                                truth which Sir F. Bruce so clearly points out, that the real
                                interests of all foreigners are identical in these oriental
                                countries, and not only identical with each other, but identical
                                also with the dictates of abstract justice and international equity;
                                and every one who knows my brother’s conduct, as United States
                                consul at Nagasaki, during the last five years, can testify that he
                                has acted in accordance with this conviction.</p>
                            <p>You and Sir F. Bruce will not expect merchants to refuse, on the
                                Quixotic ground that they may, possibly, at some future time, be
                                used against foreigners, a profitable order in times of peace for so
                                legitimate an article of commerce as munitions of war. As well might
                                one refuse to sell ships, or lead, or iron, or even books, lest they
                                might assist the Japanese some day to defend themselves against
                                foreigners. The most that a practical man could do in such cases
                                would be to decline to furnish anything intended for immediate
                                hostile uses, and by his conduct and counsel to discourage hostile
                                feelings. This is what we have endeavored to do always, and the case
                                which has been before you makes no exception to the statement.</p>
                            <p>We do not know precisely where these guns per Scotland will be
                                mounted, but we believe they are intended not for hostilities
                                against foreigners, but to strengthen the Tycoon and his friends, of
                                the party of progress, in dealing with such men as the Prince of
                                Nagata and the party of reaction. Satsuma appears to have enrolled
                                himself with the former, and has proved his adherence by assisting
                                to subdue the revolt which Nagata had raised in his territory.
                                Indeed, it is believed by many, as it is asserted by Satsuma’s
                                people, that his only serious question with the Tycoon’s government
                                has been respecting the monopoly of the foreign trade to the
                                “imperial’’ ports; his demand being that he shall be allowed to open
                                one of his own ports to foreigners; and since he is a large producer
                                of the articles demanded by foreigners, which he has now to send to
                                Nagasaki and Yokahama for sale, paying heavy duties there, it is
                                altogether likely that such is the case.</p>
                            <p>As to the lamentable murder of Mr. Richardson, no one who can examine
                                the matter impartially will fail to see that it was not a deliberate
                                thing, but the result of the heat of the moment, under a sense of
                                the gross affront which the party attacked had, doubtless, without
                                intention, given to an old dignitary who had been accustomed to the
                                most servile respect, and who had not learned to adapt himself to
                                the extraordinary liberty granted to foreigners. This view is
                                supported by the facts that Satsuma’s officers had previously rather
                                distinguished themselves by their civilities to and intercourse with
                                foreigners, and that in no other case had any of his people been
                                identified with attacks upon them.</p>
                            <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0394"/>
                            <p>Looking from this point of view, I cannot join in the cry which has
                                of late been raised against this prince, but believe that he remains
                                on the liberal side, notwithstanding the provocations to a different
                                policy recently given him. The guns per Scotland can only go to him
                                with the assent of the Tycoon. If he gets them, therefore, the
                                circumstance would attest the correctness of the views above
                                expressed, for I think it cannot be reasonably doubted that the
                                Tycoon and his party are desirous to deal liberally and faithfully
                                with foreign nations. They are embarrassed by a strong reactionary
                                party, whose arguments foreigners themselves have done too much to
                                strengthen, and to whom the liberals are now, and may be for a good
                                while yet, compelled to yield something in order to avoid overthrow.
                                For it is certain that the foreign trade has increased the expenses
                                of living so much that many who had fixed incomes have been almost
                                beggared; and as they are not enlightened enough in political
                                economy to look for compensation to the future, they regard the
                                opening of the country as a disastrous experiment.</p>
                            <p>Our only dependence, then, is upon the steadiness and success of the
                                liberal party, and it appears to me but wise and prudent in
                                foreigners to give them every advantage which a legitimate commerce
                                will afford, and every indulgence not inconsistent with national
                                honor. The choice of foreigners is between such a policy and the
                                enterprise of subverting the political organization and crushing
                                down the spirit of the Japanese people in order to force them into
                                an unnecessary commerce.</p>
                            <p>I do not believe that England or any other civilized power will
                                deliberately undertake so unjust, so unwise, and so <hi
                                    rend="italic">impracticable</hi> an enterprise. If I am right in
                                this belief, then it can do no one any harm to furnish arms to the
                                Japanese, if the treaty stipulations regarding trade in arms be duly
                                observed, for the Japanese government cannot be reasonably suspected
                                of a wish to make war upon foreign nations; no doubt it desires to
                                withdraw some of the concessions it has made to them; but this is
                                because its life is imperilled by the unforeseen effects of these
                                concessions. But how timidly it proceeds to effect its purpose,
                                soliciting, as a favor from the western powers, liberties which the
                                smallest European nation would not hesitate to demand as a right.
                                Surely such a people are not very dangerous to the peace of the
                                world.</p>
                            <p>I do not defend their duplicities, their evasions, the alternate
                                coaxings and threatenings they employ towards foreigners, least of
                                all the horrible system of assassination by which some among them
                                try to frighten us out of the country. But these are the resorts of
                                a weak people. They are not unexampled, and they are not to be
                                prevented by keeping the nation weak. Frankness, liberality, and
                                honor are the virtues of the strong; and if we wish these virtues to
                                appear among the Japanese, we must promote the national power
                                instead of destroying it, recollecting that no government can be
                                strong towards its own subjects which exhibits timidity towards
                                foreigners.</p>
                            <p>It is, I know, commonly supposed that the government of Japan is
                                strong internally. As respects the common people, who have no arms,
                                and are without political influence, this may be true, for a good
                                police suffices to govern them. But as regards the nobles and their
                                armed followers, it is otherwise. Towards them the government is
                                weak, its existence depending on its keeping the majority of them
                                satisfied with it.</p>
                            <p>When the treaties were made the party in favor of liberal measures
                                was in the ascendant; but since then, partly because the poorer
                                princes suffered by the unexpected rise in prices, partly because
                                some saw in the arrogant air and encroaching disposition of the
                                foreigners a real danger for the liberties of the nation, and
                                partly, also, because the Tycoon’s government sought, by limiting
                                the foreign trade to its own ports, to monopolize its benefits, many
                                of the princes who supported the government have fallen away. Until
                                lately it was doubted if the Tycoon could maintain his throne.</p>
                            <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0395"/>
                            <p>I should not despair on this point, however, if foreigners would act
                                considerately, for besides the fact that the government is of old
                                standing, and is showing considerable energy, the common people, who
                                are naturally on its side, are steadily rising in wealth and power
                                through the foreign trade, and will ultimately counterpoise the
                                nobles. Moreover, some of the latter have begun to see that the
                                increased productiveness of the land will enable them to repair
                                their deficient revenues. A few of the more liberal have taken a
                                still broader view, and one of the arguments of the Prince of Kanga,
                                in the pamphlet he is reported to have published in favor of liberal
                                measures, is, that the extra demand for laborers created by the
                                foreign trade will absorb many of the rovers, and other idlers, who
                                now prey upon the country, and thus tend to relieve Japan of its two
                                greatest evils, its hosts of two-sworded men and its haunts of
                                debauchery.</p>
                            <p>That in a nation organized as this is, and isolated as it has been,
                                any noble can be found liberal and intelligent enough to advance
                                such views, is itself a sign that if we will have patience with the
                                Japanese, and give their intellectual pioneers a fair chance, they
                                will progress as remarkably in political science as they have
                                already done in mechanics, medicine, and languages.</p>
                            <p>This very tempting subject has made me ramble somewhat away from my
                                text; but, perhaps what I said may have some interest for you, and
                                satisfy you and Sir F. Bruce that in sending the “Scotland’s” cargo
                                on to Japan I do not act recklessly, or solely on pecuniary
                                considerations, but upon a conviction, fortified by reason as well
                                as by facts, that the guns are more likely to be used for the
                                advantage of mankind in general than for their injury; and that I do
                                no honestly-intending nation any wrong in supplying them to the
                                Japanese.</p>
                            <p>You will have received ere this the good news of Bragg’s discomfiture
                                in Georgia, and of Longstreet’s in Tennessee. It its evident that
                                the war will soon be over now, the seceders being nearly exhausted.
                                I anticipate, however, that they will make another rally or two, and
                                shall not be surprised to hear that Lee has combined their forces
                                and gained some great battle. They will surely not give up without
                                some vantage ground of this kind for negotiations, and their
                                military power is probably still strong enough to obtain it. This
                                done, they will not let another planting season go by without
                                arranging a peace. At the most they cannot hold out beyond the
                                November elections; and if the war shall end even then, we shall
                                have cheaply purchased two things—the extinction of the blight of
                                slavery, and the evidence that our system of government is equal to
                                the severest test that can be applied to any system.</p>
                            <p>Trusting that peace will find you still able and willing to do the
                                nation good service, and wishing you health and happiness meantime,
                                I remain, my dear sir, yours truly,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your imperial highness is aware that
                                for some time past a rebellion has existed in the United States
                                against the authority of the same. I am happy to inform you that
                                now, after three years’ contest, it has been beaten from more than
                                half of the space originally occupied by it, and that it is
                                surrounded by our armies and navy, and must, perhaps during the
                                present year, be destroyed. The rebels, in their desperation, have
                                contrived to buy and arm a few steamers, with no other object than
                                to destroy the peaceful commerce of the United States. As they have
                                no ports in their own country into which they can take their prizes,
                                and all other nations forbid them their harbors, they burn them at
                                sea, and thus violate the law of justice and of nations. One of
                                these steamers, the Alabama, flying before the war vessels of the
                                United States, has come into the seas near the coast of China, and
                                in those south of it has already burnt several vessels.</p>
                            <p>Now this is to request that the imperial government will, in
                                consideration of its treaty obligations, and the friendship that has
                                always existed between China and the United States, and in the
                                interests of universal commerce, by proclamation, deny to that
                                steamer, or any others sailing from the so-called confederacy,
                                entrance into the waters and ports of China; and to the end that the
                                proclamation may be effectual, that the imperial government will
                                instruct its officers to be vigilant against these steamers; and
                                that if by chance any of them shall get within the waters or ports
                                of China, that no supplies of any kind whatsoever shall be given
                                them under the severest penalties, nor shall they be allowed to buy
                                any coal or ammunition.</p>
                            <p>In making this request I invite you to do nothing which is not
                                clearly in the interests of the government or which is inconsistent
                                with international obligations. The so-called confederacy has not
                                been, and cannot be, recognized by anybody; it has no right to bring
                                its strife into your waters; and if it should do so after you shall
                                forbid it, it will put itself in the wrong. Action such as I request
                                will be in the spirit of the present treaty, and of the 34th article
                                of the treaty of Wanghia, which forbids relations with any
                                individual State of the United States; it will strengthen more and
                                more the friendship existing between the two governments, and
                                commend itself to the justice and good sense of the world.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affiars, herewith
                                sends a reply:</p>
                            <p>I had the honor to receive your excellency’s despatch on the 8th
                                instant, in which you inform me that the southern part of the United
                                States has risen in resistance to the government, and that a steamer
                                called the Alabama is now cruising on the ocean, burning and
                                destroying vessels and property belonging to them; you therefore
                                request that a proclamation be issued forbidding her to enter the
                                ports of China, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>It appears from this that by the rebellion of the southern parts of
                                the United States against their government, your country is placed
                                very much in the same position that China is, whose seditious
                                subjects are now in revolt against her; and as it is highly proper
                                to prevent this rebel steamer from injuring or molesting American
                                merchant ships, I have notified the various governor generals and
                                governors of the maritime provinces to issue their commands to the
                                local authorities, that if the steamer Alabama, or any other ship
                                intending to injure American shipping, come into their jurisdiction,
                                they are on no account to permit such vessels to come into any port.
                                They are required to issue a proclamation to this effect
                                immediately, in order to do what is suitable for the general
                                welfare.</p>
                            <p>I have informed the ministers of Great Britain, France and Russia, of
                                these proceedings, that they may notify their consuls at the several
                                ports for their guidance. I also enclose a copy of the despatch
                                issued to the various governors for your excellency’s information
                                and action.</p>

                                <p>On the 8th March a communication was received from his excellency
                                    Anson Burlingame, United States minister to China, as follows:
                                    (Here the original despatch as quoted, except the first
                                    sentence.)</p>
                                <p>The board of foreign affairs is fully aware that a treaty of
                                    peace and amity exists between China and the United States. It
                                    cannot be permitted, therefore, that American citizens coming
                                    here to trade shall suffer injury from any one while living in
                                    the country, nor their ships or goods be destroyed. Now, the
                                    steamer Alabama has been burning American vessels with their
                                    cargoes on the high seas, and she must not be allowed to enter
                                    our ports, still further to destroy their ships; and every other
                                    vessel with similar evil designs must be likewise forbidden to
                                    enter them. We, therefore, hereby notify all the governor
                                    generals and governors of the maritime provinces to enjoin all
                                    the local authorities to keep a careful and close oversight; and
                                    if the steamer Alabama, or any other vessel-of-war, scheming how
                                    it can injure American property, approach the coasts of China,
                                    under their jurisdiction, they are to prevent all such vessels
                                    entering our ports. Let them also directly issue a proclamation,
                                    embodying all these circumstances and reasons for general
                                    guidance. A copy of this despatch has been communicated to the
                                    ministers of Great Britain, France and Russia, as well as to the
                                    American minister, Mr. Burlingame, and is now accordingly
                                    forwarded to the Manchu commandants, the governor generals, and
                                    governors along the coasts for their action thereon.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to acknowledge your imperial
                                highness’s note of the 16th instant, respecting the rebel
                                confederate steamer Alabama, or other cruisers sailing under that
                                flag for the purpose of injuring and destroying the peaceful
                                merchant-men of the United States, and of your having issued a
                                proclamation forbidding <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0399"
                                />them to enter any of the ports of China, and to express my
                                gratification at the very kind and prompt manner in which this aid
                                has been afforded. I have notified the several United States consuls
                                of the same, that they may aid in carrying the proclamation into
                                effect, and take such measures of precaution as may be
                                necessary.</p>
                            <p>As your highness has informed the ministers of Great Britain, France,
                                and Russia of this proceeding, I have likewise conferred with them,
                                and beg to apprise you of their cordial approval of it, and their
                                pleasure at observing how much his Imperial Majesty’s government
                                understands the courtesy of international comity, and the
                                requirements of treaty stipulations towards countries at peace with
                                China. When the government at Washington learns of this act of the
                                Chinese government they will then see how desirous you have been to
                                show your friendly co-operation, and I now anticipate their
                                acknowledgment by informing you of my own sense of the
                                proceeding.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to forward the letter and
                            circular (marked A and B) of Sir Frederick Bruce, in relation to the
                            jurisdiction claimed by his government over leased ground at the ports.
                            You will remember that in my despatch No. 36 I gave a history of my
                            efforts against all pretensions of jurisdiction <pb n="380"
                                xml:id="pg_380" facs="0400"/>over persons or territory under the
                            name of concessions, and stated the accord at which I had arrived with
                            my colleagues, and especially with Sir Frederick Bruce, who wrote the
                            very able letters which I sent you against the whole doctrine of
                            concessions. I am happy to say that my colleagues have been sustained in
                            their views by their respective governments. But it seems that a British
                            consul, in one at least of the new ports, either not understanding the
                            doctrine, or believing that it did not apply to spaces of land leased by
                            the British government, undertook to exercise jurisdiction in defiance
                            of it over leased land. This led to another full and frank exchange of
                            views on the subject between Sir Frederick and myself, terminating in
                            the request to which this letter is an answer, and in his sending forth
                            the circular annexed, in which the non-concession doctrine is made to
                            apply to leased as well as other lands.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In reply to the request of your
                                excellency for information as to the jurisdiction her Majesty’s
                                consuls are entitled to exercise over persons inhabiting lots
                                situated within the limits of ground leased by the British
                                government at the ports, I have the honor to enclose a copy of a
                                circular addressed by me on this subject to her Majesty’s consuls. I
                                may mention that this expedient was suggested by a desire to avoid
                                the state of things which has grown up at Shanghai. The land in the
                                foreign quarter at that place being bought direct from the Chinese
                                proprietor, no conditions have been made binding on the purchasers.
                                The consequence has been a large influx of Chinese tenants in the
                                midst of the foreign population and the destruction of the
                                exclusively foreign character which it was of importance to have
                                preserved for the foreign settlements. It was also considered
                                advisable, from the experience we had previously had of land
                                difficulties, to secure a footing at once at the newly-opened
                                ports.</p>
                            <p>But I need not say that any pretensions to exercise jurisdiction over
                                foreigners residing within these limits are totally unfounded, and
                                that her Majesty’s government would not approve of these leases
                                being extended so as to keep land unoccupied, and thereby interfere
                                with the trading privileges of other nations.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your excellency’s most obedient, humble
                                servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am anxious to prevent
                                misapprehension as to the jurisdiction that may be claimed by
                                British authorities within the limits of settlements formed at the
                                ports of China on land leased by her Majesty’s government for the
                                    <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0401"/>purposes of trade. The
                                lease to the British government gives no jurisdiction over the
                                territory itself. The land remains subject to the sovereignty of
                                China, and no further jurisdiction can be exercised over British
                                persons and property within it than can be exercised over them at
                                any open port where there has been no special lease of land for
                                their benefit. For the authority exercised in her Majesty’s name is
                                derived from the treaties with China, and is not affected in any way
                                by the grant of a lease. The conditions of the subleases have been
                                drawn up, in some cases, so as to confine the sale of lots to
                                British purchasers exclusively, with power to the consul to re-enter
                                should these conditions be infringed. There is no objection to
                                conditions of this nature, provided that the land so leased does pot
                                exceed what is required for the bonafide accommodation of British
                                traders. But if a larger tract is taken than will be sufficient to
                                meet the demands of the trade that may reasonably be expected to
                                spring up, it is not desirable to insist on such conditions, for it
                                would be a harsh proceeding towards the Chinese, and one
                                inconsistent with that friendly consideration for the general
                                interests of trade which Great Britain, in her dealings with China,
                                has been careful to show, to keep any considerable tract well suited
                                for trade unoccupied and out of the foreign market. Where the number
                                of British commercial establishments is not likely to be large, or
                                where the prospects of a remunerative trade are uncertain, it has
                                been found advisable not to prohibit the sale of lots to foreigners
                                other than Chinese. And this relaxation is for the interests of
                                British subjects and of trade generally, because a man is more
                                likely to buy land and build on it, as an experiment, when he has a
                                wider area of purchasers to whom, if he finds no sufficient opening
                                for his trading speculations, he may dispose of his property. In the
                                latter case it has been attempted to remedy the evils of a mixed or
                                imperfect authority by calling upon the foreign purchaser to execute
                                a deed binding himself to submit to British jurisdiction in police
                                cases, and in questions arising out of the clauses of the lease. To
                                such a deed, however, there exist insuperable objections. According
                                to the laws of most countries a man cannot, without the permission
                                of his government, withdraw himself from his natural and submit to a
                                foreign authority, and the attempts by the consul to exercise any
                                such jurisdiction might lead to serious protests on the part of
                                other governments; moreover, her Majesty’s government has not
                                empowered her agents in China to accept any such jurisdiction over
                                foreigners or Chinese, and it is not expedient or politic to advance
                                any such claim. The subjects of other nations, if entitled to buy
                                lots, must be dealt with exclusively by their national consuls, if
                                they are subjects of treaty powers; and if they are subjects of
                                non-treaty powers, it is for the Chinese government to devise a
                                means of making them obey the law. Her Majesty’s consuls acquire no
                                valid rights over them by reason of their living on a lot leased
                                from the crown, or in virtue of any engagement they may personally
                                enter into. Should there be an attempt to exercise jurisdiction over
                                a foreign lessee against his will, the legality of the proceeding
                                could not be sustained.</p>
                            <p>I am aware that this instruction may lead to some inconveniences; but
                                if it is found necessary to apply a remedy, care must be taken that
                                the remedy be one that is consistent with the principles herein laid
                                down.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose (marked A, B,
                            C, D, E) a correspondence in relation to smuggling and arrests on the
                            Yangtse. The strictures of the prince upon Mr. Seward are alluded to in
                            dignified language in my reply, (C,) and were subsequently made the
                            subject of satisfactory explanations. The truth is, there is no more
                            scrupulous or hard-working consul anywhere than Mr. Seward, and at this
                            time none are more ready to admit the fact than the Chinese themselves.
                            The trouble here is that the local authorities, desiring to make a show
                            of activity, send up the most exaggerated statements in relation to
                            everybody and everything. The consuls form a fruitful subject of their
                            attack; but learning at length that their statements are not permitted
                            to go unchallenged, the local Chinese officials are becoming more
                            cautious. The authorities here, exasperated at the undeniable violations
                            of the treaty by lawless parties, are too apt to confound respectable
                            merchants with smugglers and rebels, and to use the same language in
                            reference to all. Time and patience alone are required to correct these
                            things. I do not reply in kind; if I did, the controversy would be
                            endless and fruitless. My practice is to correspond as little as
                            possible, and then to make my letters brief and plain. This course
                            gradually wins their <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0403"/>respect
                            and leads them into a more respectful style. Nothing confuses them more
                            than to let them know that you think their have been wanting in
                            politeness. I am trying with my colleagues to secure a “mixed
                            commission,” which will at least collect evidence not to be denied by
                            either party. Now, both parties send up the most confused and
                            contradictory statements. From these I say one thing, and the Chinese
                            another; from this unpromising attitude we seek an equitable solution of
                            questions. In the interests of justice I sometimes go to the verge of
                            diplomatic propriety in seeking to controvert what I may deem the false
                            statements of their officials.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese feel sensitive when I give more weight to our people’s
                            statements than to those of their people. In an enclosure to my despatch
                            No. 74, which will go with this, you will find a significant
                            illustration of this feeling, where they express the hope that as they
                            believed my statements in the Scotland case, that I will believe theirs
                            as unquestionably in turn. I write the above to show the difficulties of
                            the situation, and to explain the correspondence which I sometimes send
                            you. I believe my relations with them were never better than they are at
                            present. Our frequent interviews have made us well acquainted and

                            <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, herewith
                                makes a communication.</p>
                            <p>On the 20th instant I received a despatch from Li, the governor of
                                Kiangsu, and acting superintendent of commerce, as follows:</p>
                            <p>“I enclose a report from a captain in charge of marines, named Sun
                                Shenching, to the following purport:</p>
                            <p>“While cruising about between Pie-kiang, Hung-kau, and Kaw-miaw, I
                                observed a small Chinese boat, manned by foreigners, and suspecting
                                something from her motions, I boarded her, and found four
                                foreigners, with arms, opium, &amp;c., in the hold; on one of them
                                was discovered a passport from a rebel chief named Yin. I now hand
                                them all over to the proper officer for examination.</p>
                            <p>“The intendant of Sie-chan then had the foreigners brought up to his
                                office. One was named Willie Hart; another, Thomas Hanson; a third,
                                Faniko White; and the fourth, George Shurersy—all of them British,
                                as well as the arms and other articles, and the vessel, which
                                belonged to H. Evans &amp; Co. They were accordingly all sent to the
                                British consul, with a copy of the rebel passport and the evidence
                                taken, to be tried and punished, and a request that Evans might be
                                arrested and punished. Shi Tsai-lung, the master of the boat, and
                                his men, were imprisoned for trial.</p>
                            <p>“The British consul replied to the intendant that only Willie Hart
                                was a British subject, and he should be punished; but that Thomas
                                Hanson was a Dane, and Faniko White and George Shurersy were
                                Prussians, and had all been handed over to their respective consuls
                                for trial. He further informed the intendant that in examining the
                                firm of Evans &amp; Co., it was proved by two witnesses that the
                                American firm of H. Leighton &amp; Co. had chartered three vessels
                                from them, as their account-books could show. They could not know to
                                what purposes the vessels would be applied after chartering, and
                                asked to have <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0404"/>them
                                returned. The intendant decided that the vessel having been found
                                with arms and ammunition on board, was justly confiscated, whoever
                                owned her; and the evidence respecting the participation of H.
                                Leighton &amp; Co., in trading in the same, was very clear. An under
                                officer in the court named Ying-meh also deposed that the said firm
                                had already been convicted of illegal traffic, and punished by the
                                British consul for it, and that it was notorious for the way in
                                which it aided the rebels.”</p>
                            <p>All these facts have been made known to the United States consul, who
                                has hitherto failed to reply to them, and it is generally supposed
                                that he tries to screen them, even if engaged in this contraband
                                trade, and, if possible, to let them off without punishment.</p>
                            <p>On receiving the above, I, the prince, have looked at Art. XIV of the
                                United States treaty, which provides “that any citizen of the United
                                States who shall trade in contraband articles of merchandise shall
                                be subject to be dealt with by the Chinese government, without being
                                entitled to any countenance or protection from that of the United
                                States.” This language is explicit, and the stipulation severe, to
                                induce traders to regard it; but the recent Yangtse regulations
                                contain even stronger rules against aiding the rebels. Since last
                                year I have written several times respecting such practices to your
                                excellency, requesting that they be restrained; one of these
                                despatches related to a foreign steamer going to a place held by
                                rebels—Kwanyin-mun—to which I was honored by a reply as follows:
                                “The conduct of this steamer in thus disregarding the treaty should
                                be denounced, and as soon as the facts regarding her proceeding are
                                ascertained she shall be punished as the law provides. If United
                                States citizens transgress the regulations at any time I hope you
                                will inform me immediately, that I may aid the Chinese authorities
                                in bringing offenders to justice, and so the innocent will not be
                                implicated.”</p>
                            <p>It appears, therefore, that the merchants have been repeatedly warned
                                by your excellency as well as myself, so that the disregard of all
                                laws by the firm of H. Leighton &amp; Co., in this contemptuous
                                manner, is the more surprising. Their former punishment and
                                imprisonment by the British consul for dealing in contraband
                                articles did not deter them, for they are again detected in
                                supplying arms and ammunition to the rebels. Such wilful contumacy
                                should not again be overlooked.</p>
                            <p>The intendant copied out the rebel passport, and the evidence taken
                                for the information of the consul, who ought, therefore, by treaty,
                                to give up the manager of the vessel to the Chinese authorities, and
                                not try to screen him. Why is it then, when the proof is so clear,
                                that the consul has delayed his reply? for this is one of those
                                cases where the treaty allows jurisdiction to the Chinese alone. It
                                was an act of courtesy for the intendant to inform Mr. Seward of the
                                facts, that he might inquire into them for adjudication; but if he
                                obstinately delays all action, and thinks that he can screen the
                                offenders in some way, it will then remain for the Chinese officers
                                to attend to the case themselves, and carry treaty provisions into
                                effect.</p>
                            <p>As your excellency regards this illegal and clandestine traffic with
                                utter disfavor, and desires that it be punished in all cases as a
                                warning, I hope that you will strictly enjoin upon Mr. Seward the
                                immediate trial of the parties in this case, without any specious
                                excuses or delay, so that it may be concluded, and a stop be put to
                                similar and even worse proceedings.</p>
                            <p>I shall enclose a copy of this communication to Li, the governor of
                                Kiangsu, ordering him to attend to the settlement of the case in
                                accordance with treaty, and it is in order to inform your excellency
                                that I send this to you.</p>

                            <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, herewith
                                sends a communication.</p>
                            <p>The superintendent of commerce at Shanghai, Li, has forwarded to me
                                the following report:</p>
                            <p>“The intendant of circuit here has lately informed me as follows: A
                                steamer was recently seized from the American firm of H. Leighton
                                &amp; Co., who had chartered it from the English firm of Evans &amp;
                                Co., detected in furnishing arms and ammunition to the rebels. In
                                her were taken a number of persons—Willie Hart, Thomas Hanson,
                                Faniko White, George Shurersy, and others, who were all handed over
                                to the four consuls of their respective countries to be dealt with
                                and punished according to treaty stipulations. The British, Danish,
                                and Prussian consuls replied that they had examined and punished the
                                men, and the steamer belonging to Evans had been confiscated
                                legally, the British consul making no objection to the procedure.
                                But Mr. Seward, the American consul, had said in his reply that he
                                had sent for Mr. McCready, the leading man in the firm of H.
                                Leighton &amp; Co., who had declared that they owned 192 kegs of
                                gunpowder, and that the matter needed to be most thoroughly examined
                                before deciding it; to which I, the intendant, answered, that this
                                part of the case was involved in the evidence given by Evans; and
                                furthermore, that Mr. McCready himself had acknowledged the facts,
                                and the whole matter had been fully inquired into. Several times I
                                have urged Mr. Seward to adjudicate the case and punish the
                                offenders, but he still persists in adhering to the same course. I
                                beg, therefore, that you will communicate with the American minister
                                at Peking, in order that he may require the case to be speedily
                                settled.”</p>
                            <p>It appears, on looking over the records, that the firm of H. Leighton
                                &amp; Co. has already been engaged in supplying the rebels with arms
                                and ammunition, as I, the prince, have already informed your
                                excellency. In the present instance the British, Danish, and
                                Prussian consuls have already punished their subjects for their
                                complicity in the transaction, and Evans’s steamer has been
                                confiscated, so that, the case is settled so far as they are
                                concerned. But the consul of your honorable country, Mr. Seward,
                                still replies in a crafty manner, refusing to adjudicate it, so that
                                it seems as if he were desirous to get the offenders clear. The
                                prohibition for private individuals to trade in arms and ammunition
                                is well known; but how much stronger is this case, wherein the head
                                of the firm confesses to having privately traded in 192 kegs of
                                powder, and thereby completes all the evidence wanted in the
                                clearest manner.</p>
                            <p>If the consul determines thus to violate the treaty, our own
                                officials have only to maintain them fully and to carry them out by
                                seizing and settling the matter themselves. I have, therefore, to
                                request your excellency sharply to instruct the consul to carry out
                                the requirements of the treaty in this case immediately, and settle
                                the same without any more delays and partialities, so that its
                                results may serve as a warning for the future to all concerned.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge your
                                highness’s despatch of the 19th instant, in which you inform me of
                                the American firm of H. Leighton &amp; Co. having been found trading
                                in arms and ammunition, and the seizure of 192 kegs of gunpowder,
                                &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>I have carefully read this communication, for, as Mr. Seward’s report
                                has not yet been received, I had before heard nothing about the
                                matter. If the report of the intendant is full, and there are no
                                other circumstances connected with the case, the treaty requires the
                                property to be confiscated, and I will instruct the consul general
                                to adjudicate the case equitably, in conformity to treaty
                                requirements.</p>
                            <p>In the despatch under reply it is remarked that Mr. Seward stated
                                that he wished to have the case most thoroughly examined before
                                deciding it; from which might be inferred that there was some other
                                reason, or that there were more points still undetermined. I am able
                                to say that he desires most carefully to inquire into all the
                                circumstances of every case, without any leaning to either side, and
                                that when he has ascertained all the truth respecting this one, it
                                will be decided equitably as between the two parties, in conformity
                                to the stipulations of the treaty. But in this first despatch
                                respecting the case, and when the facts are not yet all known, it is
                                inexpedient to intimate that there has been any partiality, and
                                hence feel suspicious and indignant at his conduct, in order to
                                render the decision of such cases as this more strict and exact.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, herewith
                                makes a communication.</p>
                            <p>In the reply just received from your excellency you observe: “I have
                                heretofore heard nothing of the case of the firm of H. Leighton
                                &amp; Co. having been found trading in 192 kegs of gunpowder, in
                                violation of law, as the despatches respecting it have not been
                                received;” and add in conclusion, “In the first despatch respecting
                                the case, when the facts are not yet all known, it is inexpedient to
                                intimate that partiality has been shown, and hence feel suspicious
                                and indignant at his conduct, in order to render the decision of
                                such cases as this more strict and exact.”</p>
                            <p>Now, on the contrary, this case of H. Leighton &amp; Co. was reported
                                to you on the 23d of last April, with a request that the consul at
                                Shanghai might be ordered to adjudicate the case immediately; but no
                                reply has been received to that despatch. In the report recently
                                received from the superintendent of commerce at Shanghai, he says
                                that the British, Danish, and Prussian consuls have replied,
                                informing him that the guilty parties have been punished and Evans’s
                                steamer confiscated; but that Mr. Seward says the 192 kegs of powder
                                belong to Mr. McCready, of the firm of H. Leighton &amp; Co., and
                                careful examination is needed before deciding the case. All these
                                particulars were stated in my despatch of the 27th ultimo for your
                                excellency’s information and action. The case occurred last spring,
                                or more than half a year since; and there can hardly <pb n="387"
                                    xml:id="pg_387" facs="0407"/>be any other reason why you have
                                not learned all its features than the intentional dilatoriness of
                                Mr. Seward, as any one may see. This statement is not the first, but
                                the second, therefore; and it was owing to the high regard I have
                                for you that I was induced to delay for six months, or more, before
                                pressing the matter.</p>
                            <p>In reference to your remark that there should be no partiality shown,
                                it may be observed that Mr. McCready, having himself confessed that
                                the 192 kegs of powder belonged to him, and no one else had
                                implicated him, has thereby completed all the evidence wanted, and
                                removed all grounds for partiality. The truth of the whole affair
                                is, that the ease is a plain violation of the treaty, and Mr. Seward
                                should not try, as it appears, to screen the offenders by needless
                                delay in settling it. It is proper, therefore, for me to bring it
                                again to your notice, and request that he may be strictly enjoined
                                to proceed with the case and punish the criminals as required by the
                                treaty. The matter is very important, and it is for this end that I
                                now send this communication.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In your communication of the 27th
                                ultimo, respecting the firm of H. Leighton &amp; Co., which has been
                                engaged in trading with gunpowder, the date of the transaction was
                                not stated; and in the one written last April, there was nothing
                                stated respecting the 192 kegs of powder, so I inferred that the
                                present was a new transaction. I therefore trust that you will
                                excuse the mistake in my reply. As nothing has been received by me
                                concerning this whole proceeding of last April, I supposed it had
                                been already settled at Shanghai, and have not, therefore, written
                                to urge its speedy settlement; but I will do so now, and enjoin on
                                the consul general to investigate and decide it according to treaty.
                                When he has informed me of his action, I will reply to the present
                                despatch officially for the information of your imperial

                            <p>Last December we were honored by a note from your excellency
                                respecting the steamer belonging to Mr. Walsh, which had been seized
                                by the customs authorities at Canton, and delivered to the
                                magistrates for confiscation. We accordingly ordered the governor
                                general at Canton to inquire into the case and settle it.</p>
                            <p>We have now received his report, in which he says: “The steamer
                                Scotland was taking in contraband goods, as guns, powder, &amp;c.,
                                while at anchor in Cum-Sing-Moon, and the collector sent down his
                                revenue steamer Cumfa and seized her. By law and treaty she and all
                                her cargo ought to be confiscated; but as the orders from the
                                Foreign Office direct me to deal liberally in the matter, I have
                                discharged her. It is very desirable, however, that this case should

                            <p>As your note stated, so we now learn from this, that the steamer
                                Scotland was taking in guns and ammunition, but they were from the
                                United States, and were to be shipped to Japan, and not to be
                                smuggled into China. We relied on your representation, and having
                                detailed the circumstances to the local authorities at Canton, we
                                directed them to liberate her.</p>
                            <p>Whenever cases arise between our countries, we trust that your
                                excellency will repose the same confidence in what we say, for thus
                                public business can be easily arranged and satisfactorily settled to
                                the constant increase and permanence of the amicable relations
                                between China and the United States. We therefore send this note for
                                your information, and avail ourselves of the opportunity to wish you
                                every happiness.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen</hi>: I beg to acknowledge your note
                                of the 12th, respecting the seizure of Mr. Walsh’s steamer, and that
                                you directed her to be liberated on my representation of the facts
                                of the case, and to tender you my sincere thanks for the same.</p>
                            <p>In regard to this affair of the Scotland, having gone into
                                Cum-Sing-Moon anchorage to escape the storm, there to take in her
                                freight, I may observe that, as all the circumstances connected with
                                this infringement of the regulations, and the action of the Chinese
                                government in the premises, have been understood, the foreign
                                community in China has highly approved of its proceedings in thus
                                discriminating between an unintentional violation of law like this
                                and a deliberate purpose to break it. The case of the Scotland is
                                therefore not likely to be quoted as a precedent.</p>

                                with the same desire to do justly, their friendly relations will be
                                more and more strengthened.</p>
                            <p>I avail myself of this opportunity to assure you, gentlemen, of the
                                high consideration with which I am your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, herewith
                                makes a communication.</p>
                            <p>The governor of the province of Fuhkien, Leu, has sent the following
                                minute: “In my opinion it would be well for the ministers of foreign
                                nations residing at Peking to notify to the Foreign Office the full
                                name of each consul who is appointed to a port, as is the usage now
                                in this province; it can then be transmitted to the local
                                authorities at that port, who, with the employés connected with
                                commercial affairs, will all know it and can act accordingly. I
                                therefore respectfully suggest this for the consideration and action
                                of the Foreign Office.”</p>
                            <p>It appears to me that whenever a foreign consul is designated to act
                                at any of the maritime open ports, or along the Great river, at all
                                which places they are continually engaged in official correspondence
                                with the native authorities, it is very desirable that the full name
                                of each one should be furnished to this office, in order that they,
                                and all who are officially connected with commerce, may be able to
                                act with the consuls in full accord at all times. The names of
                                consuls appointed by the United States at Ningpo, Shanghai,
                                Tientsin, Ninchwang, Hankau, Fuhchau, and Kin-kiang, have all been
                                made known to me; but if there have been any changes in these ports
                                I wish that such may be notified; and also that the names of those
                                at other ports may be given in, so that a full list may be available
                                at this office. Tie names will then be forwarded to the respective
                                ports for the examination of the custom-house and other officials,
                                who will then know with whom they are to conduct their business. No
                                person will then be able to assume the consular duties and carry on
                                an official correspondence who is not authorized to do so, and,
                                perhaps, thereby <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0410"/>give rise
                                to much trouble and perplexity. The advantages of the course now
                                proposed are likely to be great in the transaction of public
                                business, and I submit the matter to your excellency’s
                                consideration, with the hope that you will favor me with a reply in
                                accordance to these suggestions.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of your communication of the 13th instant, in which you
                                remark, “That as consuls are appointed at all the maritime ports and
                                those along the Yangtse river, by foreign countries, their names and
                                surnames ought to be furnished to this office, in order that the
                                local authorities may be informed of the same and know with whom
                                they are to correspond. No person will then be able to assume the
                                consular duties who is not authorized to do so, and thereby,
                                perhaps, give rise to much trouble and perplexity.”</p>
                            <p>To this I would reply that it has heretofore been the constant usage
                                to furnish the names of every consular functionary to the Chinese
                                government as soon as appointed. However, it occasionally happens
                                that a consul, either from illness or imperative business, leaves
                                his office for a while in charge of some other person and reports
                                the same; the regulations of the consular service allow this
                                practice. But in such cases the deputy consul will always use his
                                own name in his official papers, and never that of the consul; but
                                if such documents bear the consular seal, they can always be
                                credited, and no doubt held of any person simulating it for sinister
                                purposes.</p>
                            <p>I herewith append a list of the names of all the consular officers of
                                the United States now in China for your information.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It has sometimes occurred that when
                                questions have been referred from the consulates to this legation
                                for decision, that their examination has been much embarrassed for
                                want of the Chinese documents connected with them, and it is deemed
                                to be desirable, therefore, to mention to you the importance of
                                enclosing copies of such papers, with their translation, in all
                                cases of appeal to the minister. Your own judgment will enable you
                                to select the important papers needed in each case.</p>

                            <p>“I have sent orders to Mr. Mackay, an assistant in the custom-house
                                at Tientsin, to proceed to Nin-chwang to take charge of the

                                him in the arrangements of the office. I have also directed the

                                Tientsin, and assume the charge of the customs there.”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Though Mr. Seward has doubtless given you
                            the details of the history and the trial and conviction of David
                            Williams for murder, I will give briefly an account of my action in
                            relation to his case. “He was tried for piracy and murder in the
                            consular court, at Shanghai, and convicted,” It was shown that he had
                            attacked the louba Maria on the Yangtse, and was the leader in robbing
                            and killing of three Chinese. The proof was complete. I accordingly
                            issued the annexed warrant (marked A) for his execution, and addressed
                            the letter of instruction (marked B) as to the conduct of the
                            proceedings to be had at the executing to Mr. Seward.</p>
                        <p>A few hours before the time fixed for his execution Williams committed
                            suicide, (see despatch 21 with enclosure, marked C.) After the
                            conviction, and after the warrant for his execution had arrived, he
                            claimed to be a British subject, but Sir Frederick Bruce, the British
                            minister, refused to entertain his appeal. The above are the points
                            where I came into relation to the sad affair.</p>
                        <p>But for the suicide Williams would have been the first man executed in
                            China since the establishment of our consular courts. I am thus brief,
                            because the papers, which are voluminous, have not been returned to me
                            by Mr. Seward, for the reason, I suppose, that he had not clerical force
                            to copy them; neither he nor I have enough assistance of that kind
                            allowed us by the government, and it is physically impossible to copy
                            those papers which appear to be necessary to illustrate the numerous
                            cases we are called upon to participate in.</p>

                                five, of the Americans in Shanghai to attend as witnesses on the
                                occasion, who shall afterwards sign a report of the proceedings. As
                                I return the papers connected with the trial, I shall be obliged if
                                you will send me a resumé of the case, containing the leading facts
                                which were found on the trial, for the records of this legation in
                                so important a case—the first one involving life since the
                                establishment of the United States consular courts in China.</p>
                            <p>I think it will be desirable to report the leading circumstances of
                                the trial and execution to the Chinese authorities, that they may
                                understand the case, as well as learn our determination to carry our
                                laws into effect.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your warrant of execution of David
                                Williams was received on Sunday, the 16th ult. It was duly read to
                                him, and preparations made to carry it out. On Wednesday, the 24th
                                ult., the prisoner became very ill. The certificate of his physician
                                is enclosed; he remained in a more or less unconscious state for
                                several days. On Monday, the 29th, he was considered sufficiently
                                well to undergo the penalty of the law, and was accordingly brought
                                from his place of confinement in the British jail to the jail of
                                this consulate.</p>
                            <p>On Tuesday morning, a few hours before the time set for the
                                execution, he committed suicide. The circumstances were fully set
                                forth in the enclosed printed copies of the report made by Mr.
                                Howard to Mr. Lewis, and the medical certificates attached.</p>
                            <p>It is only necessary for me to add that I fully acquit the keepers of
                                both jails from blame. This I do in view of the defective
                                arrangements of the jail buildings, which render it impossible to
                                completely isolate prisoners.</p>
                            <p>I think that you will approve my action in delaying the execution. It
                                seems essentially inhuman to send a man into eternity who is quite
                                ignorant of what is going on around him.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient, humble servant,</p>

                                <p>I hereby certify that D. Williams was seized with epileptic fits
                                    on the 24th of February; that they continued for nearly two
                                    days, with short intervals between each fit. On the second day
                                    they were much less severe; during the <pb n="394"
                                        xml:id="pg_394" facs="0414"/>third day he recovered his
                                    senses, and eat some food; in the evening he had a relapse, the
                                    muscular spasms being much less severe than during the first
                                    attack. On Sunday morning he seemed to be in a semi-comatose
                                    state, but in other respects much better, and continued to
                                    improve until his removal from the jail yesterday evening, at
                                    which time he was fully aware of his position, and apparently
                                    prepared to meet his fate quietly.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: David Williams, the prisoner, was
                                    brought from the British jail by my self and Mr. Williams,
                                    consular constable, last evening, at about the hour of 6
                                    o’clock, as directed by you. The transfer was effected without
                                    the knowledge of any, except those immediately concerned. He was
                                    placed in my own room in a bed made on the floor. He seemed
                                    quite strong and not averse to talking. The Rev. Mr. Thompson
                                    saw him when he was brought in, and Williams told him that he
                                    was ready to die. About half past 7 he asked if he could see
                                    Carrol, who was in the room below. I said, “yes,” and brought
                                    him up. They talked about their old comrades, and Williams
                                    wondered that so many men who had committed crimes should go
                                    unpunished, while he was so hardly treated. He said, “that it
                                    was not proven that he had killed either of the Chinese; the
                                    statement of one of the witnesses, that three men who came on
                                    board had each killed a man, was a mistake. One man shot two,
                                    and another shot a third.”</p>
                                <p>My impression was that he meant that he was the person who killed
                                    the two Chinamen. He also said, that if he had known as much
                                    then as he did now, he would have shot the French captain, as he
                                    had a fair chance to do.</p>
                                <p>There was more conversation, but the substance of the whole is
                                    given in the above. Afterwards, about 9 o’clock, he turned in,
                                    smoked a pipe and went to sleep, and slept quietly most the
                                    whole night. About 6 o’clock Mr. Williams awoke me, and said the
                                    prisoner had burst a blood vessel. I went to him, and saw that
                                    no blood had come from his mouth. I then raised his head, and
                                    found a wound a little forward of the left ear. A moment after I
                                    found the knife. It is an old three-bladed penknife, with the
                                    small blades broken out; the remaining blade was worn round at
                                    the point, but had been brought to a keen edge, as if it had
                                    been whetted upon a stone. He lived nearly an hour; he said no
                                    word, and did not even groan, or make a movement of any kind,
                                    except twitching of the face and eyes. Mr. Williams had been in
                                    the room and passed out immediately before the act was
                                    committed. He was not absent more than two, minutes, as he tells
                                    me.</p>
                                <p>The matter was duly reported to yourself, and by your direction
                                    to Dr. Boone, but the man was beyond being helped.</p>
                                <p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to send the papers
                            (marked A, B, C, and D) in the case of James White, who was tried and
                            convicted of murder in the consular court at Shanghai, November 23,
                            1863. I issued a warrant for his execution, but before the time arrived
                            he made his escape, (see despatch from Mr. Seward, marked D,) and has
                            not yet been retaken. Mr. Seward calls my attention to his despatch to
                            the department, under date of February 5, and says he would feel obliged
                            if I would add something to his representations. I do not think that I
                            can add anything to strengthen his statements. His language is
                            exceedingly warm, but you would pardon him if you knew how he was put to
                            it to get on with the limited means furnished by the government. He came
                            up here a few weeks since quite in despair, and determined at once to
                            resign. I begged of him not to do so, but wait the action of the
                            government. I do not know how I can state our needs out here more
                            strongly than I have already done. In my despatch No. 25 I gave the
                            force and the pay of the English out here. Now we have the same laws to
                            execute, and the same diplomatic questions to consider. The English, in
                            addition to their great force in China proper, have a superior court at
                            Hong-Kong, where great trials take place; they have an attorney general,
                            to whom all legal questions are referred by the minister and consuls. We
                            have nothing of the kind. The consuls in the first instance meet the
                            legal questions, and then they are appealed to me. I am compelled to
                            decide them that business may go on; but while my decisions are in the
                            archives here, and at the consulates, it has been physically impossible
                            as yet to send them to the government. This is true also of my
                            diplomatic cases. In the concession cases, the flotilla, the Scotland,
                            and Burgevine affairs, and the efforts to secure action against the
                            southern cruisers, I have only been able to give you the merest outline
                            of their history. Dr. Williams has all he can do in the Chinese
                            department—indeed he needs an assistant. I have, therefore, no one to
                            write for me. Sir Frederick, who has precisely the same questions to
                            consider, has three interpreters, two attachés, and ten consular pupils,
                            and he keeps them all busy. The Chinese government, to conduct business
                            with us, besides their natives, have a numerous staff of most
                            intelligent foreigners in the customs service. Mr. Hart, who is at the
                            head, receives about as much salary as our President; the assistants
                            receive $9,000 per annum, and are furnished with a house to live in. I
                            do not ask that our salaries shall be raised—save only the salary of the
                            consul at Shanghai—but that the force shall be increased to the
                            necessary working force. I am for the strictest economy, both at home
                            and abroad, to relieve the government somewhat, and yet meet our wants.
                            I made, in despatch No. 57, a most careful plan for the use of the money
                            now in hand here. I do hope that you will see to it that that plan shall
                            not fail for the want of consideration. I invoke again your personal
                            interest in it. I shrink from making suggestions in the present
                            condition of our country, and yet I hope, by the careful manner in <pb
                                n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0416"/>which I have made them, that I
                            have now sufficiently the confidence of the government to secure
                            respectful attention to the recommendations I am, from time to time,
                            compelled to make. I feel deeply grateful to you and the government for
                            the attention, in the storm of home affairs, you have given to the
                            little I have been able to do.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>Henry Brunk being duly sworn, says: I am employed at Butler’s house;
                                I collect his rents; I was in bed at the time of the murder. At half
                                past nine I was in the bar-room with Webster, Smith and White. We
                                were talking in a joking way. We stopped there till about fifteen
                                minutes of ten o’clock, when we went up to bed together—<hi
                                    rend="italic">i. e.</hi> Webster and myself went up firsts—
                                Webster first, I after him—and began to undress. Webster went
                                outside on the steps and saw White in the yard coming towards the
                                room. Meanwhile we both undressed and went to bed. White spoke to
                                Webster, saying that he had some business with him and wanted him to
                                come down in the yard and have a private talk with him. Webster told
                                him he had better go to his room and go to bed; that he was drunk
                                then, and that he would see him in the morning. White still insisted
                                on his going into the yard. I then spoke to White, advising him to
                                go to his room. He replied it was none of my business—it was a
                                private affair between Webster and himself. Some ten minutes
                                elapsed, during which time White was urging Webster to go into the
                                yard with him. Webster replied, wait until morning. During the time
                                they were talking Mr. Smith came into the room and went to bed. I
                                tried several times to pursuade White to go to his room, but he
                                would not. He then took two or three steps towards the door, at the
                                same time asking Webster if he was going to give him a share.
                                Webster said he would, and then I heard the report of a pistol. I
                                heard two shots and then rolled over in bed, with my face toward
                                him, and raised myself up in bed, and then he fired the third shot.
                                Webster was at this time in Smith’s bed. I sprang out of bed and
                                caught the pistol with my right hand, <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397"
                                    facs="0417"/>and put my left on White’s shoulder. I wrenched the
                                pistol from him and threw him on the floor. I called to Mr. Smith
                                and gave him the pistol; I told him to open the window and call the
                                bar-keeper, who came up and I gave White in his charge. I then went
                                to Webster and asked him if he was wounded. He did not reply. I then
                                put on my coat and shoes and went and called Mr. Butler. When I came
                                back, Webster was dead. I think it was four or five minutes from the
                                time I went for Mr. Butler until I got back to the room. We then
                                sent for the jailer at the United States consulate, and gave White
                                in his charge.</p>
                            <p>Samuel Smith being duly sworn, says: I am at present in the
                                Sung-Kiang force as military storekeeper. I am living at Mr.
                                Butler’s. I was in the room at the time of the murder. I saw White
                                fire the two first shots directly at Webster. I saw Webster after he
                                was dead. White wanted Webster to go into the yard and settle some
                                dispute they had. Webster declined, and said he would see him in the
                                morning. White was sitting on my bed when he started towards the
                                door; and turning, asked Webster if he would go into the yard and
                                settle the difficulty, or if he would give him a share. Webster
                                replied he would. White almost immediately pulled a pistol from his
                                breast pocket and fired at Webster, who was sitting up in bed at the
                                time. Webster then sprang over on to my bed and cried out to White
                                not to shoot, and got out of bed just as White fired the third
                                shot.</p>
                            <p>Dr. H. W. Boone being duly sworn, says: I went to see the man
                                Webster, and found upon his left breast a bullet wound. The ball
                                must have gone directly through his heart. I was shown a wound in
                                the groin, but it did not look to me like a pistol wound. It appears
                                like some old disease. The wound in the chest was sufficient to
                                cause death.</p>

                                force and arms, at the said Shanghai, did then and there
                                feloniously, violently, and with malice aforethought, make an
                                assault upon the body of Samuel Webster, there present, and that the
                                said James White, with a certain revolver which he held in his right
                                hand, violently, feloniously, and with malice aforethought, inflict
                                a mortal wound upon the left breast of the said Samuel Webster which
                                caused his instant death. And so the said jurors do say, that the
                                said James White did feloniously kill and murder the said Samuel
                                Webster, against the peace of the people of this port and their
                                dignity.</p>
                            <p>In witness whereof, as well as the deputy consul, the jurors
                                aforesaid have to this inquisition set their hands and seals on the
                                day of the date of this inquisition aforesaid.</p>

                            <p>In the cause in which the United States is plaintiff, and James White
                                is defendant, charge murder, before George F. Seward, consul,
                                Charles E. Hill, L. H. Stoddart, J. Schenck, C. P. Blethen,
                                associates.</p>
                            <p>The parties being before the consul and the associates duly sworn,
                                the charge has been read to the prisoner, who has been asked whether
                                he pleads “guilty or not guilty.” The prisoner in reply says, “I
                                plead guilty.” The consul advises him to plead not guilty, which he
                                does; and on being asked what he had to say, replied as follows: “I
                                was drunk, and did not know what I was doing. Webster was owing me
                                money and would not pay me; he was sitting upon the bed, and feeling
                                under his pillow as if to get a pistol. I have no witnesses, and
                                nothing further to say. I confirm my evidence given upon the
                                inquisition.”</p>
                            <p>Henry Brunk being duly sworn, says: I repeat my evidence given upon
                                the inquisition. White appeared to be intoxicated; his clothes were
                                muddy as if he had fallen down in the mud; his pants were quite
                                muddy; when he came into the room he staggered some. Webster had no
                                pistol; I examined his bed after the murder. Webster was shot while
                                in his bed. I did not see the first two shots; I was lying with my
                                back towards him. White seemed to be a steady, quiet person; I never
                                knew of his being engaged in anything of this sort before.</p>
                            <p>Samuel Smith being sworn, says: I was present at the murder, and
                                repeat my evidence given on the inquisition. White was very drunk at
                                the time. One shot took effect in the thigh; we supposed at first
                                that it went in the groin; the third did not take effect. I have
                                always seen White very steady, but have only known him a short
                                time—say a month. I never heard White and Webster have any angry
                                words together; they were always very friendly. Webster was sitting
                                up in his bed with his hand under his pillow as if feeling for a
                                pistol. I think that was what made White shoot. I cannot swear to
                                the pistol; it was like the one produced in court. White was about
                                four paces from Webster when he fired. He fired before Webster had
                                taken his hand from under the pillow. Webster’s tone was angry when
                                he rose up, and said,</p>
                            <p>“Yes, I will give you a share;” and with that he put his hand under
                                the pillow. He lifted up the pillow as if looking for something
                                under it. He usually carried a pistol, but had none at the time, as
                                his bed was examined and none found.</p>

                                The charge was that of murder. The prisoner plead guilty, but
                                believing that he was not aware of the technical significance of the
                                charge, and hoping that extenuating circumstances might be elicited,

                                his recapture, but as yet no trace of him has been made known to

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to forward the papers
                            relating to the trial, conviction, and execution of John D. Buckley, at
                            Shanghai, April 1, 1864. He, like Williams, claimed to be a British
                            subject; but the claim was not allowed. A rigorous effort was made by
                            Mr. Eames, the counsel of the prisoner, to secure a reference to the
                            President; but I could not see my way clear to grant his request. Such
                            men as Williams, White and Buckley had so long escaped punishment that
                            they had come to believe that they could take life with impunity. The
                            United States authority was laughed at, and our flag made the cover for
                            all the villains in China. I felt that any relaxation of our purpose to
                            punish the guilty would only aggravate the evils of our situation. That
                            the lawless would find fresh inspiration in the uncertainty of
                            punishment. The result has shown the wisdom of the course taken. There
                            has been a regular exodus of foreigners from China since. I received
                            from Sir Frederick Bruce the following letter, which is in proof of what
                            I say:</p>

                            Chin-Kiang, in writing to me on the decrease of rowdyism on the Yangtse
                            river, states, ‘the steps taken by the United States consul general of
                            Shanghai will have the best effect. I do not hear of many acts of
                            violence now.’ You will be glad of this impartial testimony to the
                            soundness of his action in the cases of Williams and others.</p>

                            he been taken on the evening of the murder of Captain McKennon. Please

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You are aware that you are held in
                                custody for trial upon a charge of murder. My intention, not less
                                than my duty, is to allow you every facility to defend yourself. In
                                order that you may not delude yourself with any false hope of
                                frustrating the law by declaring yourself of different nationality
                                than American, I call your attention to your declaration to her
                                Britannic Majesty’s consul at Nagasaki; also to your letter to Mr.
                                Walsh. It will be well for you, therefore, to see your case
                                thoroughly defended; therein is your only hope.</p>
                            <p>You will be allowed to choose a lawyer yourself. This must be your
                                own expense, as no provision is made for legal services in
                                prosecution or defence by the United States government; I trust to
                                see counsel upon both sides, however. <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401"
                                    facs="0421"/>You will be allowed three days to secure your
                                lawyer; after you have chosen, a selection will be made by me on the
                                part of the United States. You will then be furnished with a copy of
                                the commitment. Upon trial you will be allowed to challenge the
                                associates, and any reasonable objection made on your part will be
                                considered. The number of associates is four; three, with myself,
                                form a competent court to try you, and the judgment made [requires]
                                only the assent of the minister to make it final. Your trunk,
                                pistol, and $30 in money are in my hands; you will please hand over
                                the key of the former, and, after examination, it will be handed the
                                jailer for your convenience. The money you will probably leave in my
                                hands to remunerate, in part, your lawyer.</p>

                            <p>In the case in which United States is plaintiff, John D. Buckley
                                defendent; charge murder; before George F. Seward, consul general,
                                acting judicially; eight associates called in.</p>
                            <p>W. Scott Fitz has heard of the case, and thinks he is biased against
                                the prisoner—told to stand aside. G. M. Boyd is also biased against
                                the prisoner, and stands aside. Mr. E. Hawkins is called, to whom
                                the prisoner objects without any questions—he stands aside. Mr. J.
                                M. Nixon thinks he can sit and give an impartial verdict—he is
                                accepted. Mr. T. W. Stillman is of the same opinion, and is
                                accepted. Mr. A. L. Freeman is also accepted. Mr. H. C. Endicott
                                knows nothing of the case, and is accepted without further
                                questions.</p>
                            <p>The court is composed of the following gentlemen: George F. Seward,
                                consul general United States of America; H. E. Endicott, A. L.
                                Freeman, T. W. Stillman, J. D. Nixon, associates; E. Lawrence,
                                attorney for the prosecution; T. B. Eames, attorney for the
                                defence.</p>

                            <p>Objected to by prisoner:</p>
                            <p>Prisoner claims the right to be tried by a jury of (12) twelve men,
                                and objects to the court consisting of the consul general and four
                                associates, as unconstitutional in a case of felony.</p>
                            <p>Objection overruled.</p>
                            <p>The prisoner, upon being asked by the court whether he is guilty, or
                                not guilty, pleaded not guilty.</p>
                            <p>Charles J. Ashley, being duly sworn, says: I am a sailmaker by trade.
                                I remember the evening of the murder; cannot say as to date, whether
                                it was the 22d or 23d of May. I was stopping in the large house on
                                the French Bund known as General Wade house. I had my meals at the
                                International hotel. I arrived there on the evening of the murder. I
                                saw the prisoner; he was dining that evening at the International
                                hotel. The deceased, Captain McKennon, was also among them that
                                evening. They were sitting nearly opposite to each other. My
                                attention was called by hearing some loud talking and harsh
                                language—so much so, that I spoke to the proprietor of the house. I
                                heard some of the remarks, but do not remember what they were. The
                                subject was secession. The conversation commenced about that. The
                                parties were Captain Abbott and Captain McKennon. They were at first
                                talking about the trouble in the United States. They were not
                                excited. I could not hear all that was going on. The prisoner took
                                part at the end of the conversation. He sat on the opposite side
                                from me. During this high talk, the prisoner got up and left the
                                room. Dinner was not over then. The deceased went out some six or
                                ten minutes after. The prisoner said, as he went out, that he would
                                make the deceased answer for that, or words to that effect. I did
                                not hear deceased make any reply to that. When deceased went out he
                                said, in a quiet manner, that it was always his way to allow
                                everybody to have his own opinion. I left shortly after the deceased
                                left. I went into the hall. As I was going from the dining-room, I
                                saw two parties scuffling in the office—the prisoner and Captain
                                McKennon. They seemed to be fighting; were clenched together as they
                                came out. I was close enough to rub against them. I saw then the
                                prisoner with his left arm around McKennon’s neck. As they came to
                                me the prisoner was stooping. I saw him take a pistol from his
                                sleeve or his breast pocket, I cannot say which; the gleam of the
                                lamp was upon it, and I knew it was some weapon. The prisoner placed
                                it up against the deceased, and I heard the report; it was almost
                                against the deceased. The prisoner then stepped back and passed me,
                                and then turned round and faced the whole party with the revolver in
                                his hand. I saw it distinctly. I could not identify the pistol. I
                                was the next one to the prisoner. I said, “Buckley, don’t shoot
                                here.” He said, “I will, by God.” I heard the pistol click, but
                                cannot say whether it snapped on a bad cap or whether he was cocking
                                it. I ran back into the dining-room as quick as I could; some more
                                were then in there. We shortly after went out and assisted Captain
                                McKennon up stairs; I staid with him and helped to undress him. When
                                he was laid upon the bed I saw the wound; it appeared to be in the
                                pit of the stomach. I saw Dr. Walden feeling the back of the
                                deceased. I did not see the prisoner after that. I did not see the
                                deceased give the prisoner any provocation. I knew nothing of
                                Captain McKennon. I am quite sure that the prisoner is the man who
                                fired the pistol; I am positive of it. Knew nothing of the prisoner
                                before that, except that he was a boarder in the house.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by defendant’s attorney.</hi>—The
                                dispute was about secessionism; they were discussing that subject. I
                                am prepared to say, that the prisoner answered the captain—he was
                                talking about that. I can’t remember the words; he used harsh
                                language. Prisoner was addressing a person opposite. I cannot say
                                whether there was any conversation with Captain Abbott; <pb n="404"
                                    xml:id="pg_404" facs="0424"/>do not recollect the language used;
                                do not remember Captain Abbott’s addressing the prisoner about the
                                San Francisco vigilance committee. The prisoner was talking to
                                Captain McKennon. I do not know what the prisoner said. The dinner
                                was not finished when the prisoner went out. The deceased went out
                                five to eight minutes after the prisoner; I went out with several
                                others, among whom were Dr. Walden and wife, Mr. Lozey and wife. I
                                saw the scuffle when I was going out of the dining-room. I saw the
                                parties coming out of the office door. The prisoner had his left arm
                                around Captain McKennon’s neck; they were both in a leaning posture.
                                The captain is a large man; not much larger than the prisoner. I saw
                                him distinctly after he was laid upon the bed. I cannot say that he
                                was much stronger than the prisoner, but he was an older man. I am
                                sure that the deceased did not have the prisoner’s head under his
                                arm. I could not tell what the pistol was. I saw the gleam of light
                                upon it; could not tell whether it was a revolver or not. The
                                prisoner was dressed in a long dark coat. There were half a dozen
                                people about there. I did not see any blows struck; I am positive
                                that I saw no blows; I was looking right at them; they appeared to
                                be scuffling out of the door. I cannot tell what the Captain did; he
                                might have been striking, but I did not see it. No one was taking
                                any part in it. Mr. Lozey, Dr. Walden, Dominick Lynch, were present.
                                Lynch was close to me; I saw him in the dining-room afterwards. Do
                                not remember any others at present, except Captain Abbott, and Mr.
                                Dow, owner of the bark Emily Banning. No one was interfering when I
                                was looking at them. The struggle did not occupy a half minute after
                                I saw the discharge of the pistol. I was not acquainted with Captain
                                McKennon. I heard of the reward that was offered for the prisoner; I
                                offered to subscribe my share. I never paid, as they never came to
                                me for anything. I heard no one offer to lynch him; am not aware
                                that any one carried a rope in his pocket to hang him with; never
                                heard that before; have heard talk if he had been caught, it would
                                have gone hard with him. He would probably have been lynched. I have
                                no opinion on that subject. Did not notice the captain at the table.
                                He did not appear excited— he was cool; was not angry. Did not
                                appear to have been drinking. I will not say that the deceased had
                                not been drinking at the table; he sat at the same side that I did.
                                Do not remember seeing him rise from his seat; did not keep my eyes
                                on him; was eating my dinner. I did not get through before the
                                others. Others went out with me; do not know why. Captain McKennon
                                came to the hotel that night. Did not hear it stated that he was
                                looking after Dominick Lynch, or that he had a quarrel with him.
                                There was something snapped about the pistol after the shot was
                                fired. I distinctly heard a click. Could not see whether he took it
                                from his pocket or his sleeve. The prisoner was leaning over
                                sidewise in the scuffle. His coat was a long, dark-colored one. I
                                did not aid the United States marshal in searching for him. I gave
                                information to French police, and inquired several times about the
                                prisoner. Did not see any blood on the prisoner’s face; he was
                                facing me a short time. I wanted to get away from the pistol. His
                                face might have been hurt, but I did not see it. Do not know what
                                bystanders said; there was a great deal of confusion after the
                                pistol was fired. I heard no remarks like, “Give it to him,
                                captain.” Was not acquainted with the prisoner, no more than he was
                                a boarder in the house. Do not remember hearing Captain Abbott
                                charge the prisoner with having been sent away from California by
                                the vigilance committee. Do not know who spoke first about the
                                vigilance committee. I heard nothing about it; could not hear
                                everything that was said. Prisoner said, when he left the room, he
                                would make him answer, or something like that. Am not positive as to
                                the words he used. I do not remember the prisoner telling Captain
                                Abbott that he lied; did not hear the deceased say, “You are no
                                gentleman.” I heard something that he would make the deceased
                                answer. I heard distinctly, also, something about a gentleman, but I
                                do not know who it came <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0425"
                                />from. I cannot give any idea of position of the bystanders. Do not
                                know whether there was any interfering.</p>

                                Was a boarder there in May, 1863, and dined there, as usual, on the
                                evening of the 22d of May. Captain McKennon and the prisoner also
                                dined there that evening. I was not sitting near the prisoner, but
                                at the other end of the table, on same side with prisoner. I heard
                                them talking, but could not understand any particular part of the
                                conversation, as I was too far off. There was considerable loud
                                talk. I saw Buckley leave the table. He said, as he was going out,
                                “I’ll see you after dinner.” Heard no reply to that. Doctor Kennief
                                and deceased then left the table. I saw the prisoner and deceased
                                were coming into the hall from the office. Captain McKennon had the
                                prisoner by the hair, and was using his fist. I then heard the
                                report of a pistol immediately after. Captain McKennon said he was
                                shot. Did not see the pistol. Took deceased up stairs from the
                                dining-room; attended him professionally. The wound was in left side
                                of the abdomen, and came out at the spine. Deceased said Buckley had
                                shot him. Was not with him when he died, but a few minutes before.
                                Do not know whether he made any statement before he died. Have seen
                                him frequently. He was a very good, clever man. Never heard any one
                                say anything against him. He was of a pleasant disposition, so far
                                as I can judge. Did not see the origin of the scuffle.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>—Could not hear what they said.
                                Do not remember seeing Captain McKennon rise from his chair. They
                                scuffled from the sitting-room or office into the hall. There were a
                                great many people in the hall—say from ten to twenty; could not tell
                                exactly. They seemed to be rushing out from the office. I did not
                                see any one taking part in the scuffle; was getting my family out of
                                the way of it. Did not see any wound on the prisoner’s face. Was
                                there only a few seconds. Went into the hall after the shot was
                                fired. Don’t remember when Mr. Ashley left the table. Know Mr. Lozy.
                                He was at the table, and came out with me. Position of the prisoner
                                was fronting the door. Captain McKennon was coming out first.
                                McKennon seemed to have Buckley by the hair. He was a powerful,
                                thick-set man; was an invited guest of Doctor Kennief. Do not know
                                of any others coming with him. Did not hear any conversation about
                                McKennon being in search of Dominick Lynch; did not know of their
                                having any quarrel. Have known Captain McKennon about a month— from
                                the time he arrived up to his death. Knew him by visiting his
                                vessel; had no particular acquaintance with him. Do not think he was
                                a quarrelsome man. Do not think I could find out his disposition in
                                a month. Was not aware there was any difficulty between Lynch and
                                McKennon about the affair. Was slightly acquainted with the
                                prisoner. Do not remember how he was dressed; think he had a long,
                                dark coat on. The light in the hall was not good; it came from the
                                dining-room. Can’t say whether there was a lamp in the hall. Had not
                                heard of the struggle until I opened the door; from what I saw,
                                thought it had been commenced in the office. I continued to board at
                                the house some time after the affair. Heard some talk about lynching
                                the prisoner if he was captured. I was one of the persons that were
                                looking after him. Heard persons say he would be lynched; heard
                                Dolliver say it. I think he would have been lynched at the time if
                                found. Am not aware that people went about with ropes prepared to
                                lynch him. When I saw the prisoner his head was down. Captain
                                McKennon had his hand on his head, and was putting it down. Heard
                                something about vigilance committee—not distinctly. Did hear
                                something about McKennon saying that he was no gentleman.</p>
                            <p>B. Kennief, being duly sworn, says: I am a dentist by profession.
                                Came to Shanghai the beginning of May, 1863, in the Emily Banning,
                                of San Francisco. Deceased was master of her. Remember the
                                evening—22d of May. Was a <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0426"
                                />boarder in the house. The deceased was a guest of mine. On the
                                evening of the murder he sat on my left at the table. The prisoner
                                sat on the opposite side. I heard the conversation between Captain
                                Abbott and the deceased about the north and the south. The prisoner
                                took part in it. Cannot describe exactly what he said. Know he took
                                part in the conversation. Cannot say what took place exactly. The
                                parties were not excited, in my judgment. Buckley at the latter end
                                appeared to be excited, and went from the table first. Going out he
                                said, “When you come out I’ll see you,” or words to that effect,
                                addressed to Captain McKennon. Deceased, made no reply, that I
                                recollect, nor did he appear excited when Buckley left. Five or ten
                                minutes after the prisoner left, I went out, followed by the
                                captain. I went into the sitting-room. Deceased also came in there.
                                The prisoner was then there. I was conversing with Mr. Dow, the
                                owner of the Emily Banning, and Mr. Eckfeldt, a clerk of Russell
                                &amp; Co., who was a passenger in the Emily Banning. Immediately
                                after the captain came in there were some words took place between
                                the prisoner and the deceased. Then I saw the prisoner strike the
                                deceased over the head with a stick or cane. They got clinched, and
                                commenced fighting, and went on until they got into the hall. The
                                next I heard was the report of a pistol. I did not see the prisoner
                                fire it, but the universal cry was Buckley had shot the captain.
                                They then took the captain up to a room. I followed immediately, and
                                saw where he was shot. Saw no more of the prisoner after that. Am
                                quite sure I saw the prisoner strike the captain first. The captain
                                was a man of exemplary character; he was liked by his officers and
                                passengers; perfectly sober man, and, I think, would be incapable of
                                commencing a quarrel.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>—I am not a particular friend
                                of Captain McKennon. Was with him sixty-two or sixty-three days—the
                                passage over. Was one of the parties at the dinner-table. Do not
                                remember all the remarks made, or that deceased said prisoner was no
                                gentleman—don’t recollect. Cannot say whether I heard the prisoner
                                say anything before the vigilance committee subject was brought up.
                                The discussion was between the prisoner and Captain Abbott; the
                                origin about “secession.” Captain Abbott introduced the subject of
                                vigilance committee, to the best of my recollection. Captain
                                McKennon did drink occasionally; was my guest that evening. There
                                was wine on the table, but we were not drinking freely—a bottle of
                                claret between two of us. Do not know that any one came to the hotel
                                with deceased. I think prisoner went into the sitting-room after me.
                                The deceased went in there. Saw the prisoner when he went into the
                                sitting-room. First saw prisoner strike deceased on the head with a
                                cane; that was the first I saw, and am confident that was the first
                                of the quarrel. Did not see Dolliver there. Dow and Eckfeldt were
                                there. Did not see Captain Abbott there. Do not recollect Mr.
                                Parsells being there. The prisoner struck deceased with a cane. I
                                will swear that he struck him on the head or shoulders. The prisoner
                                was on the opposite side of the room from me; and hearing high words
                                passing between him and deceased, I looked and saw prisoner strike
                                the deceased in the way I have represented. Was not looking that way
                                before, as I know of. Can swear the deceased did not strike the
                                first blow. There was no striking on the part of the deceased. I was
                                looking in that direction when the captain came in, so there could
                                not be any striking. Did not follow them out of the room. Saw them
                                in contact with each other. After they got into the hall I saw no
                                more of it. Did not follow my guest out. Do not think he was in the
                                room more than a minute before the blow was struck. Do not know what
                                was said. I was about the middle of the room. The table was between
                                the prisoner and me. The deceased’s side was towards me. I do not
                                know exactly whether he had arrived at the table or not; it was not
                                exactly between the prisoner and me. The prisoner was sitting right
                                back of the <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0427"/>table. The
                                deceased was getting his hat from off it, and was facing Buckley.
                                Did not try to arrest the prisoner. Did not hear that they intended
                                to lynch him.</p>

                            <p>Do not remember of hearing about lynching. I expressed no opinion
                                that I wished he was caught, and punished accordingly. I did not
                                offer any opinion whether he ought to be lynched or not. Do not
                                recollect the high words that passed. Do not know who fired the
                                pistol. The position of the parties the last time I saw them was
                                close together, tussling like. Do not know the deceased had the
                                prisoner by the hair. I saw no mark upon the deceased, except the
                                pistol shot. Did not see the prisoner’s face bleeding. Do not know
                                the weight of Captain McKennon; he was a small, strong man—stronger
                                than the prisoner, and heavier. Cannot remember who was present, or
                                if those present took part in the struggle or not. I know no one
                                interfered while they were scuffling in the office. I heard Captain
                                Dolliver say, “Let them be.” I was under the impression that the
                                prisoner was rather getting “jessie” than otherwise. There was a
                                number crowding in. Captain Dolliver’s language I cannot account
                                for; no one offered to interfere during the time they were in the
                                room. The prisoner had a long black coat on. I cannot tell how many
                                crowded around; might have been more than 5; don’t think more than
                                20 when they got into fisticuffs. I do not know how many men there
                                were in the hall. Dolliver was within a few feet of them when he
                                made the remark; am not sure he was close enough to take hold of one
                                of the parties. I did not crowd in with the rest; there were people
                                between the parties and myself. I can say it was impossible for
                                anything to occur I did not see; do not undertake to swear
                                positively that no person interfered. Do not know whether Captain
                                McKennon was in the habit of carrying a pistol.</p>
                            <p>T. W. Eckfeldt, being duly sworn, says: I was passenger in the Emily
                                Banning, from San Francisco; had abundant opportunity to judge of
                                the character of Captain McKennon; thought it good; never saw him
                                intoxicated; he was very much liked by his passengers and crew;
                                never saw him use violence towards any one; was at the hotel on the
                                evening of the 22d of May; went there to see Dr. Kennief, who was
                                also a passenger in the Emily Banning, and was boarding at the
                                International hotel at the time. It was dinner hour when I arrived;
                                I called at Dr. Kennief’s room; found he was not in. I sent my card
                                to him in the dining-room, and the proprietor showed me a seat in
                                the sitting-room. I remained there about fifteen minutes when a
                                stranger to me came in. He was talking, but what he said I do not
                                know. Cannot be positive as to the subject. Ten or twelve minutes
                                after the first person there were three or four gentlemen came in
                                the sitting-room from the room opposite, which I believe was the
                                dining-room. The next I heard was a scuffle between parties in the
                                room. As soon as I heard this I ran out of the room into the hall to
                                the door of the long hall of the hotel, some distance from the
                                office. A few moments after this I heard the report of a pistol;
                                stopped some five minutes after, and heard persons saying Captain
                                McKennon was shot; did not see the prisoner <pb n="408"
                                    xml:id="pg_408" facs="0428"/>after that. I saw the captain after
                                he was put to bed; he said to me, I am shot, but did not mention
                                names.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>—Never saw Captain McKennon
                                excited; did not see him before he was shot—that is, did not know it
                                was he who was scuffling. I ran from the room as soon as I could;
                                there was one or two there when I first went in; before I left three
                                or four came in with the captain; afterwards three or four more came
                                in from the opposite room. I was sitting on a lounge when two or
                                three came in, and I then heard the commencement of the struggle;
                                was talking with Mr. Dow; no other person was talking with me. Dr.
                                Kennief had just come in from the dining-room, and said “Good
                                evening” to me, but nothing more; the room was full when I broke and
                                ran away; did not know any of them; have not seen any of them since
                                to know them; there were four or five mixed in the scuffle when I
                                saw it in the office; never thought Captain McKennon was
                                quick-tempered.</p>
                            <p>J. D. Riley, being sworn, says: I am foreman to Mr. Ashley. The
                                evening of May 22, 1863, I was stopping at the International hotel;
                                arrived that evening. The prisoner and Captain McKennon dined there
                                that evening. I sat near the door next to the prisoner—he on my
                                right and Captain Abbott on my left—and Captain McKennon sat right
                                opposite. The conversation commenced between Captains Abbott and
                                McKennon about the trouble at home in the States. After a while the
                                prisoner took part in it, when it turned upon a privateer schooner
                                that was fitted out in San Francisco, which was captured and taken
                                back. Captain Abbott was telling McKennon, when the prisoner joined
                                in and said the privateer was right, and he hoped she would succeed.
                                The prisoner left the table soon after—eight or ten minutes before
                                the rest. He made some remark to the captain about settling with him
                                when he came out. The captain replied, Very well; you are a
                                gentleman. I left the room about the same time as the deceased, and
                                went into the office a little behind him; he picked up his cap from
                                off the table; the prisoner rose and struck him two or three times
                                over the head; they then closed in, and had a fist-fight of it; as
                                they were going round the table it tilted and upset the lamp; the
                                globe fell to the floor, but I caught the lamp, and held it in my
                                hand; as they got to the door I put the lamp back on the table and
                                followed them out; just as I got to the door I heard the report of a
                                pistol; I saw the prisoner; the pistol was in his hand; he seemed to
                                be in the act of firing the second time; as he was backing down the
                                hall some one asked if the captain was shot; he walked towards the
                                door and Captain Dolliver took hold of him; he began to unbutton his
                                vest, and Captain Dolliver walked off with him; I did not go up
                                stairs.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>—I sat near the door; Ashley
                                sat near the other end of the table. There were about thirty-six
                                people at dinner, I should think. Table 25 or 30 feet long; might be
                                less; about 18 people on a side; might have been 20 or 30; do not
                                recollect the first words of the conversation; the first I heard the
                                prisoner say was, the people that sent the privateer out were right;
                                did not pay much attention, it did not interest me; I am rather
                                deaf; the prisoner seemed to be talking with Captain Abbott, who
                                asked him what made him say so? The captain did not arise in his
                                seat when he said prisoner was a gentleman. I understood that he
                                meant it; the latter part of the conversation was about the San
                                Francisco vigilance committee. The captain made no remark about a
                                gentleman before the prisoner left the table; prisoner was going out
                                when the remark was made. There were five or six persons in the
                                office when I went in. I went out of the door with the captain, but
                                he was in the office before me. I stopped to get my cap; was about
                                seven feet from Buckley; when he stood up he was close to the table.
                                I saw the scuffle until they got to the door. The lamp did not go
                                out; was occupied a short time putting it to rights; know Captains
                                Lynch, Dolliver, Abbott, and Purcells were there; do not remember
                                any one else; there were others—about six people in the office—don’t
                                    <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0429"/>think there were more;
                                have seen Dr. Kennief; don’t know whether he was there or not; did
                                not see Mr. Eckfeldt; will swear there were not twenty; there were
                                only two taking part in the scuffle. I beard some one say “Let them
                                go;” did not hear anything else said; did not see any one touch
                                either party; will swear no one interfered in the office; did not
                                see Dolliver interfere; was not ten feet off; was not trying to get
                                into the crowd. Dolliver is a medium-sized man; have seen Mr. Dow;
                                did not notice where he was; Dow and Dolliver were larger than me;
                                all were taller men than me; there was quite a crowd between the
                                prisoner and me; the prisoner was nearest to me; the crowd followed
                                them up; there were blows struck by both in the scuffle; Buckley had
                                his hands on the deceased; the captain appeared to be trying to get
                                off; did not see him have his hands on the prisoner, nor on his
                                head; he might have; did not see blood on the prisoner’s face. Saw
                                the prisoner strike the deceased about the neck and shoulders with a
                                light cane; he struck more than once. Saw Captain McKennon after he
                                was shot; did not see any marks on his face; the prisoner raised the
                                stick and did strike him; there were two lamps burning in the hall;
                                have been with Ashley as foreman ten months; have not frequently
                                discussed this case with him. Ashley did not tell me what he
                                testified the other day; did go into hall; was in the door when the
                                shot was fired; there were a number there, say fifteen or twenty;
                                cannot remember any others; do not know their names; the prisoner
                                had a long dark coat—black suit on; the light was only a little dim;
                                did not hear anything said in the hall; only Lynch said, “Let them
                                go.” Did not hear any one say “Give it to him, captain;” I have no
                                interest in this case for or against the prisoner.</p>
                            <p>G. S. Stephens, being duly sworn, says: I am a pilot; I was dining at
                                the International hotel May 22, 1863; was a boarder there, and sat
                                next to Captain McKennon the evening of the murder; Dr. Kennief sat
                                the other side of him; the prisoner sat nearly opposite. The
                                conversation began about a schooner which was fitted out in San
                                Francisco to go down and take the mail-steamer. It was carried on by
                                deceased and Captain Abbott. The prisoner did not join in at that
                                time. It then turned to the Alabama, Florida, and other confederate
                                privateers. Prisoner then joined in and said that “he wished there
                                were more vessels fitted out as privateers; that he was a southerner
                                and of southern principles, and thought their cause was right.” They
                                were not much excited at that time; then something was said about
                                “vigilance committee;” do not remember what; do not know why the
                                prisoner left the room; he left before the deceased, and said he
                                would see the deceased after dinner as he was going out of the door.
                                The deceased said “Very well, if you are a gentleman;” deceased left
                                in ten or twelve minutes. I did not leave until some time after.
                                After the pistol was fired, was sitting in the room; when I heard
                                the report, I saw the deceased coming in with other parties, and
                                heard him say be was shot. Did not see the prisoner afterwards.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Cross examined.</hi>—The prisoner sat nearly
                                opposite Captain Abbott; was on the same side as the prisoner; four
                                or five persons between them, as near as I can remember; I was not
                                acquainted with either party before; have not referred to the
                                conversation; have not talked it over. Dr. Kennief was at the table
                                next to deceased. He did not appear excited, and had very little to
                                say. I noticed the deceased, he was drinking wine; he did not appear
                                excited; did not rise in his chair at the time he said “You are a
                                gentleman.” It was not said in a sarcastic manner. Captain McKennon
                                was respectfully cool. I thought they were perfect friends. I cannot
                                say how long I boarded in the hotel—three weeks, I think. There were
                                about thirty boarders. Table was about fifty feet long; imagine he
                                was toward lower end, opposite the door; do not know whether they
                                could hear where Ashley sat; think they could hear considerable, if
                                they were listening. Conversation was genera. Captain McKennon
                                addressed Captain Abbott, and the prisoner spoke when the Alahama
                                and Florida were mentioned. <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0430"
                                />Am sure the prisoner took part in the conversation before the
                                vigilance committee was named; they first seemed to get excited when
                                the vigilance committee was brought up; the prisoner was talking
                                with deceased and Captain Abbott. Abbott first mentioned the
                                “vigilance committee;” do not remember the conversation on that
                                subject; do not know if he was provoked by some remark of the
                                deceased; do not remember that they appeared angry; did not see any
                                one excited, except the prisoner, when he left the table; I did not
                                take notice who else went out; know Ashley by name; cannot say
                                whether he went out before me or not; the majority had gone out:
                                only four or five remained. The report was just as I was getting up;
                                heard the prisoner say he was a southerner; do not know that he is;
                                did not search for the prisoner after the murder; nor did J. L. S.
                                subscribe to the reward, or pay anything towards it.</p>
                            <p>Hugh Kennedy, being duly sworn, says: I know C. J. Ashley; saw him
                                last Monday, the first day of this trial. I was standing outside
                                when be came out and spoke to a witness; he told him he must be
                                careful—be on his guard— “you must be very particular in what you
                                say.” He asked how the trial was going; he said all right. I did not
                                hear Ashley tell Kelly that the captain was struck first; he did not
                                tell witness which to say struck first.</p>
                            <p>James Scott, being duly sworn, says: I am steward of the Steamship
                                Navigation Company’s steamer Hu-Quang. The 22d of May, 1863, I was
                                steward of the International hotel, and I carved at a side table,
                                and overlooked the boys. My attention was called (I was in and out
                                of the kitchen and wine cellar) to a conversation. The deceased
                                dined with Dr. Kennief; I recognize the prisoner as having been
                                there; I heard them talking politics; they got rather wrathy about
                                vigilance committee in San Francisco. Mr. Dow was at the house; he
                                sent a chit in by me to say he wanted to see the captain after
                                dinner. I went into the office and saw Mr. Dow and another gentleman
                                there. Buckley was sitting near a round ring-po table with Captain
                                Lynch. I wanted to deliver the chit to the captain; he came in with
                                Dolliver, Abbott, and others. Buckley had a cane in his hand. I
                                spoke to the captain, saying there was a person waiting to see him.
                                Buckley then rose and struck the captain, saying, “If you are a man
                                resent that, or defend yourself;” and then a scuffle ensued. Did not
                                hear either make any other remark. They scuffled towards the door,
                                the deceased striking the prisoner. About three minutes elapsed in
                                scuffle to the passage-way, and then I saw a weapon in prisoner’s
                                hand; could not tell what it was; immediately after I heard the
                                report of a pistol. Ashley was on the opposite side; he said,
                                “Buckley, don’t shoot anybody here.” He had then fired, and had the
                                pistol in his hand, cocked, and replied, “By God, I will.” Backing
                                himself out of the passage, I saw no more of him. The captain was
                                carried up stairs and his wound examined. They had a hand-to-hand
                                fight I was within two or three feet of the prisoner when I saw the
                                glance of the pistol. I saw Purcells run. The deceased had no weapon
                                in his hand; saw him strike Buckley with his fists; did not see
                                Buckley return the blow, when they were scuffling, after he struck
                                with the cane. I had heard nothing of the deceased before he said
                                “By Cod, I am shot!”</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>—I keep the wine cards. Dinner
                                was nearly over; when I went out some had left the table; there were
                                persons there generally. I generally sold considerable wine; do not
                                remember how much Dr. Kennief ordered; he went in with deceased. I
                                remember snatches of conversation. The cane was a small ratan; the
                                prisoner struck deceased over the shoulders; it was intended as an
                                insult to the captain, and he had no chance to speak before Buckley
                                struck him. Buckley was standing up; Captain Lynch was sitting on a
                                chair. I did not get further than the middle of the room; there was
                                a sofa in the corner of the room. Buckley was at the table, about
                                eight feet from the door; he advanced towards the captain as he came
                                in, and made the assault. The people interfered to part them; saw no
                                one strike except the captain. I <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411"
                                    facs="0431"/>know Dolliver; he was in the crowd and tried to
                                part them. The deceased had the best of the trouble. Abbott also
                                tried to part them. Do not remember the deceased having hold of the
                                prisoner’s hair. Lynch said, “Let them be.” I lived there a month
                                and a half after that. There were from fifty to sixty people there
                                to dinner; most of them had left the table and gone out. I heard of
                                people searching for Buckley; heard say if he was caught he would be
                                hung; do not think any lynching would have been done; did not
                                interfere. Could not say how many blows were struck. Was a witness
                                here before, on Lynch’s trial. The deceased had no chance; to my
                                mind, he could whip Buckley; did not see any blood on prisoner’s
                                face; saw deceased strike the prisoner a good many times, and he did
                                not strike back; am not sure that he did not address any remarks to
                                the prisoner. I never saw any one have a pistol there before. Do not
                                know who came with deceased to the hotel; when the dinner bell was
                                rung they all came in together. Abbott and Kennief lived in the same
                                house. Do not remember Dolliver speaking about Lynch; Dolliver was
                                very much annoyed, and took a prominent part; do not remember
                                hearing him say “Let them be;” Lynch said that; the other did not
                                wish to see anything of the kind going on; they tried to pull them
                                apart—tried to pull the captain away; cannot swear which they pulled
                                on; did not see prisoner after the struggle; did not see blood on
                                his face. There were good lights right over where the fight
                                occurred. They were all in the hall together. I have seen the
                                prisoner before; he boarded at the hotel a month and a half; he had
                                never been in a row before, and always conducted himself properly.
                                Never heard Dolliver say anything about the prisoner. The prisoner
                                kept company with Dominick Lynch. I have been in Shanghai about
                                eight months.</p>

                            <p>S. B. Quick, being duly sworn, says: I was in Shanghai in May last,
                                and remember the 22d instant. I know the prisoner; saw him between
                                eight and nine o’clock that evening; he had the appearance of having
                                been in a scuffle with some one; he was bruised and cut on the
                                cheek; it was not bleeding when I saw him. I asked if he had been
                                hurt; there were spots of blood upon his shirt-bosom. I knew of the
                                search that was made for him; I was living in a Chinese bazaar; they
                                searched there for him; Baron, the pilot, Clemens, Hathaway, and
                                Dolliver were the parties; they were around my house. I asked them
                                what they were there for. They replied, to find Buckley; that it
                                would not be well for him if they found him.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>—I made a statement on the 25th
                                of May before the consul. I met Barker that night. I remember
                                Langan; he was in my house; he came in; Barker saw me first; Buckley
                                was up at my house, and he wanted me to go up; I went up and saw
                                Buckley there; that was the occasion that I saw blood; he told me he
                                had been at the dinner table, and that a discussion arose, about
                                which I knew nothing, and Captain McKennon struck him; and he showed
                                me the marks and said there were two or three others struck at him.
                                That is all I remember of; he said that McKennon struck him.</p>
                            <p>Edward Dias, being duly sworn, says: I have not been acquainted with
                                the prisoner long; saw him the night of the murder; it was between
                                seven and eight o’clock p. m., on the 22d of May. He was disfigured
                                about the face; blood on it and sores. I fancied that he had been
                                struck by the blood.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>—His appearance was not as if
                                he had been in a severe row or fight. He did not speak to me. I saw
                                him on the “Bund;” did not speak. I saw him as he went by; I knew
                                him by sight; I remarked to a party in the house about it. I am in
                                her Majesty’s jail now for desertion.</p>
                            <p>William Richards, being duly sworn, says: I was in Shanghai in May
                                last. Knew the prisoner by sight; he came into Langan’s the night of
                                the affray. He was cut in the right eye, and had blood on his face
                                and shirt. Some parties came into Langan’s and tore up the floor
                                looking for Buckley; they asked for <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412"
                                    facs="0432"/>all of the small-arms in the house; I told them I
                                had no small-arms, but would give them a bottle of brandy. Did not
                                know McKennon; did not speak to the prisoner that night; his eye was
                                cut, face scarred, and face bloody. I did not ask him anything about
                                it.</p>

                            <p>On the 1st of February, A. D. 1864, John Buckley was arraigned as
                                John D. Buckley at Shanghai aforesaid, before George F. Seward,
                                United States consul general, and four associates, without a jury,
                                on the following charge:</p>
                            <p>“John D. Buckley stands charged with having, on the evening of the
                                22d day of May, 1863, wilfully and maliciously, and without
                                provocation, caused the death of one Captain John McKennon, against
                                the peace of the people of the United States.” To which charge the
                                said Buckley, having first claimed a trial by jury, <hi
                                    rend="italic">pleaded not guilty;</hi> and he was, on the 4th
                                day of February aforesaid, by the court aforesaid, found guilty of
                                the crime of murder; all of which fully appears by the record.</p>
                            <p>And now the said John Buckley, by his attorney, J. B. Evans, prays
                                that said judgment be arrested as erroneous; and for error
                                assigns—</p>
                            <p>1st. That the said Buckley was not indicted or presented by a grand
                                jury, as required by Article V of the amendments of the Constitution
                                of the United States of America.</p>
                            <p>2d. That said Buckley was not tried by a jury, as required by Article
                                VI of the amendments aforesaid.</p>
                            <p>3d. That the charge does not support the judgment, inasmuch as it
                                contains—</p>
                            <p>1. No allegation that said Buckley is a citizen of the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>2. No statement of the place where the offence charged was
                                committed.</p>
                            <p>3. No charge of malice prepense.</p>
                            <p>4. No statement of the manner of death.</p>
                            <p>5. No statement of the time of death.</p>
                            <p>6. No statement that said McKennon died of a wound inflicted by said
                                Buckley, or that said Buckley inflicted upon the body of said
                                McKennon a wound in its nature mortal.</p>
                            <p>4th. That the assessors or associates were permitted to separate and
                                go about their ordinary business for two days after the commencement
                                of the trial.</p>
                            <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0433"/>
                            <p>Finally. That the judgment is not supported by the evidence, there
                                being—</p>
                            <p>1. No sufficient evidence of malice prepense.</p>
                            <p>2. No evidence that said McKennon <hi rend="italic">died</hi> of a
                                wound inflicted by said Buckley, or that said Buckley inflicted upon
                                the body of said McKennon a wound necessarily mortal.</p>
                            <p>The precise nature and extent of the power conferred, or intended to
                                be conferred, by the acts of Congress giving to the consuls and
                                ministers in China judicial power, may be matter of doubt. As,
                                however, the decision of the consular court, in a capital case, must
                                be referred to the minister for his sanction, it would seem to
                                follow, as a natural consequence of the minister’s power to examine,
                                that he would have power to set aside a judgment manifestly
                                erroneous.</p>
                            <p>Where it is apparent on the face of the record that the consular
                                court has no power to convict, there would seem to be great hardship
                                in keeping the prisoner in confinement until the case can be
                                corrected by the President. Moreover, if the judgment was improperly
                                rendered, the prisoner has, in common justice, a right to have it
                                reversed, instead of being obliged to sue for pardon of an offence
                                never committed—or, what is in law the same thing, not proved; and
                                unless the power to reverse the decision of the consular court is
                                vested in the minister, it has no place under the acts referred to.
                                Should your excellency decline to reverse the decision of the
                                consular court, I pray that the execution may be stayed, and that
                                the case be submitted to the President.</p>
                            <p>1st and 2d. As to the first and several objections, it is submitted
                                that the case is too clear for argument. The amendments of the
                                Constitution, V and VI, expressly secure, in cases like the present,
                                the right to a trial by jury, and only on indictment or presentment
                                by a grand jury, and an act of Congress authorizing a trial in any
                                other manner is so far void.</p>
                            <p>The word “jury” has, by long usage, received a precise signification
                                at common law, and through the common law, as such, has no place in
                                the federal courts; yet it is always to be consulted for the
                                definition of words used in the Constitution or laws of the United
                                States; and when the word “jury” was used in the Constitution, a
                                common-law jury must have been intended.</p>
                            <p>But, admitting that a jury may consist of a less number than twelve,
                                the argument is the same; for the “associates” cannot, in any just
                                sense, be deemed jurors, as, except in capital cases, the consul
                                decides irrespective of the opinions of the associates.</p>
                            <p>The exterritoriality of the proceedings cannot affect the question.
                                Congress has no power not delegated to it by the Constitution; and
                                that territorial limits of the power cannot exceed those of the
                                instrument from which it is derived.</p>
                            <p>3. But, aside from the unconstitutionality of the court, the defects
                                in the proceedings are fatal to the judgment, for—</p>
                            <p>1. The charge contains no allegation of citizenship, and in the
                                absence of such allegation it does not appear that the court had
                                jurisdiction, the presumption being that all offences committed
                                without the limits of the United States are out of the jurisdiction
                                of the United States courts until the contrary is shown. Upon the
                                9th Geo. IV, c. 31, giving the courts of Great Britain jurisdiction
                                of offences committed by British subjects out of her Majesty’s
                                dominions, it has been held that the indictment must contain an
                                allegation of citizenship.</p>
                            <p>2. No statement of the <hi rend="italic">locus in quo.</hi> This
                                objection, like the last, goes to the jurisdiction, but it also
                                leaves the charge undefined, and it would be impossible to plead
                                this judgment effectually to another trial for the same offence.</p>
                            <p>3. Any indictment for murder becomes an indictment for manslaughter
                                upon erasing the words “malice prepense,” which is the very essence
                                of the crime of murder.</p>
                            <p>4. No statement of the manner of death. It does not appear from the
                                charge whether death was caused by prisoner’s stabbing or shooting.
                                An allegation of the manner has always been claimed indispensable in
                                indictment for murder, and its omission is fatal.</p>
                            <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0434"/>
                            <p>5. It is only by the dates of the proceedings that it appears that
                                the death occurred within a year and a day after the wound was
                                inflicted.</p>
                            <p>6. This objection goes to the whole body of the offence, and it is
                                submitted, that unless the whole system of criminal proceeding is to
                                be swept away, and the government is to be permitted to convict and
                                punish, as the testimony may seem to warrant, without any previous
                                charge, this indictment must be held to be unmistakably bad, and
                                judgment must be arrested on that account.</p>
                            <p>4. If my view of the character of the associates be sustained, and
                                they be held to be mere advisers of the consul, this objection
                                falls; but if they are considered as judges, it was an error to
                                allow them to mingle with the public for two days after the
                                commencement of the trial.</p>
                            <p>Finally. The judgment is not supported by the evidence. I shall not
                                urge the want of proof of deliberate malice, though it seems to me
                                utterly wanting. The possession of a pistol by an old Californian,
                                or even by a man who has been long in Shanghai, raises no
                                presumption that a crime is meditated. That the prisoner always, as
                                most Californians do, carried a pistol, is probably true; but on
                                account of the absence of the only person who was intimately
                                acquainted with his habits, his room-mate, it was impossible to
                                prove this fact. Moreover, the prisoner engaged counsel on Saturday
                                night, and the trial commenced on the following Monday, leaving an
                                interval of one day for preparation. But as to the killing, there
                                was absolutely no testimony, except that the prisoner discharged a
                                pistol, and that John McKennon was wounded.</p>
                            <p>There was not one word of testimony to show that death did result
                                from the shot, or that the wound inflicted by it was, in its nature,
                                mortal. The testimony would barely support a charge of aggravated
                                assault with a deadly weapon, and only by setting at defiance all
                                the established rules of criminal practice could it be made to
                                support a verdict of murder. All the precautions of the law have
                                not, in all cases, preserved the innocent from conviction; and it is
                                of vital importance to preserve intact all the safeguards of
                                personal security and civil liberty,</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, I pray that your excellency will carefully consider
                                the testimony in the case, even if the objections taken should be
                                overruled, and recommend the case of the prisoner to the
                                consideration of the President.</p>
                            <p>It will appear from the testimony, that at the time when the shot was
                                fired the prisoner was struggling at great disadvantage with a man
                                much more powerful than himself; that several persons, not one of
                                whom was a friend of the prisoner, were interfering in the quarrel,
                                though the nature of their interference does not appear, and was
                                probably unknown to the prisoner, and that the prisoner was entirely
                                without aid or hope of assistance. Can it be possible that, under
                                such circumstances, a homicide, even if one were committed, would
                                amount to murder? How many men would have hesitated to avail
                                themselves of any means in their power to release themselves from
                                such a situation? Where was the opportunity for deliberation?</p>
                            <p>I beg to suggest, moreover, that the prisoner’s health is failing,
                                and to urge the importance of deciding this question of the validity
                                of the judgment, without the delay necessarily incident to a
                                reference to the President, if possible. Confinement in his present
                                quarters through the summer would probably prove fatal to the
                                prisoner, and a reversal of the judgment would come too late.</p>

                                to <persName type="to">decision in United States vs. John D.
                                    Buckley</persName></head>
                            <p>To the first and second objections no remarks are offered. If the act
                                of Congress is unconstitutional, the undersigned will be glad to
                                know it, as the idea of committing a judicial murder is abhorrent to
                                him.</p>
                            <p>To the third objection, generally and in detail, he would remark that
                                the commitment of the prisoner, of which the inquisition formed a
                                part, is sufficiently full upon the points made, excepting as to the
                                citizenship of the prisoner; this is dwelt upon in his original
                                letter to him. Moreover, the citizen does not even claim that he is
                                not a United States citizen.</p>
                            <p>To the fourth objection the undersigned finds no prohibition in the
                                act against such separation.</p>
                            <p>To the fifth, if the evidence does not prove malice aforethought, the
                                minister will be able to correct the opinion of the members of the
                                lower court as to an alleged want of evidence that McKennon <hi
                                    rend="italic">died,</hi> and from the effects of a wound
                                inflicted by Buckley; the undersigned believes that the evidence
                                offered will leave no room to doubt on this point. Moreover, the
                                prisoner does not claim that he did not so die.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned is aware that he is not rebutting technical arguments
                                in a technical way. He has no desire to do so, because he has never
                                understood that the government expects that his court will be
                                conducted with reference to the numerous formalities of courts at
                                home. He submits that in this instance there is no reason to think
                                that any injustice has happened to the prisoner from the manner of
                                procedure, and that, on the contrary, if he is allowed to avail
                                himself of the merely technical points raised, a great injustice
                                will be done to the inimitable laws of right.</p>

                                having taken place this day, pursuant to the warrant issued from
                                your office on the 11th ultimo, I have to report as follows:</p>
                            <p>The despatch and warrant were received on the morning of the 24th
                                ultimo. The same day the prisoner was brought before me and the
                                warrant read to him. He remarked at considerable length upon the
                                evidence adduced at the trial, declaring that certain witnesses had
                                sworn falsely. He said, also, that he was not an American citizen;
                                that he was born in Ireland; had lived some time in the United
                                States, but had never been naturalized; that he did not shoot
                                McKennon with a revolving pistol, as generally believed, but with a
                                Derringer; and that if he had had a revolver he would have used it
                                again.</p>
                            <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0437"/>
                            <p>On Saturday evening, the 26th ultimo, I received a. despatch from her
                                Majesty’s consul, Sir Harry Parker, K. C. B., a copy of which, and
                                my answer is enclosed. This morning, at about 9 a. m., the prisoner
                                was removed from her Majesty’s jail to the jail building of this
                                consulate. A force of twelve members of the municipal police acted
                                as a guard in making the transfer, while as many more were on duty
                                at the place of execution. The prisoner was placed in the lower room
                                of the jail until the hour of 10. Admission was allowed to a
                                relative of his, and to Pere de Jaques, one of the clergy of the
                                Roman Catholic community of this port.</p>
                            <p>The details of the execution are sufficiently set forth in the
                                accompanying certificate of the attending physician and of five of
                                the persons who witnessed it.</p>
                            <p>It is a matter of much regret to me that the remark made by the
                                deceased at the reading of the warrant for his execution, that he
                                would have used a revolver a second time if he had had one, was
                                reported in one of the local prints in a manner which, if correct,
                                would have evinced the utmost depravity on his part. I had fully
                                explained the manner in which the misreport had occurred to the
                                previously named relative of the deceased, and would have done so to
                                the public had I entertained any idea the same would be traced to
                                any source other than that from which it actually sprung, or if the
                                slightest intimation had been given that the prisoner felt himself
                                aggrieved.</p>
                            <p>I have only to say, in conclusion, that I trust no similar duty will
                                be imposed upon me again so long as I remain in this office. There
                                is no reason, excepting the absence of appropriate legislation, why
                                American citizens in China, charged with grave offences, should not
                                have the privilege of a trial by jury as elsewhere throughout the
                                world where the institution of civilization prevails. When such is
                                the case, I think it not right to deprive those thus charged from a
                                privilege so dear to all freemen, nor yet to impose upon a consular
                                officer the responsibilities so grave as they are now obliged to
                                assume.</p>
                            <p>The occasion also affords me an opportunity to speak of the
                                disabilities which we are under in carrying out the present system.
                                In this case, fearing to trust the rickety jail building of this
                                consulate, I caused the prisoner to be confined in her Majesty’s
                                jail. For the expense thus incurred, together with a gratuity which
                                I think it is right to hand the keeper, it is likely I shall have to
                                provide from my personal income. I <ref target="http://thought.it"
                                    >thought it</ref> right, also, for many reasons, to engage the
                                services of a prosecuting attorney, the chief of which was, that it
                                would be unfair to forbid the prisoner, who had no means of access
                                to his witnesses, counsel for his defence, and still more unfair to
                                the government to allow counsel for the defence without providing
                                the same for the prosecution. Thus an expense of nearly $200 has
                                been incurred—an amount I would not speak of were there not so many
                                drains upon my limited means—no portion of which I may hope to
                                collect from the government. Similar expenses have been accrued in
                                other instances, and we are continually liable to them.</p>

                                and has been sentenced to undergo capital punishment for the offence

                                to find that his claim to British protection can be sustained; but I

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have had the honor to receive your
                                despatch of the 26th instant covering enclosures which, as
                                requested, are returned herewith.</p>
                            <p>The prisoner, Buckley, was not charged upon his trial with being an
                                American citizen, but he was charged as an American citizen. You
                                will note the wording of the indictment, which says, “against the
                                people of the United States.”</p>
                            <p>It was not thought necessary to inquire into the prisoner’s
                                nationality, for two reasons: because it has never been customary to
                                do so in similar cases, but to accept the prisoner’s own statement,
                                and because Buckley had definitely surrendered himself to me for
                                trial. I enclose a copy of a communication addressed by him to the
                                United States consul at Nagasaki, which is in point. I was informed
                                by the said official that Buckley, while in prison at that port,
                                claimed British protection, but that upon being visited by her
                                Majesty’s consul he said that he was not a British subject. Buckley
                                explains this by saying that he said he was not an Englishman, he
                                now declaring that he is of Irish parentage. Buckley’s counsel
                                objected to the proceedings upon the trial, after the same had been
                                concluded and the minutes had been prepared for transmission to his
                                excellency Mr. Burlingame, upon the ground that it had not been
                                proven that the prisoner was an American citizen. There was no claim
                                made to me at that time or before that he was a British subject, but
                                this was reserved until the decision of the minister had arrived.
                                The case thus stands, in fact, quite the same as that of D.
                                Williams, in which his excellency the British minister refused to
                                interfere.</p>
                            <p>I need not say that, under other circumstances, the idea of assuming
                                any power whatsoever over her Majesty’s subjects would be extremely
                                repugnant to me. The many difficulties arising from the mixture of
                                jurisdictions and the impossibility of receiving evidence as to the
                                proper nationality of individual criminals, are a sufficient excuse
                                for a manner of procedure which otherwise would be highly
                                objectionable.</p>
                            <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>The undersigned hereby certify that they were present at the
                                execution of John D. Buckley, convicted of the murder of John
                                McKennon, master of the hark Emily Banning, which took place as
                                follows: At the hour of 10 a. m., the 1st day of April, A. D. 1864,
                                the prisoner was brought from a low room of the jail buildings of
                                the United States consulate general at Shanghai, of a flight of
                                stairs to a verandah, and thence to the scaffold, which was
                                constructed in front of the same, and the floor upon the same level.
                                He was placed upon the drop, and asked by Mr. Lewis, the deputy
                                consul, whether he had anything to say. He remarked, in reply, that
                                he was innocent of the crime of murder, he having shot McKennon in
                                self-defence; that he was of Irish birth, and had never denied his
                                nationality, but he could forgive those who had perjured themselves
                                upon his trial, and those who had informed upon him, but that he
                                could not forgive Mr. Seward, who had caused the publication of
                                alleged remarks of his at the time when his sentence was read to
                                him, which was false. He then said that he had nothing more to say,
                                and after repeating a few words of prayer after the attending
                                clergyman, Pere de Jaques, forgiving his enemies and committing his
                                soul to God, the fatal noose and death-cap were adjusted, and, at a
                                signal, the support of the drop was instantaneously removed. He fell
                                nearly ten feet, and hardly made a struggle. Upon subsequent
                                examination it was shown that the vertebræ of the neck was
                                dislocated by the fall, and it is probable that he suffered no more
                                than a momentary pain.</p>
                            <p>The conduct of the deceased was remarkably firm and collected
                                throughout. No evidence of emotion or of faltering spirit could be
                                seen. His hands, which were pinioned behind, were tightly gripped,
                                and the almost purple hue they exhibited when the preparations were
                                complete evinced the point of tension to which his nerves were
                                strained. His remarks occupied a period of perhaps five minutes, the
                                substance of which is given above. At the end of a half hour— no
                                sign of life remaining—he was taken down and placed in a coffin
                                prepared by his friends.</p>
                            <p>The utmost care was taken by Mr. Deputy Consul Lewis and Mr. Howard,
                                the marshal, and no untoward circumstance occurred to render the sad
                                duty they were called to perform more difficult.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Please find (marked A) letter to Mr.
                            Seward in relation to the question of jurisdiction at Shanghai. There is
                            a constant tendency on the part of foreigners in making their municipal
                            arrangements to aggress upon the rights of the Chinese, and it is
                            necessary constantly to recall them to the safe ground of principle.</p>
                        <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0440"/>
                        <p>My short instructions to Mr. Seward, who agreed with them, as did the
                            British consul and Sir Harry Parker, were, he informs me, just in time
                            to aid the deliberations at Shanghai.</p>
                        <p>Seeing the determined attitude of Sir Frederick Bruce and myself, our
                            citizens made their action conform to our views. Mr. Seward, in the
                            general interest, came to Peking with the plan agreed on for a municipal
                            government, according to the principles indicated by us in my despatch
                            No. 37. To this Sir Frederick Bruce and I assented. Thus, at last,
                            disappears practically as well as theoretically, as between us and the
                            English, the vicious concession doctrines; and in the place of
                            antagonism, we are now fused into one mass of strength, in exact
                            conformity with our treaty obligations. I will write more fully of this
                            matter when I shall receive from Mr. Seward the regulations, with an
                            account of their operation.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I approve of your action in the case
                                of David Williams, as set forth in your despatch No. 21. As I sent
                                the original papers down to you, I have not the facts with which to
                                make up my despatch to the government. Will you be so kind,
                                therefore, as to send me a brief history of the case. As to the
                                question of jurisdiction, I think we ought not to take jurisdiction
                                of the Chinese in Shanghai, or the foreigners of the non-treaty
                                powers, even though the Chinese authorities may desire it. Our
                                object should be to strengthen the Chinese in the administration of
                                their own affairs, and to see to it that they shall not shirk their
                                treaty obligations. I indicate my views that they may be a guide to
                                you in your discussions upon the subject.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In looking over your despatches, I find,
                            in No. 23, you refer to me for settlement the controversy between the
                            consul and the marshal of the United States at Shanghai.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hugston died, as you were doubtless informed by Mr. Seward, soon
                            after the controversy commenced, from the causes which led to it. I did
                            not deem it necessary after the poor man was dead to spread out on the
                            records any additional evidence to justify Mr. Seward. I only write now
                            to suggest if it would not be well for you to instruct us in China,
                            that, in all cases of conflict growing out <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421"
                                facs="0441"/>of the alleged improper conduct of an officer
                            subordinate to a consul, the consul general shall have power to suspend
                            such officer pending a reference to the minister at Peking, who, if he
                            shall approve the act of the consul general, shall remove such officer,
                            subject to the approval of the government. This course will secure
                            fairness and deliberation, and relieve the service from unworthy
                            officers. I have already, in despatch 72, indicated the course which I
                            think should be taken in the case of consuls.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that
                            General Burgevine after the successful efforts I made to clear his
                            character, (see despatch No. 44,) and while still smarting under his
                            fancied or real injuries, and before he had heard of the action of the
                            imperial government, went over with a portion of his soldiers to the
                            rebels at Soo-Chow. As far as I can learn he was well received, but,
                            from his wounds, he had not sufficient energy to aid them. A bad feeling
                            soon arose between his followers and the rebels, terminating in a plot
                            to desert in a body back to the imperialists under Governor Li and Major
                            Gordon. This purpose was communicated to Major Gordon, who, with the
                            consent of the governor, successfully co-operated to secure the success
                            of the plan. It was agreed by the governor that all who would come over
                            should be pardoned, or not proceeded against by the Chinese government
                            in the consular courts. Burgevine was included in this pardon, though he
                            did not escape with his followers, but was subsequently released by the
                            leader of the rebels, at the request of Major Gordon.</p>
                        <p>After he had escaped, Burgevine claimed that he had not deserted the
                            rebels, and never intended to do so; that they were fine fellows, and,
                            in short, left himself in an attitude of hostility to the imperial
                            government, and subject to arrest and trial by his own. In this
                            condition of his case it was left optional with him by Mr. Seward to
                            stand a trial or leave the country. He consented to leave. He
                            subsequently returned, was immediately arrested by Mr. Seward, and
                            detained in confinement again until he agreed to leave the country
                            again. Such, in brief, is the history of General Burgevine since my
                            struggle with the Chinese government to secure his just rights. I regret
                            the course he has taken. Up to the time when he joined the rebels his
                            record was good; but now I am compelled to defeat his wishes as much as
                            I was bound before to sustain them.</p>

                            affair, marked A, B, C, D, and E.</p>

                            <p>A despatch was received yesterday from Li, the governor of Kiangsu,
                                in which he states: “Since the return of Burgevine to Shanghai, I
                                have heard that he has secretly joined himself to the insurgents of
                                Suchau, and has been enlisting loose foreigners, of whom more than a
                                hundred have successively gone over to them secretly; and, also,
                                that he has been buying arms and cannon for them. I have informed
                                the American consul, Mr. Seward, of these facts, that he may take
                                measures to seize and deliver General Burgevine up to punishment;
                                and have, myself, likewise sent orders to the officers in command of
                                the advanced posts of the army to make all the search for him they
                                can, &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>
                            <p>On learning these particulars, and referring to the thorough
                                discussion which recently took place concerning the case of General
                                Burgevine, and the very strong assurances given by your excellency
                                that he had no communication with the insurgents, but if he had he
                                ought to be severely punished; and furthermore, that, as he has now
                                thrown himself into the service of the rebels to heartily aid them,
                                which is not only a crime against China, but even more a disgrace to
                                the reputation of the United States, I now inform you that General
                                Burgevine has made himself liable to the extreme penalty of the law,
                                if he presumes to return privately from the districts held by the
                                insurgents; and if he is attacked by our troops he will justly bring
                                upon himself his own destruction if he lose his life. I accordingly
                                inform you of these things, that you may send such orders to the
                                American consul as you may deem suitable.</p>

                            <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, herewith
                                sends a communication.</p>
                            <p>The following despatch has recently been received from Li, the
                                governor of Kiangsu:</p>
                            <p>“When Burgevine first went over to the service of the rebels it was
                                generally reported that he was to get steamers for them by purchase
                                or otherwise, and accordingly he laid plans to seize one by stealth,
                                at Lin-Tien, on the river Hwang-Pee, and actually did capture the
                                Kan-Kian, near the city of Sung-Kiang, and carried her off. After
                                this feat he also repeatedly defeated our troops, but having turned
                                the matter over in his mind, he became sensible of his error and
                                sought to have his offence pardoned, and came back to us, bringing a
                                party of foreigners in with him, who were all leniently treated and
                                received.</p>
                            <p>“However, in September last Burgevine again went over to the rebels,
                                under Chiung, and was engaged in the attack upon our forces at
                                Ta-Kian-Koh, where they maintained themselves most bravely and
                                proved victorious, burning the <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423"
                                    facs="0443"/>steamer Kan-Kian, and driving Burgevine and the
                                whole insurgent force back. Soon after, Gordon, by good management,
                                induced several foreigners to leave that side, Burgevine coming away
                                from it as well, having been assured by him and the English
                                interpreter, Myers, that he should be received as before, and his
                                desertion overlooked. This proceeding was reported to the foreign
                                consuls, and further, that Burgevine was to be immediately deported,
                                and kept under strict surveillance, nor allowed to loiter about
                                Shanghai. The French consul, in his reply, advised that he should be
                                handed over to the United States consul to be dealt with; but Consul
                                Seward had a partial view of the case, and in his communications he
                                would argue that the Chinese authorities were wrong, and Burgevine
                                was right in joining the rebels; and then he concluded that the best
                                thing to be done would be to have him sent away to his own country,
                                and not punish him, now he had left the rebels.”</p>
                            <p>From this statement it appears plain to me that Burgevine, by his
                                joining the rebels, has not only lost all confidence from Chinese
                                officers, but is a man despised by his own countrymen. In August
                                last I informed your excellency of his presumption in going back and
                                forth from the rebel quarters into our limits, and that if he should
                                lose his life by our forces taking him, or wounding him, it would be
                                the just recompense for his misdeeds. The present despatch from
                                Governor Li informs me that he has reformed, and left the insurgents
                                under the agreement that he shall not be punished for what is
                                passed, and be required to return to his own country immediately. If
                                he should be tried, and dealt with as our laws demand for helping
                                rebels, it would be right to carry out the extreme penalty; but
                                considering the very friendly relations now existing between our
                                respective countries, and also that Burgevine had shown himself to
                                be sensible of his wrong-doing, it will be proper, therefore, to
                                treat him with unusual favor, and not inquire into his crimes,
                                thereby showing the patience and goodness of his Majesty. But it is
                                totally inexpedient to let him stay in the country, lest he be
                                inclined to return to his former practices. And the object of this
                                communication is to have strict orders sent to Mr. Seward to take
                                measures to deport Burgevine to his own country, and to take every
                                precaution that he do not linger in Shanghai, nor anywhere else in
                                China, indeed.</p>
                            <p>If he lingers on in this country, or if, after he has gone home, he
                                comes back to China, it will most clearly show that he has no sense
                                of the great and undeserved favor now shown him; and it will be
                                necessary, in that case, to arrest him, and concert measures with
                                your excellency to try him for his crime in aiding rebels. In such
                                circumstances it will be hard to let him off again with so lucky an
                                amnesty as at present.</p>
                            <p>I shall expect a reply, as it is for this object that I now send this
                                communication.</p>

                                have received information from the United States consul at Shanghai

                                    xml:id="pg_424" facs="0444"/>for trial, and did not allow him to
                                go at liberty in Shanghai. But because of his wound received at
                                Sung-kiang in fighting the rebels, which still was not yet fully
                                healed, he desired a short delay to effect a cure, when he would
                                leave China and return to America.</p>

                            <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of foreign affairs, herewith sends a
                                communication.</p>
                            <p>On the 25th ult. a despatch was received from Li, the governor of
                                Kiangsu, and superintendent of commerce, covering a report from the
                                intendant of circuit at Shanghai to the following effect:</p>
                            <p>“On the 25th of March, Burgevine, who formerly aided the rebels,
                                landed at this place, and was arrested by the United States consul
                                and put in confinement. I have to request that this information may
                                be made known to the American minister at Peking, that he may enjoin
                                the consul to instantly deport Burgevine, and thus carry out the
                                original decision in his case.”</p>
                            <p>It is well known that the offence of Burgevine, in aiding the rebels
                                and resisting the authority of the government, is exceedingly
                                heinous, and if he was punished according to Chinese law in such
                                cases, he would be adjudged to the severest penalty; and then have
                                no more than his deserts had brought upon himself. However, in
                                consideration of our present amicable relations, and desirous to
                                show more than ordinary regard, I will waive all further
                                investigation in this matter, if your excellency will deport him to
                                his own country. On the previous occasion Burgevine was allowed to
                                remain awhile until his wound, then broken out again, should have
                                somewhat healed up before he returned home. Why, then, did he not
                                obey, and has now returned to China? If Mr. Consul Seward has
                                already arrested him and put him in confinement, he should have sent
                                him home according to sentence, that he might have no further
                                opportunity to break our laws.</p>
                            <p>I therefore make this communication to your excellency, that you may
                                enjoin on the consul at Shanghai the great necessity of immediately
                                sending Burgevine back to America, and let him never set foot again
                                in China. This is very important, and is the object of the present
                                communication.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to acknowledge your despatch of
                                the 1st instant, respecting the case of Burgevine and his violation
                                of the laws of China, and have now, in reply, to state that I have
                                received a report from Mr. Seward, the consul general, to the
                                following effect:</p>
                            <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0445"/>
                            <p>“This case of General Burgevine was settled and he has been ordered
                                to return to the United States; when I heard most unexpectedly that
                                he had come back. I arrested him, and kept him in confinement five
                                or six days, but as there are no United States ships.of-war here, I
                                have now sent him away in a merchant steamer, and she has already
                                sailed; he is no longer in China.”</p>
                            <p>I have, therefore, only to inform your imperial highness of these
                                circumstances in the case of General Burgevine,</p>
                            <p>And have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the pleasure to inform you that the
                            Chinese government has agreed to the principal of the joint tribunal or
                            mixed commission for the settlement of confiscation cases. The details
                            will be left to be settled by the consuls with the local authorities of
                            the ports. The tribunal will be first tried provisionally at Shanghai.
                            This reform was equally urged by the ministers here, and may be
                            considered, looking at the practical working of the treaty, as important
                            as any yet achieved. The ultimate results will be that the cases
                            relating to confiscations will be settled at the ports. Or, if not, the
                            evidence which will come up to us will be agreed to by both sides, and
                            be so arranged as to make a decision by us practicable.</p>

                            attention to the letter (marked A) to Consul General Seward; it cost me
                            much careful labor. I believe it is sound in its views and policy; and
                            what strengthens me in this belief is, that my colleagues, after a most
                            thorough examination of the points discussed, unanimously approved of
                            it, and will send it to their governments as an authoritative exposition
                            of their views. Sir Frederick Bruce, the British minister, informs me
                            that he will send it to her Majesty’s consuls for their guidance. I feel
                            very grateful to my colleagues for their approval, and only hope to be
                            equally fortunate with my own government.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: From many letters received by me from
                                the ports, it appears that a misunderstanding prevails as to the
                                extent of the rights and duties of American citizens under the
                                treaty, and the regulations made in pursuance thereof. I have felt,
                                therefore, that it might facilitate the administration of our
                                affairs if I express my opinion in relation to these questions, and
                                about which there has been controversy. I accordingly address you,
                                and through you the other consuls and my countrymen, giving my
                                construction of the treaty and regulations upon several disputed
                                points, as well as a few directions in relation to ships, passports,
                                &amp;c., and some general suggestions in reference to the
                                co-operative policy agreed upon by the representatives of the treaty
                                powers at Peking.</p>
                            <p>I hold that the Chinese government has the right, as an incident of
                                its un-yielded sovereignty, to enforce its own revenue laws, and to
                                make such regulations as may be necessary to that end. [<hi

                                guidance. “When an application is made by a person claiming to be a

                                granted he should make a written declaration to that effect, stating
                                also his age and place of birth, which paper should be filed. The
                                consul may, however, require such other evidence as he may deem
                                necessary to establish the fact of the applicant’s citizenship. If
                                the applicant claims to be a naturalized citizen, he should be
                                required to produce either the original or a certified copy of his
                                certificate of naturalization, or such other evidence as shall be

                                    [<hi rend="italic">See my letter to Consul General Seward, and
                                    Sir F. Bruce to Consul Sir Harry Parker, at Shanghai.</hi>]</p>
                            <p>With reference to the entrance of American citizens into the Chinese
                                service, I can only gay that there can be no objections to their
                                entrance into the civil service; but there are strong objections to
                                their active participation in the strife in which this people is
                                unhappily engaged. The penalty for entering the rebel service is
                                well known; and there is a decree of my predecessor, Mr. McLane, of
                                December 5, 1854, still unrepealed, against taking military or naval
                                service under the government against the insurgents. In the peril of
                                our interests at Shanghai from the rebels, this decree was not
                                enforced; but subsequent events, leading to the death of General
                                Ward and the Burgevine imbroglio, convinced me that taking such
                                service not only endangered our relations with China, but might lead
                                to complications with other treaty powers. I accordingly expressed
                                myself in this sense in my despatch No. 44, and my views were
                                “specially commended” by government.</p>
                            <p>I therefore reiterate them to the end that such service may be
                                discouraged. The British government has already withdrawn its
                                permission to its officers to take military service, and every
                                effort has been and is being made by the British minister at Peking
                                to induce the Chinese to strengthen themselves so as to relieve the
                                British government, not only front the expense of keeping troops in
                                China, but from the common danger of a Chinese force headed by
                                adventurers. Major Gordon, who has done so well, earnestly wishes to
                                be relieved, but is retained by a common sense of danger until he
                                can weed the force of its dangerous elements, and safely hand it
                                over to the entire control of the comparatively well-drilled and
                                patriotic Chinese officers.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Berthamy, the enlightened representative of France, is equally
                                desirous with the British minister of removing all cause of expense
                                and anxiety to his country, and looks forward with hope to the day
                                when the Chinese shall triumph over their difficulties, and be able
                                to maintain order without external aid. I am happy also to inform
                                you that Mr. Vlangaly, the able minister of Russia, is deeply
                                impressed with the importance of repressing that adventurous element
                                which, if fostered, can only lead to disaster in China.</p>
                            <p>At an early period of my mission I was instructed by the government
                                to cooperate with the other treaty powers; and in my despatch No. 42
                                you will find a history of my efforts in that direction, and of the
                                policy agreed upon. That policy has been fully approved by our
                                government, and I believe by that of every other treaty power. It is
                                briefly this: to consult and co-operate in China upon all material
                                questions; to defend the treaty ports so far as shall be necessary
                                to maintain our treaty rights; to support the foreign customs
                                service in a pure administration, and upon a cosmopolitan basis; to
                                encourage the Chinese government in its efforts to maintain order;
                                to neither ask for nor take concessions of territory in the treat
                                ports, nor in any manner interfere with the jurisdiction of the
                                Chinese government over its own people, nor even menace <pb n="430"
                                    xml:id="pg_430" facs="0450"/>the territorial integrity of the
                                Chinese empire. I call your attention to this policy, that you may
                                know the commitments of our government and ourselves with the other
                                treaty powers.</p>
                            <p>You will perceive that we are making an effort to substitute fair
                                diplomatic action in China for force; and thus co-operation becomes
                                the rule in carrying out these relations. It should be sincere; and
                                to be effective, requires in the first place a predisposition to get
                                on well with one’s colleagues; and in the second, that just
                                moderation which cannot fail to win the respect and confidence of
                                one’s associates. While such are our obligations with respect to the
                                foreign representatives in China, they are equally strong towards
                                the Chinese officials, whether native or foreign; for it is through
                                these that we maintain our relations with China, and any want of
                                courtesy or consideration at once reacts upon ourselves, and
                                destroys our power for usefulness. [<hi rend="italic">See my

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The junk custom of throwing ballast,
                                either mud or stones, into the river, is becoming most annoying, and
                                threatens to ruin the port for foreign shipping.</p>
                            <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0451"/>
                            <p>We are told that large junks could once reach Newchwang; while now,
                                vessels drawing over eight feet can proceed but a short distance
                                above this place, owing to the river becoming so shallow.</p>
                            <p>Since the opening of the port this season, the schooner Melita has
                                become a total wreck on the bar at the mouth of this river with a
                                valuable cargo of eighty chests of opium, and other merchandise; her
                                loss is entirely attributed, by pilots and shipmasters, to the
                                constant change of the channel caused by the discharging of ballast
                                into the river. Foreign merchant vessels have been strictly
                                forbidden the practice under penalty of heavy fines, and are now
                                compelled, while lying in said stream, to discharge their ballast
                                into boats at considerable expense. But they complain with some
                                reason, a great deal, at the apparent injustice, while junks which
                                either lie close to the bank or moored outside each other should
                                discharge ballast into the river, when they might so easily take it
                                on shore.</p>
                            <p>On this matter I would ask your attention that native vessels shall
                                be prevented throwing ballast of any description into the river,
                                subject to the same penalty as foreign vessels.</p>
                            <p>The hull of the Melita now lies in such a position as to render the
                                navigation of the port hazardous, (one vessel has already run on
                                it,) unless the pilot has a clear day when he can see some coast
                                mark to get his bearings and course exact. Under these
                                circumstances, a light-ship anchored in a proper position becomes
                                doubly necessary, and would be more effective than at any other port
                                in China.</p>
                            <p>After many efforts, some parties here have got a capital hulk which
                                they offer to fit out completely for a light-vessel, provided the
                                Chinese government will buy it, and remunerate them for their
                                expense.</p>
                            <p>Last year there were 202 ships arrived here, and already this season
                                there have been 45. Out of this number sufficient port dues must
                                have been paid to appropriate to such purpose.</p>
                            <p>The price wanted for the hulk is very moderate—probably one-third
                                cost of any other light-ship on the coast.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be your obedient servant,</p>

                                Prince Kung relating to the pernicious practice of junks throwing
                                their ballast overboard at Yangtse, and intimating the measures
                                taken to put a stop to it; a translation of which I send for your

                                the vigilance of foreigners interested in the preservation of the
                                navigation, that natives or others who offend the regulations shall
                                be dealt with, and the practice cease.</p>

                            <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, herewith
                                sends a communication.</p>
                            <p>I have lately heard that the vessels coming from the south (<hi
                                    rend="italic">i.e.</hi> from the in sea) which frequent Yangtse,
                                the port of Ninchwang, both those which anchor the stream and those
                                lying along the bank, are in the practice of throwing their mud and
                                stone ballast into the river; this makes piles of constantly
                                increasing size, which prevents vessels that are discharging a
                                lading cargo from coming close into the shore, and involves them in
                                greater expense and trouble in moving their goods.</p>
                            <p>I have, therefore, notified the generalissimo of Manchuria to enjoin
                                on the local authorities at Yangtse, to issue a public proclamation
                                to all concerned, to forbid this practice in the strictest way. Such
                                vessels or junks as do not keep their ballast must deposit it on the
                                sea-shore or in very far from the river’s bank, and no more obstruct
                                the channel for shipping, into which they are no longer permitted,
                                as they have done, to throw it, lest at no distant day the piles
                                made there interfere with the navigation of the river.</p>
                            <p>I now inform your excellency of these orders, and if any foreign
                                vessel should act in the same manner, I trust that full orders may
                                be sent to the consuls there, to see that these regulations
                                (respecting ballast) may be made known to the foreign shipping
                                generally, as they are for the advantage of all, both native and
                                foreign.</p>

                                of yesterday’s date respecting the practice of throwing ballast into
                                the river Yangtse, and thereby obstructing navigation, which I have
                                received from your highness, and the information you give that
                                orders have been sent to the generalissimo of Manchuria to enjoin
                                the local authorities to strictly forbid it, and thank you for this
                                instance of your consideration, which is fully in the spirit of the

                            <p>I have, accordingly, sent orders to the United States consul at
                                Newchwang to do all in his power to carry the regulations into
                                effect, and prevent any more obstruction to the navigation of the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to forward correspondence
                            (marked A and B) with the French minister, Mr. Berthamy, in relation to
                            putting down piracy on the interior waters of China, and particularly on
                            the Yangtse. The plan of Mr. Berthamy proposes to submit to reciprocal
                            search all vessels of a Chinese construction carrying the flag of the
                            treaty powers having ministers at Peking. In my reply to Mr. Berthamy I
                            simply content myself with stating that I have no power to agree to any
                            such plan, and with pointing out one or two difficulties.</p>
                        <p>I may say to you, that I hold the plan to be altogether impracticable;
                            and this view I hold with my colleagues representing England and Russia.
                            In the first place, by it we submit our vessels to visitation and search
                            without compensating advantages. Second, we undertake to police Chinese
                            waters, which is an offensive assumption of power, while at the same
                            time it relieves the Chinese government from the performance of its own
                            proper duties. Third, it takes no account of the treaty powers not
                            having ministers at Peking. Fourth, it is not necessary, for anybody may
                            take pirates now. It would lead in practice to the greatest confusion,
                            and would become the fruitful source of quarrels.</p>
                        <p>With this brief statement of my views, I submit the correspondence to
                            your better judgment.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: For a long time numerous acts
                                of piracy have been committed upon the coasts and in the interior
                                waters of China, especially upon the Yangtse-Kiang, under the
                                protection of flags usurped by adventurers, either native or
                                foreign, and not being able to visit the ships upon which float the
                                colors of another nation, the ships-of-war charged in these
                                latitudes with protecting the maritime commerce find themselves very
                                often powerless.</p>
                            <p>Struck with the inconveniences of this situation, I submit to your
                                excellency a proposition which, if it is agreed to, will result in a
                                prompt remedy. You are not ignorant, Mr. Minister, that the acts of
                                piracy to which I have had the honor to call your attention are
                                generally committed with the aid of junks, lorchers—in a word, by
                                the aid of boats of Chinese construction; but in my opinion it will
                                suffice to put an end to a state of things which brings such serious
                                damage to common interests to give to the ships-of-war of the powers
                                whose representatives in China shall have acceded to these
                                arrangements the authority to visit boats of Chinese construction,
                                carrying the flag of any of these powers. The exercise of this right
                                it is understood will be reciprocal, and will have no other object
                                than to prove if the junk or lorcher is furnished with regular river
                                passes. Boats of a foreign construction would not be submitted to
                                it.</p>
                            <p>I shall esteem myself happy to learn that your excellency will give
                                his assent to this measure, and that in consequence he will convey
                                to the commandant of <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0454"/>the

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of the letter of your excellency, in which you propose that
                                the ministers at Peking shall agree to put down piracy on the
                                interior waters of China, and particularly on the Yangtse, by
                                authorizing their vessels-of-war to stop all vessels, of whatever
                                flag, of a Chinese construction, and that the reciprocal right of
                                visit shall be prosecuted with a view solely of ascertaining if the
                                papers of such vessels are regular.</p>
                            <p>Hailing this proposition as but another of the many manifestations of
                                your excellency in behalf of that common action which has been found
                                to work so well in China, my first desire was to respond in the
                                affirmative. But I find, upon reflection, that I have not the power
                                to do so; that my government alone, and that after solemn forms, can
                                subject the vessels of the United States to visitation or search by
                                another power.</p>
                            <p>It occurs to me, also, that the success of the plan may involve the
                                consent and support of the Chinese government as well as the treaty
                                powers not having ministers at Peking.</p>
                            <p>I will not, however, suggest difficulties, but recognizing only the
                                worthy objects of your excellency, submit the question to the
                                consideration of my government.</p>
                            <p>I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to your excellency the
                                assurance of my very high consideration.</p>

                            <p>Prince Kung, chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, herewith
                                makes a communication.</p>
                            <p>In the despatch received from your excellency October 23, 1863, you
                                made the remark “that hitherto there have been no well-understood
                                regulations established for general guidance in cases of
                                confiscation of vessels and goods by the Chinese authorities.” Now,
                                although the right and power to punish all cases of smuggling by
                                foreigners, either by fine or otherwise, is undoubtedly in the hands
                                of this government, yet it is nevertheless true that, owing to the
                                want of some definite regulations upon these points, much confusion
                                and pertinacious disputing have arisen between foreign merchants and
                                our own officers.</p>
                            <p>In consequence of your despatch, I sent orders to the inspector
                                general of customs, Mr. Hart, desiring him to give the subject his
                                most careful deliberation and examination. He has now come to
                                Peking, and having personally conferred with the various foreign
                                ministers in reference to this thing, it has been decided that the
                                scheme of regulations which was discussed last year shall be
                                adopted, with such changes as the foreign office shall deem to be
                                necessary. When they have all been revised and decided upon they
                                shall first go into effect at Shanghai, as an experiment; and if the
                                result shows that their operation is beneficial, and does not impair
                                or interfere with the rights of this government, they can then be
                                extended to all the open ports, and the officers there be instructed
                                to follow them.</p>

                                concluded in 1847 with China.</p>
                            <p>The King’s government, having been already informed thereof by his

                                with which such excellent relations subsist has willingly rendered
                                to the United Kingdoms, has not been less gratified in learning,

                                the special value which it attaches to this, and that its
                                gratification would be still increased if the cabinet of Washington
                                would please to make known to its distinguished representative in
                                China that very special thanks have reached it for the friendly aid
                                which Mr. Burlingame has lent, in a manner as generous as
                                disinterested, to a power whose distance has not until now permitted
                                it to watch over its interests in China as actively as it has the
                                desire to do, and that it has seen with satisfaction the
                                representative of a friendly power actively in its favor.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to send a letter from
                            Robert Hart, esq., inspector general of customs, (marked A,) in which he
                            requests me to secure the services of three Americans, over 18 and under
                            22 years of age, for the Chinese customs service. They will receive on
                            their arrival in China <hi rend="italic">£</hi>200 sterling each, (about
                            $900, Mexican,) to reimburse them for expenses incurred in paying
                            passage out. For the first two years they will be located at Peking, to
                            study Chinese, where they will be furnished with rooms, and receive pay
                            at the rate of <hi rend="italic">£</hi>400 (about $1,800) a year. At the
                            expiration of the second year the pay of each will be raised to <hi
                                rend="italic">£</hi>600, (about $2,700,) from which it will
                            gradually rise, as promotions occur, to <hi rend="italic">£</hi>800, <hi
                                rend="italic">£</hi>1,000, and <hi rend="italic">£</hi>1,200, and
                            when advanced to commissioners (of whom there are twelve) to <hi
                                rend="italic">£</hi>1,200, <hi rend="italic">£</hi>1,400, and <hi
                                rend="italic">£</hi>2,000. At the expiration of five years’ service
                            they will be entitled to a year’s leave, on half pay. If the Chinese
                            government should decide to dispense with their services, they will be
                            entitled to either three months’ notice or three months’ pay. After two
                            years at Peking, they will be sent by the inspector general to the
                            ports, as their services may be required.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hart is from Belfast, in Ireland, and graduated with high honors from
                            one of the first British colleges. He is a man of most excellent
                            character, and of unusual administrative abilities. The men selected by
                            him, as far as possible, are of the first class. If he shall continue at
                            the head of the service, I do not see why the Chinese government will
                            not put other nations behind it in the quality of its customs force. The
                            pay is nearly twice that of any other <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437"
                                facs="0457"/>country of corresponding service. I hope you will give
                            your personal attention to this, and secure young men of the very
                            highest moral as well as intellectual qualities. They will be brought
                            into immediate contrast and competition with young men who are graduates
                            of Cambridge and Oxford, and who were selected for the British service
                            after the severest competitive examination.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Burlingame</hi>: In a service such
                                as ours, cosmopolitan in nature, and transacting business with
                                people of so many different countries, it would be but natural to
                                expect that, numerically, the United States would be strongly
                                represented. Unfortunately, I have found it quite impossible to
                                recruit in China for our offices. We have no difficulty in procuring
                                seafaring men and others fit to perform the work of out-door
                                departments, and accordingly amongst the tide-waiters, whose pay
                                ranges from <hi rend="italic">£</hi>240 to <hi rend="italic"
                                >£</hi>600 a year, a great many Americans are to be found. Of the
                                dozen commissioners who preside at the ports, three are American;
                                three are French; one Prussian, and five are English. We have not
                                one American who can interpret, or who can be said to have any
                                knowledge of Chinese, and the few that we have in the offices as
                                clerks are very far indeed from being a superior class of men.</p>
                            <p>I should, therefore, consider it a very great favor if you could get
                                for me from America three young gentlemen, above 18 and under 22
                                years of age, who have received a collegiate education. I should
                                like men of at least fair average abilities, of good standing in
                                society, and of industrious habits. <hi rend="italic">£</hi>200
                                sterling (about $900, Mexican,) would be paid to each on his arrival
                                in China, to reimburse him for expenses incurred on his passage out.
                                For the first two years they would be located at Peking, to study
                                Chinese, where they would be provided with rooms, and receive pay at
                                the rate of <hi rend="italic">£</hi>400 (about $1,800) a year. At
                                the expiration of the second year the pay of each would be raised to
                                    <hi rend="italic">£</hi>600, (about $2,700,) from which it would
                                gradually, as vacancies occurred in the service, and as
                                opportunities for promotion allowed, rise to <hi rend="italic"
                                    >£</hi>800,<hi rend="italic">£</hi>1,000, and <hi rend="italic"
                                    >£</hi>1,200. In the course of time they might expect to become
                                commissioners, whose pay is at the rate of <hi rend="italic"
                                >£</hi>1,200, <hi rend="italic">£</hi>1,400, and <hi rend="italic"
                                    >£</hi>2,000 a year. An industrious, hard-working, and able man
                                might fairly expect to be a commissioner in eight or ten years.
                                After five years’ service, a year’s leave is granted on half pay. In
                                the event of the Chinese government desiring to dispense with any
                                one’s services, he would be entitled to either three months’ notice
                                or three months’ pay. After the second year in Peking, the inspector
                                general would locate each gentleman at the port he might consider
                                the most fitting.</p>
                            <p>If you can assist me in this matter, you will confer a favor on
                                myself and the customs services.</p>
                            <p>With much respect, very truly yours,</p>

                                great undertaking has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. Not
                                one of the ruthless rebels escaped.”</p>

                                this information immediately, assuring myself that, on hearing of

                                utmost pleasure, and encourages the hope that peace will soon be
                                restored throughout all the provinces of the empire, so that the

                                you stated that the rebellion in the southern States appeared to you
                                to place the United States in very much the same condition as China
                                was in, and I have now the pleasure to inform you that I have also
                                just heard of a great victory to the armies of the United States. I
                                can assure you that ever since my arrival in China I have been
                                greatly interested and anxious respecting her troubles from the
                                insurgents, and whenever peace has been fully restored in both our
                                countries we shall be able to congratulate each other with
                                reciprocal satisfaction.</p>

                                and the destruction or capture of all the chiefs of the rebels, from
                                which I perceive the agreeable feelings that the news brought by
                                this last courier from the south has given you.</p>
                            <p>The cheering accounts which you sent me have likewise given great and
                                sincere gratification. I am rejoiced to learn that the United States
                                forces have recently achieved a great victory in their attack on the
                                southern rebels, a sufficient proof their affairs are progressing
                                favorably. Both our countries will henceforth alike rejoice in
                                increasing prosperity and peace until restoration of order
                                everywhere prevails.</p>

                                my earnest and deep desire that such may be the case.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of the 3d of June, No. 78,
                            has been received. It contains an account of the trial, conviction, and
                            execution, at Shanghai, of John D. Buckley, an American citizen, upon a
                            charge of murder, and is accompanied by a copy of the legal proceedings
                            in that case in the court over which the consul general presided. These
                            papers having been submitted to the President, I have to inform you that
                            they are approved. Transactions of this nature in foreign countries are
                            exceedingly painful to the agents of the government, and hardly less so
                            to the President himself. It is, therefore, with special satisfaction
                            that we find in your despatch the reasons for believing that a marked
                            improvement in the conduct of such of our countrymen residing in China
                            as are viciously disposed has manifested itself, in consequence of the
                            promptness with which justice has been recently administered by the
                            consular court, with your enlightened approbation.</p>
                        <p>The extraordinary expenses incurred by the consulate in connexion with
                            these proceedings will be defrayed by this department.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Lieutenant Colonel Neale, her Britannic
                            Majesty’s charge d’affaires, has kindly given me a verbal account of the
                            result of his mission and of the operations of the British fleet at
                            Kagosima, though the preparation of despatches for his own government
                            has rendered it impossible for him to address me an official
                            communication.</p>
                        <p>On the 6th instant Vice-Admiral Kuper and his flag-ship Euryalus, the
                            steamships Pearl, Perseus, Argus, Coquette, Racehorse, and Havoc, left
                            this port for Kagosima, having on board Colonel Neale and the officers
                            of the British legation, and leaving in this harbor seven ships of his
                            fleet for the defence of this place.</p>
                        <p>On the 11th the fleet entered the bay of Kagosima, and with some
                            difficulty found anchorage, having in the evening reached a point near
                            the city. The water in the bay was found to be of extraordinary depth,
                            from 60 to 100 fathoms, except on a bank which was accidentally found in
                            the dark, and the ships anchored in 15 fathoms.</p>
                        <p>Early in the morning of the ensuing day some officers came on board and
                            made the usual inquiries: Who are you? Where are you from? Why do you
                            come here? How many guns have you? They severely censured a Japanese
                            pilot whom they saw on board, and were discourteous if not violent,
                            omitting to take off their long swords as is usual when entering the
                            cabin.</p>
                        <p>The ships immediately shifted their anchorage to a place within the range
                            of the batteries. The officers again came off and asked for a letter
                            which they understood was prepared for the Prince of Satsuma. This
                            letter demanded as an indemnity <hi rend="italic">£</hi>25,000 and the
                            punishment of the murderers of Mr. Richardson in the presence of a
                            British officer, which letter was given to them. In reply to the
                            question whether a Japanese steamer had arrived, they asked, Why should
                            one come here? To show you the way? Mr. Eusden, the interpreter, with
                            whom these several conversations were held, said: The Gorogio promised
                            to send a steamer for the purpose of acquainting the Prince of Satsuma
                            with the object of their coming. The officers whispered to each other
                            and remarked, “That beast at Yedo has been cheating us.”</p>
                        <p>Shortly after other officers came on board, and stating that Satsuma was
                            not at Kagosima, but at a castle fifty miles distant, said that his karo
                            or secretary would receive Colonel Neale on shore in a building prepared
                            for that purpose, and that he might come accompanied by as many of his
                            suite as he chose and with an escort. The karo was invited to a
                            conference on board the ship, which was the most proper, as he was the
                            inferior officer, and as both the minister and admiral would take part
                            in it. It was also urged that as the British minister had come so far
                            for the purpose of a settlement this course was the most suitable;
                            besides, the British were accustomed to see Japanese, but the people of
                            Satsuma were not accustomed to strangers. The officers retired to
                            present these views, and returned, still manifesting great anxiety that
                            the minister and admiral should go on shore, saying that the Dutch had
                            done so; the building was not far from the bay, and it was specially
                            prepared for business with foreigners. It was quite evident, Colonel
                            Neale thinks, that some sinister motive made them so urgent for his
                            presence on shore.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon an officer, represented to be the next in rank to the
                            karo, <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0466"/>approached the ship, and
                            asked whether Colonel Neale would see him, and whether he might bring
                            his attendants, some fifty in number, on board. When the attendants
                            reached the deck they were placed opposite the marines, drawn up in
                            line, and the chief officers conducted to the cabin. The principal
                            personage, for some reason, appeared speechless, and just as one of his
                            officers had declared he would act as spokesman, a servant entered with
                            a message, when it appeared he had been ordered to return, as some error
                            existed in the letter he was charged to deliver.</p>
                        <p>On his leaving the ship the squadron changed its anchorage to a point
                            less under the guns of the batteries. Late in the evening the officer
                            returned, and delivered a letter in reply to that sent by the British
                            minister. It commenced by declaring that murder was of course a serious
                            crime, and murderers should be punished; that they frequently escaped,
                            however, and it was difficult to arrest them; but that in this case it
                            was not certain that Satsuma was in fault; that it was the custom and
                            law of Japan to get out of the way and dismount before a great Daimio,
                            and if people did not they were beaten. Was not this also the usage in
                            England? That the Tycoon was to blame; he should have put such provision
                            in the treaties, and then no difficulty would have occurred; that as to
                            the indemnity, Satsuma would appoint a commissioner, and the Tycoon
                            might appoint another, who would investigate the subject, and then
                            Colonel Neale would see whether Satsuma or the Tycoon was to blame.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Neale, regarding this letter as evasive and otherwise
                            unsatisfactory, addressed a communication to the admiral, placing the
                            business in his hands. Early the next morning (a boat expedition having,
                            late on the previous evening, discovered their position) three
                            steamships, the England, Contest, and Sir George Gray, were seized by
                            order of the admiral, and brought to anchor near the British fleet. They
                            were intended to be held as pledges, with a view to further
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The weather at this time was very heavy, and at noon a typhoon was
                            evidently approaching. Shortly after the crews were piped to dinner, and
                            at once the batteries opened fire. The admiral immediately signalled,
                            “Burn the prizes.” The gale blew the British ships stern on, and their
                            guns could not be brought to bear, by springs on the cables, in
                            consequence of the great depth of water. For nearly half an hour the
                            ships were under fire before the anchors could be weighed. As soon as
                            this was effected, the ships steamed past the batteries, as delineated
                            on the plan of the harbor I enclose, the Euryalus taking the lead, and
                            returned slowly to their anchorage, delivering a close and steady fire
                            on town and batteries. The Racehorse grounded, and was with difficulty
                            hauled off by the Argus. In this engagement the Flag-Captain Joslin and
                            Commander Wilmot, of the Euryalus, brave, accomplished, and most
                            estimable officers, were killed, having their heads taken off by the
                            same cannon shot, and 56 officers and men on the different ships were
                            killed and wounded. Five out of the eight boats of the Euryalus were
                            destroyed, and all the vessels greatly suffered, particularly in their
                            rigging. At this time the storm was raging with great fury; the town had
                            been fired by the shells and rockets of the fleet, and the wind was
                            carrying the flames swiftly through the streets. A dreadful spectacle
                            was thus presented. The three steamers were on fire, as were also five
                            large Lewchew junks, to which the gunboat Havoc had separately applied
                            the torch, and the city, stretching away over three miles, was in
                            flames, which was also seen to envelop the green trees on the hillsides.
                            The foundry and machine shops, a mile in extent, were also on fire, and
                            the fury of the flames kept pace with that of the storm.</p>
                        <p>The next morning the fleet opened fire again on the town and batteries,
                            some of which feebly responded. Several shells were thrown into the
                            palace of Satsuma, which is believed to have been destroyed, as flames
                            were seen to issue from it as the fleet left.</p>
                        <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0467"/>
                        <p>It was thought that sufficient had been accomplished by way of
                            punishment, and that further proceedings would be regarded as
                            vindictive.</p>
                        <p>When the captured ships were destroyed, orders were given to land the
                            officers and crew who remained on board. The captain and doctor, one or
                            both of whom had been with the embassies to the United States and
                            Europe, begged they might be permitted to remain, as if landed they
                            would be obliged to commit hara-kiri, or would lose their heads. They
                            are now on the Euryalus.</p>
                        <p>The admiral arrived here on the 24th, after experiencing severe weather
                            the entire voyage. I was not able to meet the British chargé d’affaires
                            till last evening, and I have been engaged the entire day with some
                            governors for foreign affairs, sent from Yedo.</p>
                        <p>The mail, unexpectedly, closes at 10 o’clock to-morrow morning, and the
                            late hour forbids my saying more than that other governors will wait
                            upon me this week with a project for the amicable adjustment of our
                            difficulties with the Prince of Nagato, and that they entertained no
                            doubt it would be perfectly satisfactory, and render another visit of
                            the ships-of-war of the treaty powers unnecessary.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since my last despatch nothing of
                            importance has occurred affecting the relations of the treaty powers
                            with this government. The representatives of the former are waiting for
                            instructions, and the latter is as little as ever inclined to make known
                            its purposes.</p>
                        <p>I embrace every opportunity to assure this government of the friendship
                            of the President, and my own desire faithfully to represent his views. I
                            am satisfied that the government is in great perplexity, if not danger,
                            and I am <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0468"/>indisposed to make any
                            complaint, except when compelled to do so by the perversity or
                            insincerity of the governors of this place, with whom I have lately been
                            obliged to have frequent interviews.</p>
                        <p>I have been much perplexed to account for the great inconsistency of the
                            government in paying so large a sum to Great Britain at the very time it
                            gave notice of an intention to disregard the treaties, and that all
                            foreigners were required to leave the country.</p>
                        <p>After interchanging views with my colleagues, I have arrived at the only
                            conclusion which I think can satisfactorily clear up the mystery. It is,
                            of course, only a conjecture, but the best we can frame, and it may not
                            prove unprofitable or uninteresting to you if I give the explanation in
                            which the minister of France and myself concur, and in which our
                            colleague, Colonel Neale, to some extent unites.</p>
                        <p>You will remember that the Tycoon is chosen from the families of Kshii,
                            Owari, and Mito, though the latter family has never successfully
                            competed for the honor. At the last election the son of Prince Mito was
                            an unsuccessful candidate. The intrigues and violence which attended the
                            choice at that time culminated in the murder of the regent, and the
                            disgrace and death, it was then said, of Mito, who is now understood,
                            however, to be living, though having renounced his dignities and
                            possessions, and living, as is very common, as a priest, with shaven
                            head, &amp;c. Being a man of great ability, he is still thought to be
                            the adviser and director of his sons.</p>
                        <p>The Tycoon left Yedo for Kioto as the British fleet arrived and the
                            British demand was made. It is understood the determination of the
                            council at Kioto was averse to foreign trade and to compliance with the
                            British demands. We had official notice that the money would not be
                            paid, though I had been privately assured by Takemoto Hayato-no-kami,
                            one of the principal governors for foreign affairs, that it probably
                            would be paid.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile the Tycoon was detained at Kioto, and his departure from time
                            to time delayed by order of the Mikado, as we were also informed. Mito
                            was sent to Yedo as Vice-Tycoon, and to his brother, Stotsbasi, was
                            delegated the authority to expel foreigners. The latter arrived at this
                            place near the expiration of the time fixed by the admiral for the
                            commencement of measures of compulsion. An intrigue was in progress with
                            Ogasawara, the minister of foreign affairs remaining at Yedo, for
                            conferring the office of Tycoon on Mito, and it could not succeed if the
                            British fleet were bombarding Yedo. Under these circumstances Osano
                            Egano-kami, having charge of the custom-house and the public money at
                            Kanagawa, of which he was governor, and, being a protege of Ogasawara,
                            was ordered to pay and did pay the indemnity, while, at the same time,
                            Ogasawara gave the notices decided on at Kioto. It was ultimately found
                            that the conspirators could not control the council of Daimios remaining
                            at Yedo. Ogasawara was dismissed from office, as was also the governor
                            who paid the money. Stotsbasi was said to have committed hara-kiri, in
                            consequence of the discovery of a conspiracy to assassinate the Tycoon
                            on his return, but the better opinion is he is in disgrace, and confined
                            to his palace. Before this the regent Matsudaira Etsizen-no-kami,
                            understood to be unfriendly to the Tycoon, and suspected to be
                            implicated, had been dismissed.</p>
                        <p>Troops were sent forward from Yedo for the protection of the Tycoon, who
                            returned by sea instead of by land, in consequence of the discovery of
                            the designs of Stotsbasi, &amp;c. But it was not till after these events
                            had occurred that the Tycoon was able to obtain the requisite leave to
                            return, and, it is said, with the understanding that he is to carry out
                            the orders of the Mikado more faithfully than the agents first
                            commissioned.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that a grand council of Daimios is now in session at
                            Yedo, preparing the report which is to be given to the Mikado.</p>
                        <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0469"/>
                        <p>I give this as the only intelligible solution of the strange policy
                            pursued. It is probably as true as any which can be found.</p>
                        <p>While relations with this government remain unchanged, business is in a
                            very unsatisfactory condition. The export of silk last year reached over
                            25,000 bales, valued at $8,000,000. It was estimated it would this year
                            reach 3,500 bales, the increase of the preceding year having been about
                            7,000 bales. Though the export this year, up to this time, has equalled
                            that of last year to the same period, it has for several weeks come in
                            very slowly, in consequence of the interference, it is said, of a guild
                            at Yedo charged with its inspection. The government has disclaimed all
                            interference, and, I believe, with truth. If it were a mere combination
                            of the producers to obtain higher prices, no reasonable grounds of
                            complaint would exist, as such combinations are not unknown in more
                            civilized countries. It would be, in point of fact, merely a struggle
                            between capital and labor, in which the former would ultimately be sure
                            to be the victor. But it is understood that the producer as well as the
                            capitalist complains of the restriction, which is imposed rather in the
                            interest of the Japanese purchaser of silk and the native manufacturers
                            and sellers of manufactured goods.</p>
                        <p>The government has now promised that it will take measures to have it
                            sent forward more freely. Whether the government will be able to break
                            up a combination it declared itself powerless to prevent is very
                            uncertain. While it is confidently hoped the restrictions will be
                            removed, the government may contemplate their continuance, and declare
                            they are thus proved to be not properly subject to its control.</p>
                        <p>A more serious disturbance of trade arises from the hostile attitude
                            assumed by lawless retainers of Daimios, acting, probably, under the
                            protection and direction of their chiefs, towards the native merchant.
                            Failing in their attempts to intimidate the foreign merchant, they have,
                            accidentally or with great sagacity, struck a blow at trade in the only
                            direction where it can prove a vital injury. Two leading silk merchants
                            of Osacca have been assassinated by these lawless men, and a notice
                            daringly placed beneath their heads that they were put to death for
                            dealing with foreigners. This notice was signed as if by the order of
                            the Mikado. Other merchants have been driven from their houses. There
                            can be no doubt of the truth of the above reports, as they have been
                            obtained from agents of some of the parties here, and several houses at
                            this place have closed up their business in consequence thereof.</p>
                        <p>You will see I have made reference to a guild at Yedo. It is an
                            interesting fact, that here, where the counterpart of the feudal system
                            exists, also exists the counterpart of institutions which gave that
                            system its death-blow, at least in the low countries.</p>
                        <p>Merchants and others, of what may be called the middle or lower classes,
                            invariably seek protection from some Daimio, or are enrolled as members
                            of some guild or society; and these societies, whether of the
                            carpenters, or smiths, or gardeners, or coolies, are very clanish, and
                            an injury to one of the members is often expiated in the blood of the
                            aggressor. A fierce fight occurred here a short time since between
                            carpenters and coolies, and for a few days the bettoes (grooms of
                            horses) were triumphant, even over the local police, whose members they
                            beat and bound and otherwise maltreated.</p>
                        <p>I shall probably be able to advise you in a few days of the result of the
                            conference at Yedo.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                            another shocking murder.</p>
                        <p>This afternoon, at 2 o’clock, Lieutenant Camus, 3d battalion d’Afrique,
                            was riding on a pleasant road leading to the village of Kanagawa, and
                            when about two miles and a half distant from this place was attacked by
                            three two-sworded men, and most frightfully cut to pieces.</p>
                        <p>Intelligence of the wounding of a foreigner was given to all the consuls
                            by the governor of this place, and mounted men, of both the British and
                            French guard, were despatched to the spot. Our consul, Colonel Fisher,
                            attended by Mr. Banks, the acting United States marshal, and accompanied
                            by Dr. Jenkins, of the British consulate, under the guidance of Japanese
                            officers, reached the place nearly half an hour in advance of the
                            guard.</p>
                        <p>The body was found surrounded by numerous Japanese officials. The right
                            arm, with a portion of the bridle over it, was found several feet
                            distant from the body. The flesh of the left arm was sliced off to the
                            bone; another wound cut off the left side of the face, and passed down
                            through the left shoulder, leaving the arm attached to the body only by
                            a small portion of the flesh, reached clear to the region of the heart.
                            One wound severed the jugular vein; another, from the other side of the
                            neck, severed the spinal column. The face was so awfully disfigured as
                            scarcely to admit of recognition. These details I would gladly omit, but
                            you then could have no idea of the true character of these two-sworded
                            men.</p>
                        <p>The body was borne to the house of the minister of France, and when I
                            visited him I saw it. I hope I may be spared another such sight.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant Camus was entirely unarmed. He had remarked, shortly before
                            riding out, that he had found the Japanese always friendly; that he had
                            never been molested, and thought it unnecessary to carry any arms. It
                            appears quite certain that the rein was in his right hand, and that he
                            had no chance of defending himself, even had he been armed. He was an
                            officer of great promise, a friend of the family of Admiral Jauries, and
                            had been highly distinguished in the Italian campaign. Being unarmed,
                            and of an unusually amiable disposition, it is not possible he could
                            have given any provocation.</p>
                        <p>The mail has closed; but Colonel Neale having kindly offered to place
                            this despatch in the Foreign Office bag, I am enabled to send it by the
                            steamer which leaves to-morrow.</p>
                        <p>I this evening received a letter from the minister of foreign affairs,
                            asking me to delay my return to Yedo. I will send a copy of the letter
                            by the next mail, and ask your instructions.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                            1, the <hi rend="italic">compte rendu</hi> of a conference held at Yedo,
                            by the consul-general of the Netherlands and myself, with the Corogio,
                            and in pursuance of an invitation originally given to meet <pb n="451"
                                xml:id="pg_451" facs="0471"/>them at the governor’s residence at
                            this place, and afterwards at Yedo, on the ground that all the members
                            of the Gorogio desired to be present, and could not absent themselves at
                            the same time.</p>
                        <p>Copies of the same have been given to our colleagues.</p>
                        <p>I make no comment upon the extraordinary proposition now made. It is
                            regarded by my colleagues and myself as one threatening serious
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>It has long been apparent that nothing but the presence of a formidable
                            force can insure the safety of the foreign community, and it is quite
                            certain that, though individuals may be murdered, no attack will be made
                            so long as such force is at hand. In the absence of it, I think it can
                            scarcely be doubted that hostilities would ensue.</p>
                        <p>The British chargé d’affaires informs me the government of Great Britain
                            has directed the commander-in-chief of the forces in China to send
                            troops here, whenever requested by him.</p>
                        <p>A letter has been sent to me by the Gorogio, requesting another
                            conference on Saturday next, of which I enclose translation, No. 2; also
                            copies of the replies of the British representative and myself,
                            enclosures Nos. 3 and 4.</p>
                        <p>I shall transmit copies of the replies of the minister of France and
                            consul-general of the Netherlands as soon as received by me.</p>
                        <p>In consequence of placards affixed to the governor’s residence,
                            threatening with death some of the native merchants, several have
                            abandoned their business, and, in two instances, have demolished their
                            dwellings and stores, in proof of their sincerity.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient

                                    Gorogio, in the presence of the members of the second council,

                                1863.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese government being extremely desirous that the friendship
                                between the United States and Holland with Japan should not be
                                interrupted, has invited you, the representatives of these powers,
                                to this conference, for the purpose of making an important
                                communication.</p>
                            <p>This important communication will render many conferences necessary,
                                in order that you should hear all its reasons and fully be
                                acquainted with its views. And we, the Gorogio, have, therefore,
                                appointed two commissioners for this purpose, namely, Takemoto
                                Kai-no-kami and Ikido Siuri.</p>
                            <p>The unsettled state of things in our realm is increasing. We are
                                apparently approaching a revolution; there may be a general uprising
                                among the people who hate foreigners, and to our shame we must
                                confess that we have no power to suppress this insurrectionary
                                movement.</p>
                            <p>It is principally owing to the opening to trade of Yokohama that this
                                deplorable state of things exists.</p>
                            <p>If a continuance of trade at Yokohama be persisted in, the state of
                                affairs will grow worse. Trade will suffer, and no doubt disappear
                                in consequence, and then the friendship will be destroyed. It was to
                                establish friendly relations <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0472"
                                />that the treaties were made, as may be seen in the heading of each
                                of them. Friendship is the corner-stone; trade is subordinate to
                                friendship. We have always considered that the framers of the treaty
                                intended it as an experiment, to last as long as it would not prove
                                injurious to Japan. In order to perpetuate this friendship, it is of
                                the highest mutual interest that the port of Yokohama be closed to
                                trade, and, in our opinion, this is the only way to allay the
                                prevailing excitement.</p>
                            <p>We request you to inform your governments that the notification of
                                Ogasawara Dsulio-no-kami relating to the expulsion of foreigners
                                will be withdrawn, and to ask their consent to have the trade
                                transferred to Nagasaki and Hakodadi. We do not desire any further
                                alteration in the treaty.</p>
                            <p>A. M. and N. C. G. We regret that a proposition of such great
                                importance was not submitted at the same time to the ministers of
                                France and Great Britain, and we request you to give us the reasons
                                for this omission.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gorogio.</hi> It is our intention to ask the
                                ministers of France and Great Britain to confer with us on the
                                subject; but we desire you to come first, as we first made treaties
                                with America and Holland.</p>
                            <p>We request you meanwhile not to acquaint these ministers with the
                                subject-matter of the present conference, lest they should decline
                                to meet us.</p>
                            <p>A. M. and N. C G. This is very probable, for we would have saved
                                ourselves the trouble of coining to Yedo, if we had known of your
                                proposition. We are on the best terms with our colleagues, and I
                                shall not fail to acquaint them immediately on our return, this very
                                evening, if possible, with your views. Our governments would no
                                doubt reprimand us severely if we failed to do so.</p>
                            <p>We must observe here that we feel ourselves slighted by your
                                invitation to come to Yedo for no other purpose than to listen to
                                the very objectionable proposition you make; we are willing,
                                however, to overlook this, as we are sure it has been occasioned by
                                no want of politeness.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gorogio.</hi> We are very sorry that you look
                                upon it in that light. We intended to come to Yokohama, but the
                                importance of the subject in our opinion was such that we desired
                                all the members of the Gorogio to be present, and as we could not
                                all leave Yedo, we invited you to meet us here, and no slight was
                                intended.</p>
                            <p>A. M. and N. C. G. We feel convinced that the treaty powers will
                                never consent to the closing of Yokohama for the purposes of
                                trade.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gorogio.</hi> We greatly regret this, as the
                                friendly relations will then be in great danger. An unfortunate
                                accident recently occurred in the vicinity of Yokohama; this is
                                owing to the unsettled state of things in our empire. Similar
                                accidents may occur again, and if this general uneasiness continues,
                                or should increase, perhaps production may decrease; trade in all
                                probability would suffer then, or perhaps come to a standstill
                                altogether, and hence our apprehension for the existing friendly
                                relations.</p>
                            <p>Could not now the port of Yokohama be closed to trade by the foreign
                                representatives without first instruction from their respective
                                governments?</p>
                            <p>A. M. and N. C. G. Not a letter of the treaty can be altered by us.
                                We do not think any representative has the power to do so. We are in
                                Japan to see that the treaties be observed, and that our citizens
                                and subjects act in a proper manner. We must distinctly observe to
                                your excellencies that the treaties were never meant to be
                                experiments, but that it is explicitly stated that they were made to
                                perpetuate friendship and commerce between our respective
                                governments and their citizens and subjects.</p>
                            <p>We cannot agree to receive your plenipotentiaries, as it might be
                                construed that we had entered into negotiations with you on the
                                subject. We will confer with our colleagues, however, and jointly
                                decide whether we will have any further conference on the
                                subject.</p>
                            <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0473"/>
                            <p>It is impossible to abandon Yokohama. Heavy amounts have been
                                invested in building and warehouses, &amp;c., &amp;c. If we went to
                                Nagasaki and Hakodadi, we would be at too great a distance from the
                                central government, and interviews with the Gorogio would be
                                rendered impossible.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gorogio.</hi> We thought of this, and will
                                appoint plenipotentiaries to reside there, and to hold interviews
                                with the representatives. These plenipotentiaries will have power to
                                decide on all matters without reference to Yedo.</p>
                            <p>N. C. G. My government has already consented to an extension of the
                                opening of Osacca, Hiogo, &amp;c., and it may be expected that if it
                                make further concessions now, still more would be asked of it.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gorogio.</hi> Should the closing of Yokohama be
                                granted by the treaty powers, no further modifications of the treaty
                                would be required by us.</p>
                            <p>A. M. and N. C. G. We can give no better proofs of our friendship
                                towards the Japanese than by frankly advising your government to
                                dismiss all idea of having Yokohama closed, but to apply itself
                                diligently in favor of a rigid main tenance and faithful execution
                                of all articles of the treaties.</p>
                            <p>The abandonment of Yokohama would only serve to encourage the
                                reactionary party, and more alteration would be constantly demanded
                                from your government.</p>
                            <p>A. M. I call your attention to the fact that the American government
                                has not yet formally consented to postpone the opening of Osacca,
                                Hiogo, &amp;c. I now wish to say that I informed my government last
                                year that I thought it best to give such consent, but now I am
                                satisfied it was a mistake for the treaty powers to make any such
                                concession; it has only encouraged the hostile party to make now
                                more demands.</p>
                            <p>A. M. and N. C. G. We perfectly agree in considering the application
                                of the Japanese government for the postponement of the opening of
                                Osacca, &amp;c., as a mistake, the revolutionary party having been
                                encouraged thereby to ask now for the closing of Yokohama.</p>
                            <p>As long as the Japanese government fails to resist this revolutionary
                                party, it will have no peace. We are under the impression that it
                                would be far better for the Japanese government, if it has no power
                                to suppress these revolutionary tendencies, to apply for aid (as
                                last February it intimated that it might do) to the treaty
                                powers.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gorogio. To</hi> call in the aid of the treaty
                                powers is not according to Japanese laws and customs, and would have
                                the most disastrous results.</p>
                            <p>We received strict orders from the Tycoon to negotiate about the
                                closing of Yokohama, and, therefore, respectfully urge upon you to
                                receive our plenipotentiaries, to confer with them, and to be made
                                acquainted with all the circumstances.</p>
                            <p>A. M. and N. C. G. We request your excellencies distinctly to
                                understand that we shall not enter into negotiations on the subject;
                                the most we could do would be to listen to your views in order to
                                fully transmit them to our respective governments.</p>
                            <p>A. M. I wish to say that your ancient usages cannot be alleged and
                                accepted as an excuse for a failure to comply with your treaty
                                obligations, nor for your exemption from the application of the
                                principles of international law. These usages must give way whenever
                                they come in conflict with your new obligations.</p>
                            <p>N. C. G. What has been done by the Japanese government towards
                                punishing the Prince of Nagato, who, in such a cowardly and
                                treacherous manner, fired from his batteries upon a Netherland
                                man-of-war, and other foreign ships at Simonoseki?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gorogio.</hi> An arrangement is now being made
                                with the Prince of Nagato.</p>
                            <p>N. C. G. Why was he not promptly punished?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gorogio.</hi> It is the custom in Japan to act
                                with deliberation in such matters.</p>
                            <p>N. C. G. It is to be regretted that prompt action was not taken in
                                this matter, as my government may now be inclined to think that the
                                Japanese government has not disapproved of the acts of the Prince of
                                Nagato. I have only further <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0474"
                                />to observe that an old Dutch proverb says, that soft surgeons are
                                apt to make hard wounds.</p>
                            <p>A. M. I am instructed by the President of the United States, in a
                                conciliatory manner, and as a proof of friendship, to caution the
                                government of the Tycoon that any aggression on any of the treaty
                                powers will be likely to lead to your being involved in difficulties
                                with all. I wish also to say for myself that, much as revolutions
                                are to be deprecated and avoided, there are worse things than
                                attempts at revolution which may be put down. A government must have
                                more than a name. It must have and exercise authority, and cause
                                itself to be respected.</p>
                            <p>The Prince of Nagato has seized one of your ships, and has attempted
                                to seize the person of the Mikado. If the Tycoon should seize his
                                province bordering on the Straits of Simonoseki, and make it
                                imperial territory, no Daimio would in future defy his
                                authority.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gorogio.</hi> This we could not do; we do not
                                know he has made such attempts on the Mikado.</p>
                            <p>A. M. Why, then, has Nagato been expelled from Kioto?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gorogio.</hi> We believe because the Mikado does
                                not like him.</p>
                            <p>The Gorogio then urged again that we should not mention to our
                                colleagues what had taken place, as the government wished them to
                                come to Yedo to receive the communication.</p>
                            <p>We peremptorily declined compliance with such request, repeating that
                                we had come to Yedo in ignorance of the communication to be made;
                                but should we now suffer our colleagues to come under similar
                                circumstances, they would have great cause of complaint against
                                us.</p>
                            <p>On taking leave we were asked what we thought of the Satsuma matter—
                                whether it was right or wrong; and replied that we had no opinion to
                                offer.</p>

                                with your excellency and the Netherlands consul-general, we have to
                                say that we desire further to confer on that subject with you, in

                                and the Netherlands consul-general, and request you, therefore, to
                                come to Tskitshi, at the Gunkang Sorenjo, (navy yard, Yedo,) on the
                                19th day, at 9 o’clock, (the 31st of October, at noon.) Should you

                                day for that purpose.</p>
                            <p>And as there is much apprehension lest an accident happen, as was
                                recently represented to you, we request you to come by water. We
                                trust that after consultation with your colleagues you will be able
                                to meet us.</p>

                                letter inviting me to proceed to Yedo to hold an interview with your
                                excellencies on the 31st instant, upon a subject regarding which you
                                wish to enter on a discussion with me.</p>
                            <p>My colleagues, the minister of the United States and the
                                consul-general of the Netherlands, have informed me that in like
                                manner you invited them, two days ago, to repair to Yedo to confer
                                with you on an important matter, which you did not specify; and that
                                upon their arrival at Yedo the purport of your communication
                                amounted to the total subversion of treaty rights.</p>
                            <p>Without further entering into the particulars of your communication,
                                and of which my colleagues have informed me, I have to state to your
                                excellencies that, as the representative of her Majesty the Queen of
                                Great Britain and Ireland, I decline to respond to your invitation
                                of repairing to Yedo for the purpose of discussing any such
                                unheard-of communication, or to receive any envoys charged with
                                similar communications.</p>
                            <p>The utmost measures I will adopt, under the circumstances, is to
                                report to my government what you may communicate to me in writing,
                                and in becoming terms. I have, therefore, to engage your
                                excellencies to state to me by letter, explicitly and categorically,
                                what the government of the Tycoon proposes, and wishes me to convey
                                to her Britannic Majesty’s government; and it only remains for me to
                                add that, inspired on my part, as the representative of Great
                                Britain, with no hostile feelings nor designs against this country,
                                I trust that the government of the Tycoon will duly weigh and
                                consider the sense and probable consequences which it may desire me
                                to make known to the powerful nation I have the honor to
                                represent.</p>
                            <p>It is also my duty to add that, pending the reference of any such
                                unusual and extraordinary communication (made to me in writing) to
                                her Britannic Majesty’s government, should hostile or aggressive
                                acts be committed by the government of the Tycoon, or by any Daimio,
                                against the relations of amity and commerce established by treaty
                                made and duly ratified by Great Britain and Japan, such will be
                                resented by corresponding acts of retaliation by her Majesty’s
                                forces, in defence of the national honor, and of the treaty rights I
                                am placed here to maintain and protect.</p>

                            <p>To the <hi rend="smallcaps">Gorogio:</hi></p>
                            <p>I have to say, in reply to your excellencies’ letter, that I feel
                                constrained to decline another interview, to listen to further
                                propositions in reference to the abandonment of Yokohama, which I
                                presume is the object of the proposed conference on Saturday next.
                                Nor should I have met you on Monday, had I known the nature of the
                                communication you wished to make on that occasion.</p>
                            <p>I can only say, as I did at that interview, that if your excellencies
                                wish any proposition to be made to my government, it is
                                indispensable it shall be made in <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456"
                                    facs="0476"/>writing. I will promptly transmit a copy to the
                                President, but repeat that I can give you no hope whatever of
                                success. It has become perfectly evident that every concession, thus
                                far granted, has been made the basis of a new demand. I therefore
                                renew the advice I then gave you. Let it be at once proclaimed that
                                his Majesty the Tycoon will faithfully observe the existing treaties
                                and require his subjects to do the same. Peace in Japan will be
                                secured by such an exhibition of good faith and vigor. A contrary
                                course invites to a resistance of the authority of the Tycoon. It
                                holds out expectations which will never be realized, while it
                                encourages a defiance of his authority which may subject him to the
                                twofold danger of a civil war and of serious difficulties with all
                                the treaty powers.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that the
                            Gorogio on the 9th instant sent to me three governors for foreign
                            affairs, to induce me to persuade my colleagues to visit Yedo, to hear
                            the reasons which induce them to desire the closing of this port.</p>
                        <p>I took advantage of this visit to say that I had great cause of
                            complaint, because, while the government invariably sought my assistance
                            when in difficulty, it had not even acknowledged the receipt of letters
                            giving advice, which they had subsequently by their action admitted to
                            be friendly and wise.</p>
                        <p>I had urged them in two different letters to withdraw the letter of
                            Ogasawara, and the Gorogio had not even shown me the courtesy to
                            acknowledge their receipt. Yet their present proposal to negotiate for
                            the closing of one port was a practical acknowledgment that the
                            government were guilty of a grievous error in announcing its settled
                            determination to close all the ports. They said it had been intended to
                            make that letter the basis for further negotiations. To this I replied,
                            that nothing had been left for negotiation, but a determination to close
                            the ports had been announced as the settled policy and purpose of the
                            government.</p>
                        <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0477"/>
                        <p>I then remarked I had informed the government that the treaty powers had
                            a right to regard that letter as equivalent to a declaration of war, and
                            that it was extremely important, therefore, that the letter should at
                            once be withdrawn; that it would be too late to do so after expenses had
                            been incurred by the treaty powers in consequence of its receipt; and
                            though it might be too late to withdraw it now, and escape that danger,
                            it would be extremely hazardous to defer it longer.</p>
                        <p>I have the pleasure to enclose No. 1, copy of a letter addressed to me,
                            as the result of that interview, and No. 2, copy of my reply.</p>

                            <p>I have received your excellencies’ letter in relation to the
                                withdrawal of the letter of Ogasawara with much satisfaction, and I
                                thank your excellency for having promptly followed the advice I gave
                                you a few days since.</p>
                            <p>Your excellencies will recollect that I have written several letters
                                urging this step, and while I regret that you have not acted
                                earlier, I hope the delay will not prove prejudicial. I presume you
                                do not wish to have the letter delivered to you, but to have it
                                considered as withdrawn.</p>
                            <p>To this I assent, and will send you the letter itself if desired.</p>
                            <p>With respect and esteem,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that at the
                            interview referred to in my despatch No. 74, of the 13th instant, I
                            requested the governors for foreign affairs to call the attention of the
                            ministers to the immediate settlement of the damages sustained by the
                            owners of the Pembroke. I also notified them, that if any proposition
                            was to be made for the settlement of the outrages upon our citizens at
                            this place, it should be made without further delay, as I should
                            otherwise refer the whole matter to my government. I stated distinctly,
                            I made no demands for the insult to our flag in firing on the Pembroke,
                            nor on the Wyoming before any provocation was given, as I wished to
                            leave that for the decision of the President, but that I would be
                            prepared to receive any propositions which the government might be
                            disposed to make.</p>
                        <p>I have now the satisfaction to inform you that, on the 27th instant, the
                            same governors waited on me, and informed me that they had been
                            instructed by the Tycoon’s government to say, that it had fully
                            considered the case of the Pembroke, and arrived at the conclusion that
                            the claim was just and reasonable, and that the bill of damages
                            presented by Messrs. Russell &amp; Co. should be paid; but that the
                            government wished the time of payment delayed till the public feeling
                            had became more tranquil.</p>
                        <p>I asked the governors whether they were prepared to name any time when
                            the money would be paid. Ever since I have been in Japan the government
                            has felt obliged to plead the state of public feeling as an excuse for
                            avoiding or delaying action, and I saw no prospect of a change. While I
                            thanked the government of the Tycoon very gratefully and sincerely for
                            the friendship it had shown to myself personally, and especially to the
                            government of the United States, I could not see how I could with
                            propriety, or indeed with honor, accept of an excuse for delaying the
                            payment to citizens of the United States of so small a sum, at the very
                            time one of so much greater magnitude was to be paid to Great
                            Britain.</p>
                        <p>The governors dwelt strongly upon the difference between the two cases.
                            In the case of the British demands the delay had occurred in admitting
                            them at all. In this case the government at once conceded the propriety
                            of paying <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0479"/>the amount, and only
                            wished to delay the time of payment. Though the amount to be paid was
                            small, the hostile Daimios, who were watching the government closely,
                            would be as much offended as if a large amount were paid. The amount
                            would not be so much considered as the payment of any indemnity
                            whatever. As I had always been friendly, they wished me to consider well
                            the whole subject, and agree to a delay.</p>
                        <p>I replied, I was very anxious to do all in my power to show my friendly
                            feelings and that of my government, but the promise was too indefinite
                            and vague. If I should apply for payment in a month, or in a year, or
                            even two years, and the government still urge the same difficulty, I
                            could interpose no objection to further delay if I admitted the excuse
                            now. That it would give me great pleasure to report to the President the
                            expressions of friendship they had been instructed to make, which would
                            be received by him with great satisfaction, and would communicate their
                            offer; but unless payment was actually made there could be no final
                            settlement, and I must be at liberty to decline receiving the amount
                            when tendered, if, meanwhile, instructions should arrive which should
                            oblige me to do so. They then said they would report what I had said,
                            and the government would reconsider the subject.</p>
                        <p>I then reminded the governors of what I had said about the insult to our
                            flag, stating that I did not wish to demand any money indemnity, though
                            I wished the Daimio punished; that if the government were disposed to
                            offer a sum which would provide annuities for the families of the dead
                            and for the wounded of the Wyoming, I would, for the purpose of giving
                            further proof of friendship and moderation, take the responsibility of
                            settling the entire case on such basis; but I made no specific demands,
                            preferring, unless some offer was made, to await instructions.</p>
                        <p>The governors said that the government had been disposed to regard that
                            offence as fairly offset by the punishment inflicted. The Wyoming had
                            been fired on, and had promptly returned the fire; they had no
                            instructions in reference to that part of the case, though they had well
                            Understood and represented the distinction I had made between the
                            private damage and the national insult.</p>
                        <p>They continued to urge me to agree to a delay in the payment of the
                            indemnity to Messrs. Russell &amp; Co., saying that the government did
                            not wish to delay the time until the public feeling of Japan was more
                            quieted, but until the government had settled with Nagato.</p>
                        <p>I replied, the period might be too remote; that the prince had seized
                            their steamer, and their ambassadors from whom they had not heard, and
                            there appeared, therefore, little prospect of a settlement in that
                            quarter. They then informed me that the steamer had returned to Yedo. I
                            then asked whether Satsuma had sent forces against Nagato. They said
                            that he was not fighting against him in his territories, but the report
                            had probably arisen from the fact that he had despatched forces to Kioto
                            to assist in driving Nagato from that city, when he was engaged in
                            hostilities against the Mikado. The governors left me with the promise
                            to return after having received further instructions.</p>
                        <p>I shall, after having disposed of the case of the Pembroke, urge a
                            settlement of the cases which have arisen at this port. The interview in
                            question was too protracted to admit of it.</p>
                        <p>It is quite certain that Nagato, after having successfully resisted the
                            three Daimios sent to chastise him, will be obliged te yield to the
                            formidable force now arrayed against him. The governors said he had
                            retired from Kokura, a city south of the straits, and is now within his
                            own territories.</p>
                        <p>I have urged that the north side of the straits should be made imperial
                            territory, and that is the basis of a settlement I should advise. This
                            will punish Nagato by weakening his power, and at the same time make the
                            Tycoon responsible for the free navigation of the straits.</p>
                        <p>The President will see, in this offer of the government, additional and
                                <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0480"/>conclusive proof that in
                            sending the Wyoming to Simonoseki, hostilities were not commenced
                            against the Tycoon, but only against a rebel to his authority, as well
                            as one I rightfully regarded as an outlaw.</p>
                        <p>Satsuma has not yet paid the British demand; but I suppose it will be
                            paid, as I cannot see what motive he could have in making a promise he
                            had no intention to carry out.</p>
                        <p>I had supposed the proposition to close Kanagawa was only made for the
                            purpose of quieting the hostile Daimios; but there has been strange
                            persistence in pressing for other interviews for the purpose of urging
                            the abandonment of this port.</p>
                        <p>In other respects no unfavorable change has occurred. My relations with
                            the government are very friendly and pleasant.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obedient

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith Nos.
                            1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, my correspondence with the ministers on the
                            subject of my return to Yedo, which I have been anxious to effect. While
                            my residence there would place me in more intimate relations with the
                            government, it would almost isolate me, and put me at great disadvantage
                            in my intercourse with my colleagues, with whom, at this juncture,
                            frequent conferences are desirable. I had determined, however, to return
                            until the receipt of the last letters of the Gorogio. Merchants at Yedo,
                            who might be supposed to have a small interest in my return to that
                            city, unite in representing it as the scene of great disorders and much
                            bloodshed.</p>
                        <p>While I think that the ministers were very anxious, on political grounds,
                            in view of the assemblage at Kioto and the conference with the Mikado,
                            to cause me to leave Yedo, and while recent events satisfy me more fully
                            that some of their partisans, at least, were privy to the destruction of
                            the legation buildings, I now believe that anxiety for my safety is the
                            real and principal, if not the only cause why the government prefer I
                            shall not return.</p>
                        <p>I should be pleased to have your views for my guidance, though I may have
                            decided on returning before they arrive.</p>

                                important letters which I have addressed to your excellencies remain
                                unanswered.</p>

                            <p>I shall visit Yedo next week for the purpose of holding an interview
                                with your excellencies, and wish you to fix the day when it will be
                                convenient to receive me, and to inform me of it immediately.</p>
                            <p>I am forced to insist on this, as the governors for foreign affairs,
                                who recently visited the French minister, failed to <ref
                                    target="http://ca.ll">call</ref> on me, and thus deprived me of
                                an opportunity of communicating with your excellencies.</p>
                            <p>I am now daily expecting a vessel with furniture from Shanghai, and
                                as on its arrival I shall be prepared to resume my residence in
                                Yedo, I wish to be informed whether any place of residence is
                                prepared for me.</p>
                            <p>I have, at this place, so little opportunity of communicating with
                                the government, and your excellencies are so remiss in answering my
                                letters, as to make it my duty to hasten my return to Yedo.</p>

                            <p>As I left Yedo at the request of the government of his Majesty the
                                Tycoon, I think it proper to ask of your excellencies an assurance
                                that the dangers which alarmed the government have passed by, and
                                that the government is able to extend the requisite protection to
                                the legation.</p>
                            <p>I do not ask this because of any fear which I have, but because I
                                think such assurance is due to my government. As I informed the
                                President of the United States of the message you caused to be
                                delivered at the time I left Yedo, I wish to send to him your formal
                                declaration of the improved condition of that city.</p>
                            <p>I propose still to rely entirely on a guard to be furnished by the
                                government of his Majesty the Tycoon, and on receiving a letter from
                                your excellencies I shall be prepared, on the arrival of my
                                furniture, to resume my residence in Yedo.</p>

                            <p>You certainly will not doubt that officers will be sent (though you
                                did not ask it) to your legation for protection, and that we will
                                use our best efforts in this respect as far as lies in our
                                power.</p>

                                prevention of accidents, no opportunity has yet presented itself for
                                the suppression of the unsettled state of affairs, which gives us
                                much uneasiness; hence it is impossible to give you the assurance
                                you desire.</p>
                            <p>We request you, therefore, to postpone for some time longer your
                                return to this city, and to remain in Yokohama for the present,
                                which we have to state in reply.</p>

                                the protection of the legation, and I am exceedingly anxious to
                                resume my residence there.</p>
                            <p>Considerations of public duty influence my mind, and to these are
                                superadded those of personal convenience. When I left Yedo I was
                                unable to secure a residence here, and when I found one that would
                                answer I was unable to obtain any furniture. Now that my furniture
                                is on its way from Shanghai, and daily expected, I cannot hire a
                                dwelling. The only suitable one I can get will not be ready for me
                                till February. I will, therefore, thank your excellencies to send a
                                governor for foreign affairs to this place, so that I may obtain
                                such needful information as may enable me to decide what is the
                                proper course for me to pursue; and I desire that he may be fully
                                informed, also, of your wishes and intentions as to the conclusion
                                of the treaty, which are not sufficiently disclosed in the letter I
                                received this day.</p>
                            <p>If he is at the same time authorized to close all open questions now
                                pending, it may serve to render an interview with your excellencies
                                unnecessary.</p>

                            <p>Ogasawara Setto-no-kami having recently held an interview with your
                                excellency upon various matters, under our instructions, you spoke
                                to him on that occasion about your return to that city, which he
                                communicated to us, and which we fully understood. Many persons
                                congregate in this city, and there are many rough and bad ones
                                amongst them. We believe that you did already take into due
                                consideration that we are in great anxiety on this subject; and
                                recently an accident took place in the vicinity of Yokohama. Taking
                                all things together, we prefer that you should not reside in this
                                city at present, and, greatly to our regret, we have to request you
                                to remain some time longer at Yokohama, and to await our further
                                considerations on the subject.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Last evening Takemoto Kai-no-kami, senior
                            governor, and five other governors for foreign affairs, waited on me.
                            They were directed by the government to say, as I had stated to the
                            ministers when at Yedo, though refusing to enter into any negotiations
                            for closing this port, that I would transmit any communications in
                            reference thereto which they might send me for the consideration of my
                            government; the ministers proposed sending a letter, but a personal
                            explanation might be necessary. They were instructed to ask what
                            reception would be given to an embassy in Europe and in the United
                            States. To this I replied, I was not prepared to say what reception
                            would be given to one in Europe, but that I could say, without
                            hesitation, that an embassy would be kindly received in the United
                            States; and that any representations it might be instructed to make
                            would be listened to patiently, and carefully considered, <pb n="464"
                                xml:id="pg_464" facs="0484"/>though I could hold out no hope of
                            success. They said that if an embassy should be sent, they begged most
                            earnestly that no such expensive reception should be given to it as on
                            the occasion of the former one. I was then asked, as Russia had no
                            minister here, whether, if it were decided to send such embassies, I
                            would consent to be the medium of communication with that government.
                            They preferred this, rather than request the friendly services of my
                            colleagues. I replied, that in view of the uninterrupted and firm
                            friendship which had signalized the relations of the United States and
                            Russia, I would willingly transmit any communication they wished to
                            make, as I had no doubt it would be agreeable to my government, and not
                            unacceptable to his Majesty the Emperor of Russia. I then asked whether
                            they had conferred with my colleagues on the subject, and was informed
                            they had not; that the government would now consider the subject, and,
                            as soon as they had arrived at a decision, would confer with my
                            colleagues. The governors then said, as I was so much engaged, they
                            would take their leave, though they had other business which they would
                            postpone for a few days. When they solicited the interview, the message
                            brought to me was, that it was the governor of Kanagawa who wished to be
                            received; and I had replied, that, unless his business was pressing, I
                            wished it postponed for two days, as I was preparing despatches for my
                            government, and also for the immediate return home of my son, Robert C.
                            Pruyn, who has been attached to the legation for nearly two years. I
                            then stated that I had hoped, when I heard of their arrival from Yedo,
                            it was for the purpose of fixing an early day for the payment of the sum
                            agreed to be paid to the owners of the Pembroke. The senior governor
                            answered he had been absent from the castle for several days, but his
                            colleagues informed him that the government were now reconsidering the
                            subject, and would communicate the result in a few days. It is
                            impossible to say whether there is any serious intention of sending such
                            embassies. It may be that wishing to gain time, and finding it
                            impossible to entangle my colleagues and myself in the meshes of an
                            endless and useless negotiation, it is regarded as the most available
                            alternative. It may be, also, that there are some influential officers
                            who covet the honor, and, perhaps, more eagerly the safety, of an
                            honorable exile at this time. While it may be impossible to refuse a
                            post connected with foreign affairs, disgrace, death, or an equivocal
                            and doubtful promotion await all upon whom the unwelcome mantle falls.
                            Every minister and governor for foreign affairs, save one, who was in
                            office at the time of my arrival, has disappeared from the stage. Death,
                            fines, imprisonment have been the acknowledged fate of some; unheard-of
                            offices and posts, which remove from all contact with foreigners, the
                            declared rewards of others. The present senior governor is the only one
                            who has outlived all changes. One prediction I can make with safety. If
                            any embassy is sent, Takemoto Kai-no-kami, senior governor for foreign
                            affairs, will be the chief. It is very unsafe, however, to make any
                            predictions in this country. The players are unseen, and only occasional
                            glimpses of a portion of the political chessboard can be obtained. The
                            chance discovery of the position of a few of the pieces furnishes the
                            only data for conjecturing the position of others, which may, perhaps,
                            control the result.</p>

                            1, translation of a letter from the minister for foreign affairs,
                            informing me of the total destruction by fire of the palace of his
                            Majesty the Tycoon, at Yedo, on the 25th ultimo. These buildings had
                            only been finished shortly before my arrival, the old palace having been
                            destroyed by fire in 1859. Rumor says the destruction was the work of
                            Stotsbasi, one of the imperial family, and that powder was used in
                            effecting it. While, the information that the Tycoon had escaped is
                            rather strange language in reference to a fire which commenced as early
                            as 6 o’clock in the evening, and gives some color to the rumor, the
                            better opinion is that the fire was accidental. It is said to have
                            originated in the women’s apartments, and that the Tycoon’s principal
                            concubine, who was the accidental agent in the affair, has committed
                            hara-kiri, (suicide.)</p>

                        <p>Agreeably to instructions contained in your letter No. 46, I have
                            addressed a letter to this government, of which I enclose a copy,
                            enclosure No. 1. The letter is so full as to render any explanatory
                            remarks unnecessary.</p>
                        <p>I prepared my letter in advance of the receipt of yours, as both the
                            ministers of France and England had received copies which you had
                            furnished, not wishing that my instructions and purpose should be made
                            known in advance of my action.</p>
                        <p>I have received a letter from the minister of foreign affairs, informing
                            me that, at the time the palace of the Tycoon was destroyed, my letter
                            was burned, and requesting a duplicate, which was sent in. This will
                            delay somewhat their answer. I have no means of saying what it will be,
                            but I cannot believe that demands so just, and at the same time so
                            moderate, will not be promptly adjusted.</p>

                            <p>Having received instructions from the President of the United States
                                to make certain demands of the government of his Majesty the Tycoon,
                                for indemnities for losses occasioned by the destruction by fire of
                                the buildings of the United States legation at Yedo, and for
                                outrages committed on citizens of the United States at this place, I
                                invite the attention of your excellencies to a review of the facts
                                on which such demands are based.</p>
                            <p>Nearly one year ago, when it had been resolved that his Majesty the
                                Tycoon should visit Kioto, I was urged by the government to withdraw
                                from Yedo till his return; and the efforts to this effect were never
                                relaxed until crowned with success, one week after the destruction
                                of the buildings occupied by the legation in that city. Scarcely an
                                interview took place with a governor of foreign affairs when the
                                inducements to such a determination were not held out. It was
                                represented that my comfort would be thus promoted, and that it
                                would be more pleasant for me to be with my colleagues, and free to
                                enjoy the pleasures of society; This was forcibly contrasted with my
                                solitary life in Yedo. It was also represented that Yedo was less
                                secure as a place of residence, while his <pb n="467"
                                    xml:id="pg_467" facs="0487"/>Majesty the Tycoon was absent. It
                                was even offered, that, as my expenses would be greatly increased by
                                the necessity of keeping up an additional establishment at Yokohama,
                                the Japanese government would pay every expense which might be
                                thereby incurred. In the month of April his Majesty the Tycoon
                                commenced his journey. On the 23d day of May I had an interview with
                                Takemoto Hayato-no-kami which lasted nearly the entire day. At that
                                time I reiterated my refusal to withdraw from Yedo, but announced my
                                purpose to go to Kanagawa and remain there two weeks. About 6
                                o’clock p. m. the governor left the legation; at 2 o’clock the next
                                morning all the buildings were burned to the ground.</p>
                            <p>In the preceding February Takemoto Kai-no-kami and Takemoto
                                Hayato-no-kami paid me a visit, to confer respecting the surrender
                                of Goten Yama, as a site for the legation building, and left me at
                                about 6 o’clock that evening; and it is a remarkable coincidence,
                                that the British legation was levelled to the ground by fire at 2
                                o’clock of the succeeding morning. This was conceded to be the work
                                of an incendiary; but the fire which destroyed the United States
                                legation buildings is claimed to have been the result of an
                                accident. The fire originated at the most distant point of my
                                chamber, and if the work of incendiaries, was thus far considerate
                                and kind; but it was at a place where no fires had been used for
                                hours, and the government has never been able to account for it,
                                though the officers and servants have been subjected to some kind of
                                examination, and though the legation was at the time sorrounded by
                                about five hundred guards.</p>
                            <p>About 9 o’clock that morning a small house outside the line of guards
                                was placed at my disposal; this consisted of three rooms, two of
                                which were occupied by your officers and guards, and the remaining
                                one by myself and two gentlemen of the legation. Here we remained
                                one week, until Sunday evening, the 31st of May, sleeping on the
                                mats, and having ample opportunity to prove that on an emergency our
                                actual wants are few and easily supplied.</p>
                            <p>It appeared to have been taken for granted that we would depart at
                                once from Yedo, as it was announced to me that our horses had been
                                saddled for that purpose by direction of some officer; but I at once
                                declared that I would not do so until some provision should be made
                                for the rebuilding of the legation, or for placing at my disposal
                                some equally commodious residence. I was finally told by Takemoto
                                Hayato-no-kami that the government had taken the subject into
                                consideration, and was apprehensive if it commenced to rebuild the
                                house it would be burned down again; but that money would be given
                                to the priest in charge of the temple, who would rebuild it with
                                impunity, as the object would not then be known or suspected.</p>
                            <p>What reason had the government to suppose the buildings would again
                                be destroyed or the work interrupted? Clearly none, if it really
                                believed that the fire of May 24 was the result of an accident; but
                                if satisfied that it was the work of persons hostile to the presence
                                of any foreigners in Yedo, and determined to drive them out, then
                                the fear was justified and the decision wise. When it was at length
                                agreed that the government would immediately fit up the temple which
                                had escaped the flames for my residence, I prepared to leave for
                                Kanagawa, and reside there till the work was done.</p>
                            <p>About noon on the 31st of May Matsudaira Iuami-no-kami, governor for
                                foreign affairs, made his appearance. He said he had come to see me
                                at some personal risk, and that he was commissioned by the
                                government to inform me that it was in possession of proof of a
                                conspiracy to attack the legation that very night; that about 500
                                Lronins were assembled for that purpose; that directions had been
                                given to certain Daimios to surround the place of the assemblage;
                                that the government was apprehensive they might take the alarm and
                                disperse; that if arrested some might escape, and, exasperated by
                                the loss of their comrades, still make the attack; but if all were
                                captured, as it was hoped they would be, the government would be
                                embarrassed in punishing them, as some of the friends <pb n="468"
                                    xml:id="pg_468" facs="0488"/></p>
                            <p>of the Lronins might seek revenge on members of the legation. It was
                                further represented that if I were away from Yedo the government
                                would feel at liberty to punish them with unsparing severity, which
                                it proposed to do, as the Lronins had become so bold as to bid
                                defiance to the government.</p>
                            <p>I was thereupon asked (as my residence was ill defended, and entirely
                                without the line of guard-houses) to go on board a Japanese war
                                steamer, and in her to Yokohama. As it was my purpose, as announced
                                to the government, to leave Yedo the next day, I, of course, had no
                                suspicion that this was a contrivance to hasten my departure; and at
                                5 o’clock p. m. I left the legation, accompanied by some hundreds of
                                Yakunins, and went on board your gunboat.</p>
                            <p>Early in June the government was able to announce to the Mikado, the
                                Tycoon, and the assembled Daimios, at Kioto, that no foreigner was
                                in Yedo.</p>
                            <p>What punishment was inflicted by the government on the Lronins for
                                this threatened outrage, for this flagrant violation of
                                international law and of treaties which guarantee to every legation
                                a safe residence in Yedo? I had every reason to believe that the
                                government would act with vigor. It had surrounded these ferocious
                                men with a large force, and had declared that their punishment would
                                be so severe as to make it unsafe to inflict it until the peaceful
                                objects of their vengeance were in safety at a distant place.</p>
                            <p>In a few days these lawless men are gently, and with almost parental
                                care, gathered together in commodious quarters, placed under the
                                supervision of a governor, taken into the employ of the government,
                                and pacified by liberal salaries.</p>
                            <p>When this startling and almost incredible fact came to my knowledge,
                                my vigorous remonstrances were met by the remark, made with the
                                utmost placidity of countenance, That all Lronins were not bad men,
                                but that there were some good men among them, and that it would not
                                do to punish these men!</p>
                            <p>The President of the United States has, after full consideration of
                                the facts submitted to him, come to the conclusion that they raise a
                                strong presumption that the act of firing the residence of the
                                legation was committed by incendiaries, with a purpose at once
                                political and hostile to the United States, and that the government
                                of Japan could probably have foreseen and prevented it, and that
                                they have at least given a tacit assent and acquiescence.</p>
                            <p>The President arrived at this conclusion before the receipt of my
                                letter informing him of the extraordinary demands made by the
                                government of his Majesty the Tycoon at a subsequent period, and his
                                convictions will be greatly strengthened when he considers the
                                daring declaration of its purpose to close all the ports, and that
                                foreigners were required to withdraw from Japan; and, also, the
                                extraordinary request, now pending, that the treaty powers shall
                                abandon this port.</p>
                            <p>It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the government of his
                                Majesty the Tycoon urged my withdrawal from Yedo, because it was
                                aware of the existence of a party hostile to my residing there, and
                                because it was apprehensive for my safety. It is also evident that
                                the government, instead of insisting that the subjects of his
                                Majesty the Tycoon should submit to the treaties, desired to
                                conciliate the hostile Daimios, by rendering the treaties
                                practically void so far as they guarantee a safe residence in that
                                city. It was for this reason the suggestion was made, that Yedo
                                would be less safe during the absence of his Majesty the Tycoon,
                                while, to my mind, directly the reverse was the fact. The assemblage
                                of many Daimios at Kioto, and the withdrawal of so many of their
                                retainers from Yedo, appeared to me to constitute a great element of
                                safety.</p>
                            <p>The conference of Kioto is, of course, enveloped in mystery. The veil
                                which covers its proceedings will probably never be lifted. Only one
                                of its measures has thus far been disclosed by the government. The
                                Mikado has ordered the ports to be closed and foreigners to be
                                expelled. The influence which was <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469"
                                    facs="0489"/>sufficiently potent to procure such a decision was
                                not to be disregarded by his Majesty the Tycoon or his ministers. My
                                retirement from Yedo was a measure which would propitiate it.</p>
                            <p>But while the government was laboring to secure this result by
                                persuasion, it is evident there were some parties who were not
                                inclined to wait its slow movements. The same hostile parties which
                                have so persistently and violently opposed the treaties and sought
                                to set them aside, and which have threatened alternately the
                                government of Japan and the treaty powers, determined to resort to
                                violence. Goten-Yama had been rescued from the foreign legation by
                                the torch of the incendiary, and the buildings of the United States
                                legation shared the same fate. When this did not effect my
                                departure, threats of violence and assassination were resorted to;
                                and if the parties who made these threats were not rewarded by the
                                government for making them, it is very clear that they did not
                                thereby forfeit its confidence. History presents no parallel to such
                                a spectacle! By the common judgment of mankind the government will
                                be held justly liable to the charge of granting favors to persons
                                whom it had pronounced premeditated assassins, and declared it to be
                                their purpose to visit them with the signal punishment they had so
                                justly merited.</p>
                            <p>Nor must I omit to remind your excellencies how much time elapsed
                                before the temporary building agreed on was prepared for the
                                legation; that you even now declare it can only be occupied at the
                                peril of our lives, and that no steps have been taken towards
                                rebuilding the premises which were destroyed.</p>
                            <p>The President has instructed me to demand of the Japanese government
                                a sum which shall be sufficient to indemnify the legation for all
                                losses sustained by that fire.</p>
                            <p>I therefore demand the payment to me of the sum of $10,000, for the
                                public and private property injured and destroyed at that time.</p>
                            <p>I am also instructed to demand that diligent efforts be made to
                                discover the incendiaries and bring them to condign punishment;
                                also, that adequate guarantees be given for my safe return to Yedo,
                                and the permanent establishment of the legation there without delay.
                                In making these demands, I must insist on the immediate rebuilding
                                of my late residence.</p>
                            <p>I am also instructed to insist on the full observance of the treaties
                                between the United States and Japan in all the particulars which
                                have not heretofore been waived or postponed by the government of
                                the United States.</p>
                            <p>But I am instructed to make demands for further indemnities.</p>
                            <p>When the government of his majesty the Tycoon appeared to be on the
                                eve of a rupture with that of Great Britain, it issued a
                                notification which produced a panic in the native population of
                                Yokohama, and occasioned the flight of merchants, workmen, and
                                servants. The government stated to me that its purpose had been
                                misunderstood; that it had been thought advisable to recommend the
                                removal of the sick, of the aged and the infirm, and of women and
                                children, and that its humane recommendation to this effect had
                                frightened the other residents and led to their flight. Whatever may
                                have been the language employed, its effect was almost to depopulate
                                the place. Nor was it surprising that those who had sums justly due
                                them should desire to realize them before they left, as they thought
                                they might never return, or, if they did, find that their debtors
                                had been expelled. The populace, therefore, was greatly excited, and
                                for a season there was much reason to fear that the place would be
                                under the control of infuriated men who could not be restrained, and
                                would perpetrate acts of violence and be guilty even of murder. It
                                is a significant fact that the governor did not make his appearance
                                until the afternoon of that day, although his usual hour of
                                attendance at his office was 10 o’clock a. m., nor was the slightest
                                attempt made to pacify or put down the rioters. It was not till
                                after the consuls of the treaty powers had sent for him, and
                                indignantly remonstrated at his <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470"
                                    facs="0490"/>indifference, that his voice was heard. The
                                disturbance was at once hushed, and the ease with which he restored
                                order was so great as to induce the belief that his absence was the
                                result of premeditation and of a deliberate purpose to allow full
                                license to the mob.</p>
                            <p>While the government was thus culpably indifferent, if not guilty of
                                complicity in the violent proceedings, workmen and coolies collected
                                at different places in great numbers to collect the debts actually
                                due, or to extort payment of pretended ones. I shall only notice the
                                three prominent cases to which I have already called the attention
                                of the government.</p>
                            <p>A band of men, headed by a merchant, proceeded to the house of Samuel
                                Robertson, an American merchant, took him forcibly from the house
                                and carried him towards the swamp or creek lying back of Yokohama.
                                Some of these men were armed with fire-hooks and with the jagged
                                irons used in arresting criminals, with which they pushed and
                                otherwise maltreated him. There can be little doubt that his life
                                would have been sacrificed had not the British guard met and rescued
                                him. The outrage was aggravated by the fact that Mr. Robertson had
                                been confined to his house for some time by illness.</p>
                            <p>A band of coolies went to the house of J. O. P. Stearns, also an
                                American merchant, seized him and beat him till he was insensible.
                                He was rescued from them when unable to move, by his servants, to
                                whose devotion and courage he is indebted for his life.</p>
                            <p>Another body entered the house of Mr. Raphael Schoyer, an American
                                merchant, and demanded money from him which was not due. They forced
                                themselves into the presence of his wife, and the contractor, who
                                had meanwhile arrived, carred off three hundred itsebus from his
                                table. The presence of his wife, and the fears he felt for her
                                safety, and that it might lead to other outrages and bloodshed,
                                induced Mr. Schoyer to refrain from resisting them.</p>
                            <p>If the gentlemen named had been indebted to these men and unjustly
                                refused payment, such violent measures cannot be justified. The
                                officers of the United States have always promptly investigated
                                every claim presented against an American citizen. The government on
                                one occasion paid a debt of over $2,000 which had been incurred by
                                an American citizen who absconded. Nor will the Japanese government
                                ever have any just cause of complaint against officers of the United
                                States government for any failure to observe faithfully every treaty
                                stipulation. But while citizens of the United States will ever be
                                required to meet every obligation they have incurred to the extent
                                of their entire property, they have a right to expect, and will
                                receive from their own government, protection of life, person, and
                                property, and its full power will be exerted, when needful, to
                                secure their rights.</p>
                            <p>I cannot believe that debts are collected from subjects of his
                                Majesty the Tycoon, under process of law, by means of fish hooks and
                                yokes ornamented with projecting nails; but if so, we have a right
                                to ask that such persuasive instrumentalities be reserved for their
                                exclusive use.</p>
                            <p>Since these occurrences, I have repeatedly requested the governor of
                                Kanagawa to present any claims which Japanese have against American
                                citizens for investigation in the consular court. Every one which
                                has been made has been promptly examined and settled, so far as I
                                have heard, to the satisfaction of your officers.</p>
                            <p>None has been presented against Mr. Robertson, nor is he justly
                                indebted to his assailants. The claim against him arises under a
                                contract, which has not been fulfilled by the Japanese merchant,
                                owing to a rise in the price of the article to be delivered. The
                                amount of eighty dollars, retained on the contract for security for
                                its fulfilment, is entirely insufficient to pay Mr. Robertson the
                                amount of loss he has sustained.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Stearns employed a coolie to fill in his lot for a sum agreed on.
                                After some progress had been made in the work Mr. Stearns made a new
                                contract, <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0491"/>increasing the
                                price on the representation of the contractor that he would suffer
                                loss, and on this representation being repeated, Mr. Stearns again
                                increased the contract price.</p>
                            <p>The work, which was to be done in a few days, occupied weeks, and
                                though Mr. Stearns was dissatisfied, he requested the contractor to
                                call for the amount due the very day he was assaulted. The party who
                                made the attack at Mr. Schoyer’s was not in his employ, but a
                                sub-contractor of the Japanese workman employed by him; nor was any
                                sum due from Mr. Schoyer to any person whatever for that work.</p>
                            <p>On my calling the attention of the government to these cases,
                                Takemoto Hayato-no-kami assured me they would be examined and the
                                parties punished. He also requested me to delay sending the
                                affidavits to my government in order that I might have the
                                satisfaction, when making known the wrongs sustained, of informing
                                the President that those wrongs had been promptly redressed.</p>
                            <p>The governor of Kanagawa was thereupon called on to investigate the
                                affair and report. The first report he made was that they had been
                                settled; and then he had the audacity to say that the outrage on Mr.
                                Robertson was only a practical joke. He then attempted to shield the
                                offenders by saying they were carrying Mr. Robertson to the
                                custom-house for the purpose of collecting their debt. This was not
                                true, as they were carrying him in a direction nearly opposite. But
                                if true, and they had taken him there without subjecting him to
                                indignity and ill usage, the custom-house officials had no
                                jurisdiction. The United States consular court was the only tribunal
                                which could pass upon the question of indebtedness. But this is a
                                mere pretence. The affidavit of Mr. Thomas Eskrigge, a British
                                merchant, discloses the fact that this merchant was seen by him on
                                two different occasions prowling about the residence of Mr.
                                Robertson, and that he threatened to renew his attack.</p>
                            <p>Although I have repeatedly called the attention of the government to
                                these injuries, and to the threats that others would be attempted,
                                nothing has been done to punish the offenders. They are at liberty
                                to this day. The governor of Kanagawa promised our consul that they
                                should be kept in confinement till the cases were fully
                                investigated. But, again, the singular spectacle is presented of
                                rewards being conferred instead of punishment. The person who made
                                the assault on Mr. Stearns is now in charge of the work which the
                                government has in progress of making drains and sewers in this town.
                                Such criminal indifference to the safety of citizens who have come
                                here relying on the pledged faith of the Japanese government greatly
                                aggravates the wrongs which they have suffered.</p>
                            <p>I therefore demand the payment to me of $20,000 in satisfaction of
                                injuries to citizens of the United States sustained at the period
                                above referred to. I further demand, agreeably to instructions, that
                                you make diligent efforts to bring the aggressors to justice, and to
                                inflict upon them such punishment as will be calculated to prevent
                                further outrages of the same kind.</p>
                            <p>A few months ago a Japanese whaler, under the command of Manjiro,
                                returned from the Bonin islands, bringing several seamen who desired
                                to leave, and two citizens of the United States charged with
                                offences. One of these was found guilty by our consul, and sentenced
                                to be confined in prison for the term of four months, and was
                                confined in your prison the full term.</p>
                            <p>The other, George Horton, is an old man charged with no offence, but
                                coming off to the ship in a boat in which a pistol was found. The
                                consul, with the consent of Captain Manjiro, at once discharged him
                                from arrest. He is a poor, trembling, paralytic old man of
                                eighty-five years of age. He was left at the Bonin islands by
                                Commodore Perry, in the year 1854, and has resided there ever since,
                                supporting himself by the cultivation of a small piece of land. I
                                have asked your excellencies to send him back in one of your ships.
                                You have <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0492"/>answered that he
                                was taken away because it was dangerous to leave him there. I have
                                seen him, and will not waste time in further reply than I have
                                heretofore made to this charge. His land is there, and all he
                                possesses. The government of the United States is now paying for his
                                support at this place. I regard his expulsion as entirely
                                unwarranted; but if it was essential to the peaceful possession of
                                these islands, and such possession be finally acquiesced in by the
                                government of the United States, it is manifestly proper that you
                                should pay for the property you have taken from him. If, therefore,
                                you do not send him back I demand the payment of the sum of $2,000
                                to me as an indemnity for his use.</p>
                            <p>The above aggregate sum of $32,000 must be paid within thirty days
                                from this date, or I shall be at liberty to make such additional
                                demands as may be required by further instructions or by the course
                                of events.</p>
                            <p>I am instructed to employ the naval force of the United States at
                                command for the protection of myself, the legation, and others of my
                                countrymen, under any circumstances which may occur. And I am
                                directed to inform the government of his Majesty the Tycoon that the
                                United States will, as they shall find occasion, send additional
                                force to maintain the foregoing demands.</p>
                            <p>The President of the United States is disposed, notwithstanding the
                                government of Japan has done so much, and suffered so much to be
                                done to alienate and injure the United States, to persevere in the
                                friendly and liberal course of proceedings which it has hitherto
                                pursued. But the friendship of the United States cannot be secured
                                by the government and people of Japan, nor could it be of any avail
                                if the United States should fail to maintain their own dignity and
                                self-respect in their intercourse with Japan in the same frankness
                                which they practice in regard to all nations.</p>
                            <p>With the expression of the hope that the government of his Majesty
                                the Tycoon will see the justice of these claims, and avert the
                                consequences which will inevitably follow their rejection,</p>
                            <p>I remain, with respect and esteem,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It has been determined to send the embassy
                            to Europe, of which I informed you in my despatch, No. 80, of the 1st
                            ultimo, but I have not yet been advised whether it has been finally
                            decided to send any to the United States. I presume that question is in
                            abeyance in consequence of the demands I have made, and of which it may
                            be thought best first to dispose.</p>
                        <p>Mr. de Bellecourt, the minister plenipotentiary of France, having been
                            recalled, at his own request, expects to leave here next month. He has
                            encouraged the sending of this embassy, as he will be in France when it
                            arrives, and Admiral Jones has represented that an autograph letter of
                            his Majesty the Tycoon, <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0493"
                            />expressing sorrow for the murder of Lieutenant Camus, will tend to the
                            amicable adjustment of that affair. A mission which will have the
                            appearance of being sent specially to deprecate the anger of France will
                            doubtless be imposing, and gratify the minister and the government.</p>
                        <p>But while that matter may incidentally be disposed of, the object and
                            sole object of the mission is to solicit the consent of the treaty
                            powers to the closing of this port. Of this you have already been
                            advised as it was first disclosed to me.</p>
                        <p>On the 4th instant two vice-ministers waited upon Lieutenant Colonel
                            Neale, her Britannic Majesty’s chargé d’affaires, to make known the
                            purposes of the government.</p>
                        <p>The vice-ministers, after saying that the government had so decided, said
                            that the governors for foreign affairs, who were present, would make
                            known the reasons which had influenced the government, and that they had
                            nothing more to communicate.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Neale asked why it had been thought necessary for them to come
                            down from Yedo to make that bare announcement, and then leave the
                            principal business to be disposed of by governors.</p>
                        <p>The vice-ministers replied the governors were better acquainted with the
                            subject. Colonel Neale said he would hear what the governors had to say,
                            but would write it down as coming from the vice-ministers, as it would
                            be said in their presence.</p>
                        <p>The governors then said Colonel Neale was aware of the great hostility
                            there was in the country to foreigners, to which he replied he was not
                            aware of any such thing, but thought the people were friendly. One of
                            the vice-ministers then said it was necessary to close Kanagawa. Colonel
                            Neale said he would listen to no such remarks.</p>
                        <p>The governors then asked Colonel Neale to aid them in their mission by
                            explaining the difficulties they labored under. He said he knew nothing
                            of their difficulties, and could say nothing to aid them; that he had
                            nothing to say one way or the other; they had a right to send a mission
                            whenever and wherever they pleased; but while it was gone he would watch
                            affairs closely, and every mail a letter would follow their embassy
                            explanatory of affairs here. That he held war in the one hand and peace
                            in the other for them to choose; that he would watch the progress of
                            trade; if it was stopped, he would stop their trade; if they stopped
                            supplies to foreigners, he would stop their supplies. They asked whether
                            he meant he would stop imports. He said no; he meant he would stop their
                            home trade between their different ports.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Neale then asked why so many stores were closed at this place.
                            One of the governors rather pertly said “perhaps it is because the
                            people cannot afford to keep them open.” This remark he severely
                            rebuked. Colonel Neale says the interview lasted four hours, and was far
                            from satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>The above is a brief account of it given to me by Colonel Neale.</p>
                        <p>The embassy is expected to leave here so as to embark from Shanghai in a
                            steamer of the French line, the Messageries Imperiales, on February the
                            20th.</p>
                        <p>Although the French minister has insisted upon its being composed of men
                            of higher rank than of former missions, it is quite certain the material
                            of which it will be composed will be of the same comparatively low rank,
                            as heretofore.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that J. G.
                            Walsh, esq., our consul at Nagasaki, having heard that J. D. Buckley,
                            charged with the murder at Shanghai of Captain MacKinnon, of the Emily
                            Banning, an American citizen, and for whose apprehension a reward of
                            5,000 taels had been offered by the United States consul at Shanghai,
                            was at the port of Nagasaki, a passenger for Havre in the French ship
                            Jeanne and Joseph, under the name of Rayley, applied to the French
                            consul for permission to effect his arrest.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dury, the French consul, instituted an inquiry, and satisfied himself
                            that the man was Buckley, but declined to surrender him, or permit his
                            arrest, without the permission of the French minister, for which he
                            applied; meanwhile arresting the man and placing him in the French
                            prison, and suffering the ship to leave without her passenger.</p>
                        <p>On the receipt of Mr. Walsh’s letter I immediately waited on the French
                            minister, who came to the conclusion he had no authority to give up
                            Buckley. I had no copy of our treaty with France for the surrender of
                            fugitives from justice, but the French book of Consular Instructions
                            evidently contemplates a demand by government, and a surrender by the
                            Emperor on the report of the minister of justice.</p>
                        <p>The French minister was very willing I should get the man, but was
                            unwilling to assume any responsibility. He disapproved of the consul’s
                            proceedings in making the arrest, as he was guilty of no crime against
                            French law, and was willing to direct his discharge. If the United
                            States authorities should make no arrest, he was also willing to send
                            him to France to be surrendered there on the proper application. Against
                            this I urged the delay and the dispersion of witnesses, &amp;c.,
                            &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Finally, learning that there were no French ships at Nagasaki, and having
                            arranged that Mr. Walsh should be apprised of the time of Buckley’s
                            discharge from the French prison, I directed him to arrest Buckley at
                            all hazards, and to employ the necessary guard for his safe-keeping, and
                            his delivery to George F. Seward, esq., United States consul at
                            Shanghai, and hope that such measures will be taken as will prevent his
                            escape.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to inform you that Captain Sir Roderick Dew, of her
                            Britannic Majesty’s steamship Encounter, who took my letter to our
                            consul, kindly said he would take the prisoner when arrested, and such
                            guard as might be necessary, to Shanghai, to which port he was bound,
                            after touching at Nagasaki.</p>
                        <p>I shall advise you of the result when I receive the report of our consul,
                            in order that if the person shall be arrested, and taken by the
                            Encounter to that port, the proper acknowledgments may be made in
                            requital of Captain Dew’s courtesy.</p>
                        <p>I invite your attention also to the probability that many similar cases
                            will arise in these distant ports as the frequency of intercourse
                            increases, and crimes, as it is very likely, will multiply, so that, if
                            the President shall think further treaties necessary, provision may be
                            made for the surrender of a fugitive by a minister on the application of
                            the minister of the power of which the fugitive is a subject or citizen,
                            without reference to or action by the home government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I regret to have to inform you that the
                            Japanese government has declined to pay the indemnities I have been
                            instructed to demand. I enclose, No. 1, a copy of translation of the
                            letter of the minister, which, you see, does not attempt to deny or even
                            explain the facts set forth in my letter, which, I think, fully
                            establish the liability of the Japanese government.</p>
                        <p>The chief object in the proposed transfer of the negotiations to
                            Washington is probably to gain time, as the embassy is first to visit
                            all the treaty powers in Europe. It may be hoped, likewise, that if it
                            finally yields to these claims, the Japanese government may secure the
                            coveted closing of this port.</p>
                        <p>I enclose, No. 2, a copy of my reply. I do not yet despair of an amicable
                                <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0496"/>and satisfactory
                            settlement, though I am without a national vessel, and nothing has been
                            accomplished here as yet by any nation in the absence of force, or the
                            prospect of its immediate presence.</p>
                        <p>Additional proof of this will soon be given. Baron de Rehfus has been
                            here since the month of September, vainly urging the exchange of
                            ratifications of the Prussian treaty. He has now gone to Yedo, and has
                            landed a large guard of marines and sailors from the corvette Gazelle,
                            and announced his determination to remain in that city till the exchange
                            of ratifications shall have been effected, and I have no doubt he will
                            now succeed.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient
                            servant,</p>

                            <p>We received your letter No. 136, dated the 21st December, and
                                understood all that you stated therein. In the first place, in
                                regard to what has been said about the fire at Dzenfkujee, it has
                                been not only stated to your excellency on that occasion in writing,
                                but the circumstances have also been fully and clearly explained by
                                governors for foreign affairs, under our instructions; hence, you
                                must have understood them well; we therefore thought that you would
                                clearly explain this to your government, and would have received
                                instructions accordingly. Your communication surprised us
                                greatly.</p>
                            <p>The treaty of peace and amity having been concluded, good faith must
                                be mutually shown as a matter of course; but your suspicion that the
                                fire was caused by secret instigation of criminals would be an
                                extraordinary indignity for our government. If our government,
                                because the public feeling in our country is mostly unsettled,
                                desired, in the conciliation of that public feeling, to put an end
                                to the intercourse with foreign powers, there would be a different
                                action; if such were the case, the engagement entered into of peace
                                and amity would go for naught, and all the care we have hitherto
                                taken would have been in vain; wherefore, we are in great anxiety.
                                That, without taking this into consideration, you should have made
                                us the said communication, is very disagreeable to us.</p>
                            <p>If now we were to give the money for indemnity, according to your
                                demand, it would then be taken for granted that your suspicion was
                                correct and founded on reality. There could be no greater disgrace
                                for our government than to do this; it is, therefore, absolutely
                                impossible to comply with your demand, however much you might, urge
                                us. If, however, owing to the strict orders which you received from
                                your government, you should not be able to settle this on your own
                                responsibility, we will then, through our embassy about to be sent
                                to your country, fully confer with your government on the subject.
                                As regards the temple as the temporary residence of the minister at
                                Yedo, we have already given orders to the proper persons, wherefore
                                the building of it will be proceeded with.</p>
                            <p>And as regards the Yokohama matter, we instructed the governor of
                                Kanagawa to investigate the real circumstances thereof, wherefore we
                                will shortly give your excellency a definite answer when it is
                                entirely arranged; but on the occasion of the excitement among the
                                residents of Yokohama last summer, many mistakes among them,
                                originating in trifling causes, occurred, and unlawful acts were
                                probably not committed by the Japanese only, and the <pb n="477"
                                    xml:id="pg_477" facs="0497"/>forcible urging, by Japanese, of
                                their claim on your countryman, must have been caused by his
                                improper refusal of the same. In regard to the matter, however, we
                                shall, after full examination, address ourselves, in further reply,
                                to your excellency.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, upon the matter of the resident of the Ogasawara Sima,
                                (Bonin islands,) we already had a correspondence, but the real
                                circumstances of the case have not yet become perfectly evident; we
                                propose, therefore, through the proper person, fully to confer with
                                your excellency on that subject.</p>
                            <p>We regret that we cannot comply with your demand as stated in the
                                said letter; but as we find ourselves compelled, for the reason
                                already given, to state the foregoing to your excellency, it is
                                desirable that you will not take it in evil part.</p>
                            <p>As your letter on the occasion of the destruction, by fire of the
                                castle was destroyed, and there have been many things to attend to,
                                we fear that the expiration of the time proposed has been caused
                                thereby, which we have to state, in preliminary reply, to your
                                letter.</p>
                            <p>With respect and esteem.</p>

                        <p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your excellencies’ letter
                            declining to pay the indemnities I have demanded pursuant to the
                            instructions of the President of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I cannot refrain from the expression of my surprise, as well as regret,
                            that you should, without any consultation with the undersigned, thus
                            have closed the door to their amicable adjustment. Nor is the ground on
                            which such refusal is based tenable. No nation is subjected to indignity
                            or disgrace when it acts justly; and it is difficult to reconcile such
                            sensitiveness in the present case with your payment of the indemnity for
                            the murder of the guards at the British legation. Such payment does not
                            necessarily involve the idea, in either case, of the complicity of the
                            government in these lamentable occurrences.</p>
                        <p>I had transmitted to the President copies of the testimony taken by order
                            of your excellencies, and of the explanations made by your government.
                            What you term my suspicions must, therefore, be regarded as the
                            deliberate convictions of the President of the United States in view of
                            that testimony and those explanations, and of the public and regretable
                            events which have, within the past year, occurred in Japan, and the
                            action of the government connected therewith and consequent thereon. As
                            the decision of the President has been made after due deliberation, it
                            will not be modified or abandoned.</p>
                        <p>It is my duty, also, to say to you that the President of the United
                            States has confided to me the settlement of these questions, and that
                            diplomatic usage does not sanction your proposed summary transfer of the
                            negotiations to Washington, even if grave objections did not exist
                            thereto independent of such usage, growing out of the great delay which
                            would thereby be occasioned.</p>
                        <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0498"/>
                        <p>I advise your excellencies to send no embassy to the United States until
                            the relations of the two governments shall assume a more satisfactory
                            position than that in which your excellencies’ letter has placed
                            them.</p>
                        <p>It is also my duty to say to you that, should your excellencies,
                            notwithstanding this advice, send your embassy to the United States,
                            after having disposed of its business in Europe, it will have no
                            influence in delaying such measures as I shall be instructed to
                            institute to enforce these demands. Nor shall I await these instructions
                            if events in Japan shall render the use of force necessary for the
                            maintenance of the national dignity and of the rights of our citizens;
                            but I shall consider it my duty, under the full powers I now possess, to
                            use, in any such case, the force now in the Chinese waters and such
                            additional force as may arrive in advance of further instructions.</p>
                        <p>The government of the United States has carefully observed every treaty
                            stipulation, and has abstained from every act which would have a
                            tendency to impair the friendly relations which have hitherto existed
                            between the two governments. The President, therefore, had reason to
                            believe that his demands would be met in the friendly spirit with which
                            they were made; and that his abstaining from sending a strong naval
                            force simultaneously with their presentation would be appreciated by the
                            government of his Majesty the Tycoon. Such course would have redounded
                            to the honor of Japan, as well as secured its true interests by
                            demonstrating that the government of his Majesty the Tycoon was prepared
                            to do justice without the necessity of resorting to coercive measures,
                            or even threatening them. An additional proof is afforded by your
                            present refusal that the foreign powers cannot expect justice to their
                            citizens and subjects, nor any weight to attach to the representations
                            of their ministers, unless they shall keep in the ports of Japan a
                            permanent and strong naval force.</p>
                        <p>I must also remind your excellencies that the government of the United
                            States has not yet given its consent to the postponement of the opening
                            of the city of Osacca and the ports of Hiogo and Nee-e-gata to foreign
                            trade and residence, and that now it will be fully justified in
                            withholding such consent altogether, and in notifying the treaty powers
                            that it regards such city and ports as now open under its treaty with
                            Japan.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the satisfaction to inform you that
                            J. D. Buckley, charged with the murder, at Shanghai, of Captain
                            Mackinnon, surrendered himself to our consul at Nagasaki, and has been
                            sent to Shanghai in her Britannic Majesty’s steamer Encounter, in charge
                            of an officer despatched by the consul for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>The measures adopted, referred to in my letter No. 4, of the 6th instant,
                            resulted as I hoped. I was the more solicitous of success because I had
                                <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0499"/>learned that Buckley was a
                            fugitive from justice from California, charged with shooting a man in
                            the streets of San Francisco, and that the unprovoked attack on Captain
                            Mackinnon grew out of the utterance by the deceased of Union sentiments.
                            Of all this you have been, no doubt, informed by the United States
                            consul at Shanghai,</p>
                        <p>It is my agreeable duty to call your attention to the considerate
                            courtesy of Captain Roderick Dew, of the Encounter, who detained his
                            ship, as Consul Walsh informs me, several hours, to enable him to secure
                            the prisoner.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose you No. 1,
                            translation of a letter of the minister for foreign affairs approving of
                            the convention made with this government, and No. 2, translation of a
                            letter from the same making further reduction of duties. The articles
                            named in the last letter were embraced in the general term “articles de
                            Paris,” and would have been inserted in my convention, but I thought it
                            proper to omit them as an act of courtesy to Mr. de Bellecourt, who had
                            originally proposed such reduction to me, as he is about leaving his
                            post of minister plenipotentiary here to assume that of consul-general
                            at Tunis; having, it is understood, failed to receive the support or
                            meet the approval of his government. I should also have been willing to
                            omit spirituous liquors from the articles admitted at the duty of five
                            instead of thirty-five per cent., had I not supposed he would then have
                            failed to secure such reduction, and thus have subjected myself to the
                            charge of want of friendship for France. It may be well, also, to say
                            that such liquors are purchased exclusively by the foreign residents in
                            Japan. The same change of policy which has induced this government to
                            conclude this convention wish myself after such a long delay has enabled
                            the envoy of the Swiss confederation to succeed in his mission, and also
                            the envoy of Prussia to exchange the ratifications of the treaty with
                            his government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose No. 1, a copy
                            of the agreement for the extension of the time of opening the new ports
                            and cities to trade and residence, which is of the same duration as that
                            granted by the other treaty powers.</p>
                        <p>On my arrival in Japan no action had been taken by the treaty powers in
                            reference to the application of the Japanese government for such
                            extension. Mr. Harris was unable to act when first authorized, because
                            some of his colleagues, in concert with whom he was empowered to grant
                            such extension, had recommended their respective governments to refuse
                            their assent. In the month of February, 1862, Sir Rutherford Alcock
                            addressed a letter to Mr. Harris, informing him that he was ready to
                            confer with him on the subject, but Mr. Harris replied that he was in
                            daily expectation of my arrival, and he wished to leave me to act free
                            from any embarrassment which might arise from his discussion of the
                            subject. Shortly after the Japanese left for Europe, and the subject was
                            again referred back to the home government by the ministers of the
                            several European powers.</p>
                        <p>On the occasion of my first interview with the Gorogio, the subject was
                            introduced, and Mr. Harris informed the ministers he had given me his
                            views, and the government would find me very friendly, and disposed to
                            do all that was proper.</p>
                        <p>From that time till December no application for such consent was made by
                            the Japanese government, nor was the subject referred to, though
                            meanwhile I had been empowered to act independently of my
                            colleagues.</p>
                        <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0503"/>
                        <p>Early in December I addressed a letter to the ministers, in which I
                            proposed certain modifications of the treaty, reducing duties and
                            establishing bonded warehouses. I also informed the ministers I had
                            received a letter from American merchants residing in Yokohama, asking
                            what arrangements had been made for the accommodation of foreigners at
                            Hiogo and Osacca, when those cities should be opened the ensuing month.
                            No reply was given or notice taken of either of those letters.</p>
                        <p>A few days before the 1st of January, 1863, I had an interview with
                            Sinano-no-kami, governor of foreign affairs, in which, after expressing
                            a wish that all unfinished business should be disposed of before New
                            Year’s day, I referred, among other subjects unacted on, to these
                            letters, and expressed my surprise that they had received no notice. He
                            at once replied: We do not intend to open the port of Hioga and city of
                            Osacca. I thanked him for the information, but said I was under the
                            impression that I had something to say on that subject. He said no, Mr.
                            Harris has given the consent of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I then said the Japanese government certainly labored under a mistake;
                            that Mr. Harris had informed me he had not given such consent, nor could
                            he have done so, as he was only authorized to act in conjunction with
                            his colleagues; that they had no such authority till February, 1862, and
                            when they were prepared to act Mr. Harris had declined a conference, as
                            he was daily expecting my arrival. The governor replied that Mr. Harris
                            had certainly given such assent, and that the government had his letter
                            to that effect.</p>
                        <p>I then produced the letter of the Japanese government asking Mr. Harris
                            to reduce to writing what he had said on the subject of an official
                            interview, and his indorsement that no answer was necessary. I also
                            produced the letter of the President and of the department in answer to
                            the letter of the Tycoon and the ministers, and read Mr. Harris’s letter
                            to Sir Rutherford Alcock, and I expressed my surprise that, while an
                            embassy had been despatched to Europe to ask for such extension, the
                            only minister in Yedo had never been addressed on so important a
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>The governor hastily left the legation, and returning the next day, said
                            the government had been laboring under a great mistake; that it had no
                            such letter as had been supposed; that it had been grossly negligent,
                            and must throw itself on my indulgence, and now ask me to give such
                            consent on behalf of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I replied I had not overlooked the subject nor underrated its importance,
                            and had supposed the Japanese government knew its own business best, and
                            when ready would propose such modification of the treaty. It had now
                            done so, and I was prepared to act, but I thought it could scarcely be
                            expected, that the United States would consent to a modification of the
                            treaty proposed that day, when not even the receipt of my letters
                            proposing other modifications had been acknowledged. This led to the
                            appointment of commissioners, the negotiations of which you have been
                            advised, and the framing a treaty for the reduction of duties, the
                            establishment of bonded warehouses, &amp;c. As originally agreed on, the
                            postponement of the opening of Hioga, Osacca, &amp;c., formed one of the
                            articles; but on my suggestion, as the reduction of duty was to be
                            permanent, and such postponement to be made only for five years, and as
                            the Japanese government might wish to publish the one and not the
                            others, such postponement was omitted from the treaty and embraced in a
                            distinct article.</p>
                        <p>When the convention was finally signed, I executed the agreement of which
                            I now enclose a copy, and the ministers for foreign affairs have
                            promised to appoint commissioners to visit me in June to agree on the
                            bonded warehouse system. I enclose, No. 2, translation of that
                            letter.</p>
                        <p>The above is a brief history of so much of the negotiations as has not
                            already been communicated; and will explain the delay in giving the
                            consent of the <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0504"/>United States to
                            the postponement asked for by the Japanese government, and which I see
                            by your letter to Mr. Pike, our minister at the Hague, you supposed had
                            been given.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch No. 51, of the 24th of October last, in which
                            you say:</p>
                        <p>“Upon the testimony already received relative to the destruction by fire
                            of the legation buildings at Yedo, the President considers it to have
                            been offensive and criminal, not an accidental occurrence; and this
                            government will expect indemnity therefor. Should you come to a
                            different conclusion, however, the subject will be reconsidered.”</p>
                        <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0505"/>
                        <p>As you have been advised, I have presented the demands I was instructed
                            to make on the Japanese government. Although in the first instance they
                            were summarily rejected, I have the satisfaction to inform you that
                            commissioners have been appointed to confer with me on the subject, with
                            whom I had an interview yesterday of several hours.</p>
                        <p>Although I cannot say I confidently expect, yet I do not entirely despair
                            of, a satisfactory result. The claims for injuries on citizens of the
                            United States at this place are attended with embarrassments it will be
                            exceedingly difficult to overcome.</p>
                        <p>There have been, unfortunately, very many instances where Japanese have
                            been grossly maltreated by foreigners, and no indemnity asked or paid.
                            Indeed, it admits of some question whether it would be safe, in view of
                            the character of the floating population of the treaty powers, at the
                            open ports, to establish the principle of the liability of a government
                            for the act of its individual citizens or subjects. I have, in the cases
                            now under consideration, insisted on those points which make them
                            exceptional cases: first, the government has not punished, but, as far
                            as seen, has actually rewarded the offenders; secondly, the injuries did
                            not arise in the ordinary course of business, but grew directly out of
                            the action of the government, which created alarm among the native
                            population, and though it is alleged that the notice was misunderstood,
                            that does not diminish the liability of the government; thirdly, this
                            liability is increased by the criminal neglect of the governor of
                            Kanagawa, while the mob was in the ascendant, which neglect appeared to
                            amount to a continuance of, or connivance with, the offenders.</p>
                        <p>You will observe that in presenting the demands I entered fully into
                            particulars. My object in doing so was to save you, as far as possible,
                            the necessity of explanations at home, and to enable the Japanese
                            government, if disposed, to answer each allegation and urge any
                            mitigating circumstances, and thus have a case presented which would
                            allow of the withdrawal of the demands altogether, or justify them if
                            admitted, and if refused, show that such measures as might become
                            necessary for their enforcement were clearly required.</p>
                        <p>Although some correspondence has passed since the letters which have been
                            transmitted, it contains nothing material to the decision of the
                            question.</p>
                        <p>The present attitude of the government makes me indulge the hope that the
                            reactionary party has entirely failed, and that the foreign policy of
                            the government is now fixed and may be relied on as favorable to a
                            continuance of peace and the observance of the treaties. The utmost
                            moderation will be the best policy. The dictates of an enlightened
                            humanity have justified the friendly and patient forbearance which has
                            heretofore characterized our relations with this government; and it is
                            pleasant to believe that such forbearance is still compatible with our
                            true interests as being best calculated to overcome the obstacles
                            arising from the laws and institutions of the government and the
                            prejudices of the ruling class.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you of the
                            second visit of the Tycoon to the Mikado.</p>
                        <p>It is understood the great council of Daimios is again in session; that
                            the question of the foreign policy of the government is again under
                            consideration, and that the opposite parties are pretty evenly balanced.
                            All that is possible is to watch and wait and hope.</p>
                        <p>I think I have remarked that the Tycoon has at this time all the
                            advantages of trade, every port open being in imperial territory. There
                            are many Daimios who advocate the removal of every restriction to trade
                            and the opening of every port.</p>
                        <p>I enclose a copy of a very extraordinary letter from the Prince of
                            Etshizen, which I have reason to believe to be genuine, as it was
                            obtained from the same source from which I procured other documents
                            which I have heretofore sent you. It speaks well for the advance of
                            liberal ideas, and if, as he says, other Daimios are of the same
                            opinion, we may reasonably look for great and favor able changes.</p>
                        <p>This prince was the only one who, in the great council of Daimios held
                            last year, advocated with boldness the observance of the treaties with
                            foreign nations and a liberal policy of the government.</p>
                        <p>It has now been informally announced that the Tycoon will return to Yedo
                            in the latter part of this month.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obedient

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that the
                            Princes of Aki, Sendai, and Thizen have been ordered to occupy the
                            territories of the Prince of Shoshu, or Nagato.</p>
                        <p>Some time after the issue of these orders one of Satsuma’s steamers, the
                            “Sir Charles Forbes,” on her way through the Inland sea, was fired on by
                            the batteries of Nagato, and the steamer was sunk.</p>
                        <p>I have been promised, from a Japanese source, a copy of the letter
                            addressed by the Prince of Satsuma to the government of the Tycoon,
                            complaining of this outrage.</p>
                        <p>It is claimed, I understand, by Nagato that the vessel was fired on at
                            night, and that it was not known she belonged to Satsuma.</p>
                        <p>Nagato’s position of outlawry is sufficient, if any doubt could have
                            existed, to demonstrate the wisdom of sending the Wyoming against him.
                            And I may remark that no occurrence has made such a deep and favorable
                            impression on this government.</p>
                        <p>If one vessel could accomplish so much, how can we possibly resist the
                            navies <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0507"/>of America and Europe,
                            is the natural question; and the number of those who judge successful
                            resistance possible must be small, if indeed any prince can be found so
                            arrogant and ignorant.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I regret to have to inform you that a
                                murderous attack on a foreigner by a Japanese was made at this port
                                in the foreign quarter, on the night of the 3d instant. It is the
                                first occurrence of the kind that has taken place here, and has
                                created a very unsatisfactory feeling among the foreign residents.
                                The victim is an Englishman named Sutton; well known to every one as
                                a sober, <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0508"/>peaceable,
                                inoffensive man. He received a severe sword cut on the neck, and two
                                on the left arm—one of the latter severing the bones. The blow at
                                the neck was evidently intended to take the head off, and only
                                failed in its object by coming in contact with a thick coat
                                collar.</p>
                            <p>Sutton still lives, and there are good hopes of his recovery,
                                although the wounds are severe. The ruffian who made the assault
                                escaped and has not yet been arrested. The British consul informed
                                me yesterday that the local authorities express much regret at the
                                occurrence, and profess the greatest desire to arrest the
                                perpetrator, saying they were making the greatest efforts to do so.
                                I may say that Sutton is personally known to me, and I am convinced
                                there could have been no provocation to the assault on his part,
                                either at the time or at any other time. The assault occurred at
                                about 8 o’clock, or soon after dark.</p>
                            <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that an
                            embassy has proceeded to Europe, which is also accredited to the United
                            States. As it is certain that it will fail to accomplish the result
                            desired in Europe, it is possible that it may not think it desirable to
                            visit our country.</p>
                        <p>As I have already informed you, such purpose was made known to me
                            verbally, and I now enclose, No. 1, copy of a letter of the Gorogio,
                            announcing their intention, and, No. 2, copy of my reply to that
                            letter.</p>
                        <p>Being satisfied that “the means to tranquillize the public feeling, and
                            the measures to perpetuate the good relations of peace and friendship
                            between the two countries,” veiled a purpose to ask further concessions,
                            I embraced the opportunity afforded by an appeal to me, to assure the
                            governor for foreign affairs that it was necessary I should understand
                            precisely what was desired, to enable me to be of any service.</p>
                        <p>I thereupon addressed a letter to the Gorogio, of which I enclose a copy,
                            (enclosure No. 3,) and received in reply a letter, of which I enclose
                            translation, (No. 4,) which discloses the object of the embassy to be
                            precisely what I had imagined.</p>
                        <p>I consider it unnecessary to make any comment on so extraordinary a
                            proposition. It is scarcely possible to conceive that the government is
                            serious in making the request, while it may be that the embassy is sent
                            simply for the purpose of quieting the hostile Daimios, and of gaining
                            time, which will either enable them to prepare for contemplated
                            hostilities, or altogether avert them, as may be their purpose; it may
                            also be possible that the facility with which they have obtained past
                            concessions, on their statement that it was necessary for the
                            maintenance of tranquillity and peace, may have encouraged them to hope
                            for still further success. This government has no idea of the large
                            sacrifice of property such a concession would involve.</p>
                        <p>It is scarcely necessary for me to say, that I am confident no further
                            concessions of any character whatever should be made.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                            <p>We have to inform your excellency that the great departure from the
                                ancient custom in entering upon foreign intercourse led to much
                                trouble of various kinds; public feeling became unsettled, and civil
                                commotion was the result, as you have heard and witnessed. Though we
                                strenuously exerted ourselves in devising and taking measures to
                                quiet the public feeling and bring it in harmony with the change,
                                yet the result thus far has not been satisfactory; and hence we lost
                                some of the good will of your government, and the relations of peace
                                and amity are not as heretofore, owing to the firing upon the
                                American ship in the principality of Nagato.</p>
                            <p>We feel much displeased about this, as the action of our government
                                may be deemed unjust. Wherefore, having selected the governors for
                                foreign affairs, Ikeda Tskungo-no-kami, Kawadze Idlu-no-kami, and
                                the Ouretske (censor,) Kawada Kwannosuke, as his envoys, his Majesty
                                the Tycoon, sends them on a special mission to your capital.</p>
                            <p>As all the circumstances how the inconveniences kept increasing until
                                now cannot be stated in a letter with sufficient accuracy, they will
                                verbally represent this to your government, and frankly confer with
                                it about the means to tranquillize the public feeling in our
                                country, and about the measures to perpetuate the good relations of
                                peace and friendship between the two countries without injury to
                                many human beings. We therefore request your excellency fully to
                                make known the foregoing to your government.</p>

                            <p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your excellencies’
                                letter of the 2d instant. So much of said letter as refers to your
                                domestic difficulties relates to a subject of which the President
                                has already had full information. And, while it will afford him
                                great satisfaction to learn of the adoption of measures which will
                                entirely tranquillize the public feeling of Japan, he will advise
                                your envoys, as I have already advised your excellencies, that the
                                restoration of tranquillity depends upon your own internal policy
                                and management, and is not to be effected by holding out to the
                                hostile and dissatisfied hopes of further concessions by the treaty
                                powers, which will not be given.</p>
                            <p>While it will doubtless afford the President much satisfaction to
                                receive your renewed assurance of regret that the American steamer
                                Pembroke was fired upon by the prince of Nagata’s batteries, it will
                                not surprise your excellencies if he attach less value to those
                                assurances while you are occasioning daily loss to the owners of
                                that ship by witholding the indemnity you have promised to pay.</p>
                            <p>The President will ever be solicitous for the preservation of the
                                most friendly relations between the two countries, and he will be
                                highly pleased to receive the assurances of the government of his
                                Majesty the Tycoon, that it is animated by <pb n="490"
                                    xml:id="pg_490" facs="0510"/>the same desire. But the only sure
                                basis on which peace can rest is, that each country avoid injury to
                                the citizens and subjects of the other; or, if by the acts of
                                lawless men such injury is done, prompt reparation be made to the
                                party aggrieved.</p>
                            <p>No country is disgraced when excited or bad men violate the laws.
                                Offenders against law, unfortunately, exist in every country. It is
                                only when offenders are permitted to escape punishment, and injuries
                                are done to friendly powers for which no reparation is made, that a
                                government fails in duty to those who repose in their good
                                faith.</p>
                            <p>The assurances of your excellencies of your desire to cultivate
                                friendship with the United States, however pleasant they may be to
                                the President, will lack the essential quality of value derived from
                                treaties fulfilled and wrongs redressed; and it will be no excuse
                                which the President can accept, “That it will be a disgrace to Japan
                                to admit that criminals have done these injuries,” because criminals
                                do exist here as elsewhere. The President has the right to insist on
                                their punishment, and compensation for their acts, when these
                                lawless acts injure citizens of the United States, and such cases
                                have arisen and now exist.</p>
                            <p>While, therefore, I say to your excellencies that you have a perfect
                                right to send embassies to the United States as often as you think
                                proper, I am bound to say, with the same frankness, that while these
                                envoys will be received in a friendly manner, as coming from an
                                avowedly friendly power, they can scarcely expect that warm and
                                friendly reception which was accorded to your former embassy,
                                because your excellencies will have failed to redress injuries of
                                which the President has felt obliged to complain. And there will,
                                therefore, be a sad difference between the professions and the
                                action of the government of his Majesty the Tycoon.</p>

                                the consul-general of the Netherlands in our interview at the naval

                            respectively.</p>
                        <p>I have repeatedly insisted on provision being made for my residence at
                            Yedo, but without success. The extraordinary position has been taken
                            that my residence there, while my colleagues are content to remain at
                            Kanagawa, will be regarded as a proof of want of friendship for the
                            government.</p>
                        <p>By governors for foreign affairs I was verbally informed that the
                            government has placed money in the hands of the priest, to enable him to
                            rebuild the buildings which were destroyed, but do not know how much
                            credit to give to the information, as I had been previously informed by
                            other governors that the work was commenced, and when I went to Yedo
                            found that no commencement had been made.</p>
                        <p>I shall write to the minister for foreign affairs, and learn whether they
                            can now insure my safety at Yedo; and if so, not wait for the completion
                            of the building, but occupy such quarters as were provided for my
                            temporary use, although they are exceedingly inconvenient.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that
                            affairs wear a most threatening aspect. The government seems to be
                            determined in its efforts to close this port, and has announced to the
                            British minister that it was essential to the preservation of peace. The
                            same subject was forced on the French minister in his first visit to the
                            Gorogio, which was simply one of ceremony, and language used even more
                            threatening.</p>
                        <p>The ministers of the United States, Great Britain, France, and the
                            Netherlands, have had several conferences of late and are in perfect
                            accord. We propose to unite in a letter to the government with a view to
                            check its reactionary policy.</p>
                        <p>Her British Majesty’s ship Conqueror, with a battalion of marines, is
                            daily expected, and the balance of the 20th regiment is also en route
                            for this place. On their arrival the British will have a force of 1,500
                            men here, exclusive of the marines and sailors of their powerful
                            squadron of fourteen ships. There is in addition a French force of about
                            one hundred bayonets, beside the corvette Duplex and two Dutch
                            corvettes.</p>
                        <p>I have written to Captains Price and McDougal, as I learn the Alabama is
                            again at Capetown, asking their presence here if consistent with their
                            orders; and I also think it proper to say, that I most sincerely hope
                            that the position of affairs at home will permit the President to
                            despatch a strong re-enforcement to the squadron in the China seas.</p>
                        <p>I have thus far abstained from any such request because of the home
                            demands, and also because I thought ships could be safely dispensed with
                            here; but I think I should be remiss in duty if I failed to ask for them
                            now.</p>
                        <p>I hope my fears will prove groundless, but all my colleagues concur in
                            the opinion that it <hi rend="italic">would</hi> be unsafe to rely too
                            much on the continuance of peace, though we shall all labor to maintain
                            it.</p>
                        <p>There can be no doubt that the withdrawal of the ships now here would be
                            the signal for an instantaneous outbreak, and it would appear fair that
                            the United States should participate in protecting our common rights and
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Sir Rutherford Alcock has shown me a
                            letter from Earl Russell to Lord Cowley, in reply to questions addressed
                            to him by the French minister for foreign affairs, M. Drouyn de l’Huys,
                            in which he says that her Majesty’s government has no wish to see the
                            Japanese embassay in London, and that it will most decidedly decline
                            consenting to the closing of this port.</p>
                        <p>The President has doubtless been made acquainted with the views of the
                            British government, and it is needless for me to express any opinion, as
                            he has already approved of my resistance to this demand.</p>
                        <p>I am pleased to see from the language used by Earl Russell that the
                            reception of the Japanese envoys will be of such a character, and the
                            answer to their request so decided, as to prevent hereafter any appeal
                            to the treaty powers from the ministers accredited to this government,
                            as success in such an appeal would make the position of the foreign
                            ministers unpleasant, and deprive them of all influence, and almost
                            render their presence here useless.</p>

                            information, No. 1, copy of a letter addressed to me by Sir Rutherford
                            Alcock, and, No. 2, copy of my reply, which will fully explain our
                            opinion in reference to the present condition of Japan.</p>
                        <p>These letters were exchanged after several conferences, which were
                            rendered advisable by the accumulation of documentary and verbal proof
                            of the growing ascendency of the hostile party.</p>
                        <p>The minister of France did not favor us with his views in writing, as his
                            successor arrived a few days after the receipt by him of the letter of
                            the British minister, but I am able to say that both the late and
                            present minister of France concur in opinion that there is great reason
                            to fear that the government may be unable, if really disposed, to resist
                            the pressure upon it.</p>
                        <p>How long the struggle may be postponed is extremely doubtful; whether it
                            will be possible to avert it altogether is exceedingly improbable,
                            unless, indeed, the treaty powers will consent to give up their right of
                            trade and residence.</p>
                        <p>The two centuries in which Japan remained isolated and unchanged were
                            centuries of unparalleled progress in Europe and America; and now that
                            its ports are opened, the past and the present stand face to face. These
                            two forces will only harmonize as do light and darkness. One or the
                            other must disappear. They cannot quietly coexist when brought into
                            contact.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to enclose Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6, copies of four Japanese
                            documents received from the British minister, which constitute a part of
                            the evidence in our possession to prove that hostilities are
                            contemplated by the <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0515"/>government
                            as well as the Daimios, and that preparations for the same continue to
                            be made.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Several documents, bearing certain
                                internal evidence of authenticity, have recently come into my
                                possession from two independent sources. Assuming them to be
                                genuine, they are calculated to throw some light on what has
                                recently been taking place at Kioto during the great gathering of
                                Daimios and the sojourn of the Tycoon at the capital of the Mikado.
                                And as much of the information to be extracted from them shows very
                                clearly the policy they have pledged themselves to carry out in
                                respect to foreigners and the treaty powers generally, without
                                distinction, I have had careful translations made, in the belief
                                that if these documents have not already reached you from other
                                quarters you will be glad to have them. I beg to enclose copies for
                                your information.</p>
                            <p>My own impression of the importance of the facts disclosed as to the
                                course of action determined upon by the Mikado, Tycoon, and Daimios
                                conjointly, and the insecurity of the position they have made for
                                us, leads me to the conclusion that it would be well if the example
                                set by our avowed enemies, of an interchange of opinions and
                                combinations of plans, were adopted by the representatives of
                                foreign powers here. With a view to prepare the way for such
                                collective action, and inviting at the same time the expression of
                                your own individual opinion, I venture to submit the following
                                observations as touching the principal matters for
                                consideration.</p>
                            <p>I infer that these documents, whether faithful transcripts of
                                originals, or garbled versions and extracts only, do certainly and
                                substantially state the truth, both as to the existence of such
                                originals and their purport. We are, no doubt, exposed to every kind
                                of complicity and imposition on the part of those who know our
                                anxiety for information, and supply it either to serve their own
                                ends or the ends of the Tycoon government. But in the latter case it
                                does not always follow that the information must be false. It may
                                occasionally happen that the truth may be more serviceable to the
                                Tycoon and his party than any falsehood, however ingeniously
                                devised. That may be the case in this instance if it should turn out
                                that the Tycoon does not covet the task, apparently assigned him, of
                                driving out the foreigners, and dreads the issue. Under such
                                circumstances it is easy to conceive that he would not be averse to
                                our being advised of the whole scheme in time to enable us to save
                                him from the disagreeable necessity of putting himself forward.
                                Whether this were effected by our taking alarm and leaving the
                                country, or by intimidating those who would urge on an attack to
                                expel us, might be comparatively matter of indifference. And if the
                                knowledge of the doing at Kioto, conveyed in these papers, be little
                                likely to effect the first of these ends, it is impossible to deny
                                that there is much to suggest the necessity of securing the other.
                                This appears to me to form the main subject for consideration.</p>
                            <p>We have to take into our view, in connexion with these documents, and
                                as corroborative evidence of their genuine character, a number of
                                overt acts on the <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0516"/>part of
                                the chief personages, about which there is no question whatever: The
                                Mikado’s decree for the expulsion of foreigners, officially
                                communicated by the Tycoon, after a time withdrawn, and a
                                modification in the programme substituted, calling upon us only to
                                vacate Yokohama; the erection of numerous batteries at all the ports
                                and in front of Yedo, designed to make those places more difficult
                                of approach, at the same time that they menace the security of the
                                foreign residents; the activity shown in the manufacture of arms;
                                the large sums expended in the purchase of munitions of war and
                                steamships; the enrolment and drilling of men everywhere going on
                                even under our eyes; the resumption, with great earnestness, of an
                                undertaking often before contemplated, but abandoned, owing to the
                                enormous difficulty and cost of the enterprise, I allude to a great
                                road the Tycoon is engaged in cutting through a range of hills which
                                lie between Yedo and the rice-growing districts of Yetrigo, on the
                                western coast, from whence the capital draws its chief supplies. The
                                object obviously is to render it independent of any supplies brought
                                by sea, upon which, at present, they are almost exclusively
                                compelled to rely. Finally, the despatch of the last mission with
                                the declared object of inducing the treaty powers to withdraw from
                                Yokohami.</p>
                            <p>If all these proceedings be taken as a whole and in connexion with
                                each other, there cannot well be any doubt whether a policy
                                originating such measures is tending, or to what end it is directed.
                                The documents now presented are in perfect accord, and may the more
                                readily, therefore, be accepted as reliable sources of information
                                in reference to existing political combinations and their
                                object.</p>
                            <p>That these nearly concern us, and should be regarded as of deep
                                interest, needs no demonstration. There is little difficulty in
                                eliminating from all the verbiage and involution of Oriental
                                phraseology one dominant idea, and that is, the final expulsion of
                                the foreigner. This, however, is no less clearly shown to be held in
                                check by a fear of consequences, and a consciousness of immediate
                                danger in any attempt to pass at once to action. Hence the result of
                                this grand convocation of notabilities of the highest powers in the
                                state, and of all the deliberations that have taken place, is not a
                                decree for our immediate expulsion, but for the postponement of any
                                effort to give time for more adequate preparation, while the signal
                                is given for the greatest activity in this work which is sooner or
                                later to serve the end.</p>
                            <p>One question only seems to arise at this point, but it is all
                                important. Do the several parties at work and the chief
                                interlocutors in these documents, Mikado, Tycoon, and Daimios, not
                                only wish our expulsion, of which there can be very little doubt,
                                but mean, in earnest, to compass that end at whatever cost or
                                sacrifice, believing in its practicability? or do they merely employ
                                such language as supplying the fitting and proper terms to use under
                                the circumstances in order to meet a hostile clamor and gain time
                                with the view of tiding over present difficulties? Because, if the
                                latter could be safely assumed, it may be well to wait and watch the
                                course of events. We could, in that case, perhaps, be patient under
                                a continual menace of hostilities and an occasional assassination,
                                however unenviable and undesirable such a position may be; but if,
                                on the contrary, they earnestly mean what they say, it might
                                undoubtedly be a wiser policy to anticipate attack, and strike a
                                blow calculated to put an end to this continuous agitation—this
                                state of active preparation for our forcible expulsion or
                                extermination as might chance—an agitation which, be it remarked,
                                    <hi rend="italic">en passant</hi>, is itself a source of
                                considerable danger, injurious to the prestige of foreign powers,
                                and affecting not only the stability of our position, but the
                                security of life and property.</p>
                            <p>I have referred to this as the one all-important question, because
                                there seems a present necessity for taking the one view or the other
                                to represent the truth, as the basis of any consistent policy on the
                                part of those treaty powers who <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497"
                                    facs="0517"/>have vested interests at stake and contemplate upon
                                insisting upon the maintenance of permanent relations of amity and
                                commerce with Japan.</p>
                            <p>I cannot but conclude, upon a careful review of all the facts known
                                to us, that there is a settled purpose to get rid of foreigners, and
                                either to expel them from the Japanese territories altogether, or,
                                failing this, to lock them up within the fortified barriers of
                                Nagasaki, where entrance and escape are alike difficult, if not
                                impossible, without the consent of those who hold the keys. To those
                                who adopt this conclusion little remains but to consider what is
                                likely to be the Japanese plan of operation, in order to form an
                                opinion as to the relative expediency of a passive and expectant
                                policy on the one hand, or a bolder and more decisive course of
                                action, with a view to bring a quarrel (which is only adjourned by
                                the Japanese in order to give them time to strike with more effect)
                                to a more speedy issue when the choice of time and place will be
                                ours, not theirs, and the advantage of preparation will not be, as
                                is now intended, on the enemy’s side.</p>
                            <p>Before considering the latter alternative it may be well to take note
                                of some very cogent reasons which seem to exist against an entirely
                                passive and expectant policy.</p>
                            <p>If an avowed enemy is actively preparing to undermine and attack our
                                position, it can hardly be wise to allow him to complete the sap,
                                with a match in his hand, which we cannot see or prevent his
                                applying to the train at his own time. We cannot always be in a
                                state of preparation either for sudden retreat or defence. Great
                                Britain has, at this moment, a considerable squadron in these seas,
                                and troops within reach. But this cannot be counted upon as a
                                permanent state of affairs.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese know that any outbreak of war among the treaty powers
                                might change these dispositions, and leave all the foreign residents
                                helpless. We have the misfortune to be surrounded by possible
                                enemies, whose unfriendliness would at once assume the form of open
                                hostility, if there appeared but a prospect of success. Remembering,
                                also, that in the east at least there is no effective diplomacy,
                                without force for its background, it behooves the treaty powers to
                                decide while it is yet time between the only two courses open. The
                                passive policy, however watchful, cannot be called defensive, where
                                no defence is possible, as is the case even at this moment. If any
                                doubts prevail on this subject, the several reports of military
                                authorities, now in my hands, will effectually dispel such illusion.
                                The defencelessness of this community, indeed, notwithstanding the
                                pretence of a large squadron, is one of the strongest arguments
                                against an indefinitely prolonged state of suspense and inaction.
                                All the competent military authorities which have been consulted are
                                perfectly unanimous as to the utter absence of any effective means
                                of defence, even from the attack of small desultory bands of armed
                                men. There is nothing to prevent their penetrating the settlement,
                                setting it on fire, and murdering the greater part of the
                                inhabitants before they could either escape or destroy their
                                assailants. To make any defence would require the erection of
                                barriers, guard-houses, barracks, a free command of labor, a large
                                expenditure of money, and, at least, three months of time. Then,
                                only with one thousand men at command, it is considered the place
                                might be made tolerably secure against desultory attacks. No one of
                                these conditions exists or can be realized; for, if there is peril
                                in waiting until danger is at the door, there are insuperable
                                obstacles to any adequate preparation in advance. The Japanese would
                                not supply the land for guard houses and barracks, or the labor; and
                                any political agents insisting upon making the attempt might
                                possibly precipitate a collision, and would certainly lay themselves
                                open, both in this community and at home, to the onerous charge of
                                unnecessarily provoking the danger they sought to avert. Nagasaki is
                                indefensible under <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0518"/>any
                                circumstances, and Hakodadi could just as little be suddenly
                                covered, or the people taken away. In this dilemma, if it be really
                                believed that the Japanese ruling powers are in earnest in their
                                plans for our expulsion, or even that some are, and the Tycoon’s
                                government, through lukewarmness in their cause, is not to be
                                trusted by foreigners, what course may be open to the treaty powers
                                equally anxious to prevent such a consummation, and avert a national
                                war on a large scale.</p>
                            <p>The indiscriminate attack on foreign flags, the stoppage of native
                                junks, even when carrying produce for foreign markets, and the
                                closure of the Inland sea by the Prince of Chosen, are such
                                undoubted acts of hostility directed against foreign powers as amply
                                to justify any hostile action on their part, which may be directed
                                against him or his batteries. The Tycoon’s government might not be
                                unwilling to co-operate or to sanction a decisive blow at this
                                puissant Daimio, who seems to set all native authority, as well as
                                foreign powers, at defiance. If such a measure could be successfully
                                carried out by even three or four of the chief treaty powers,
                                cordially joining with whatever force each might have available, it
                                seems probable the result would go far not only to paralyze the
                                individual Daimio attacked, but all the hostile party, by showing
                                the utter worth-lessness of costly preparation, and their
                                incapability of making effective resistance. The Tycoon’s
                                concurrence, either in active operations or merely by consent, could
                                hardly fail to isolate him from the anti-foreign faction, and
                                probably would compel him to adopt with more sincerity a friendly
                                policy. In the event of his refusing to participate in a measure of
                                this nature, it would have to be determined whether such refusal
                                should or should not deprive the treaty powers of all action
                                calculated to extricate them from a false position—one of prolonged
                                doubt, under open menace of expulsion, contrary to the stipulations
                                of treaties. If such a course of action should be adopted by common
                                consent, whether with or without the Tycoon’s consent, the result
                                might reasonably be expected to be beneficial, either in preventing
                                an attack upon the foreign communities, and thus averting a
                                catastrophe first, and a war afterwards; or in compelling those who
                                contemplated this end to act decisively at a disadvantage, and
                                before they had all the time they desired for preparation. In the
                                present state of unpreparedness, in which Japan confessedly is for
                                war with a western power, any diplomacy on their part which gains
                                time is obviously an advantage to them; but it would be far better
                                for the treaty powers, and, I believe, also better for the true
                                interests of the Japanese, as a nation, to bring it to an issue at
                                once. The struggle will be less protracted, the area of the conflict
                                more restricted, and the war itself, if war there should be, on a
                                less costly scale, Whereas if nothing be done to place foreign
                                relations on a more stable footing, and with better prospect of
                                security to the interests at stake than is consistent with the
                                present policy of the Japanese government, there does not seem a
                                hope that either time, the efforts of diplomacy, or the spontaneous
                                action of the ruling powers in Japan will bring about any
                                improvement. It seems still more impossible that the <hi
                                    rend="italic">status quo</hi>, were it less satisfactory, can be
                                maintained. Rapid and serious deterioration, which sooner or later
                                must end in hostilities, can alone be anticipated, and the longer
                                they are deferred the more extended is likely to be the field of
                                operations.</p>
                            <p>I have thus unreservedly given my own views on the present aspect of
                                affairs, and the attitude taken by the Japanese ruling powers. I
                                speak of them collectively, for, at the present moment, the action
                                of Mikado, Tycoon, and influential Daimios is so confusedly blended,
                                that it is impossible to assign to each their part. My object is to
                                elicit an equally frank expression of opinion from my colleagues as
                                the best mode of arriving at some common base of operations, and <pb
                                    n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0519"/>to make head against those
                                who seem resolved on making no distinction whether as regards
                                nations or persons.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient, humble servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of your letter of the 22d ultimo, and to present my thanks
                                for your very full and frank expression of opinion as to the true
                                condition of affairs in this country.</p>
                            <p>Recognizing fully the importance of a free interchange of views by
                                the representatives of the treaty powers, I proceed to notice the
                                topics you have presented, which I am relieved from doing at length,
                                in consequence of your interesting and elaborate discussion of them.
                                Under any circumstances it would be difficult to form an entirely
                                satisfactory judgment of the actual state of affairs in this empire
                                in consequence of the absence of the ordinary channels of
                                information in every country open to the foreign ministers resident
                                therein, and in consequence, also, of the limited means of
                                intercommunication. The difficulties arising from our extreme
                                isolation are greatly increased by the remarkable and habitual
                                reserve of the high officers of government, and their systematic
                                efforts to prevent information reaching us through unofficial
                                channels. The magnitude of this embarrassment can only be
                                appreciated by those resident in this country. Any important
                                information obtained through official sources can never be received
                                without distrust. The experience of all the ministers of the treaty
                                powers, I think, is, that this information is rarely given except
                                for the obvious purpose of qualifying or explaining away that which
                                is known or suspected to have been already acquired. I have
                                frequently, but without any apparent success, urged upon the
                                government of his Majesty the Tycoon the duty and policy of
                                manifesting more confidence, and displaying more frankness, in its
                                dealings with those representatives. Much of the information we now
                                have is conflicting, and a portion of it unworthy of credit. There
                                is on one point, however, a remarkably uniform concurrence, both in
                                the verbal reports and the documents we have severally had the good
                                fortune to secure. All unite in disclosing that the Daimios are
                                engaged in extensive and costly warlike preparations, and that while
                                a formidable minority believe in their ability to expel foreigners
                                now, very few distrust their eventual power to accomplish that
                                result. The great change recently made in the government, relieving
                                the Daimios from their compulsory and burdensome residence at Yedo,
                                was confessedly yielded for the purpose of enabling them to expend
                                larger sums in these preparations. There is probably as yet no fixed
                                purpose of action. But it cannot be doubted that great preparations
                                are in progress to effect our expulsion should it be finally decided
                                to make the attempt; nor can it be doubted that the large majority
                                of Daimios are bitterly opposed to the maintenance of the treaties.
                                The government of the Tycoon has succeeded in resisting this strong
                                current of opposition so as to prevent its assuming the form of
                                united action; and yet, within the past year, it was compelled to
                                yield to it, and give formal notice of its purpose to close the <pb
                                    n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0520"/>ports. After the Tycoon had
                                succeeded in escaping from the pressure, and felt himself secure at
                                Yedo, he was able to recall that order. But the combined forces
                                before which he had been obliged to succumb at Kioto were
                                sufficiently potent, even in his own capital, to compel him to seek
                                to obtain by negotiation what he feared, or was unwilling to attempt
                                by force. Hence the request made to surrender this port, and the
                                mission to the treaty powers with the avowed object of asking that
                                foreign trade be restricted to a port at the north, distant from the
                                chief products of the country, and to the port of Nagasaki, entirely
                                incapable of defence, and easily sealed to commerce, unless
                                protected by a powerful land force. It is to be hoped that the
                                government of the Tycoon is more enlightened as to its inability to
                                contend successfully with the treaty powers. But it is impossible to
                                believe it to be free from the prejudice and hostility which so
                                thoroughly pervade the privileged classes. All that can be expected
                                is, that fearing the result of a conflict, and satisfied that it can
                                only be averted by observing the treaties, it will in good faith
                                bend every power to their maintenance. I cannot see that any
                                injustice is committed towards the government by entertaining these
                                opinions. It must be sensible of the danger to which the
                                institutions of the country are exposed by the continuance of
                                foreign trade and intercourse, and it can scarcely be expected to
                                welcome cheerfully the presence of silent yet powerful forces, which
                                must eventually endanger its own existence. There can be no doubt
                                that the entire framework of society and government must be
                                remodelled in their presence, or it will crumble and disappear
                                before them. The ancient feudalism of Europe has its counterpart
                                here, tainted by a deeper corruption of morals, and unsoftened as
                                that was by a high sentiment of honor, a chivalric devotion to the
                                sex, and the precepts of the Christian religion. As that system fell
                                before the rise of the free cities, the spread of commerce, and more
                                enlightened views of liberty and government, so must the system
                                which fetters, paralyzes, and degrades Japan disappear in the
                                presence of the representatives of constitutional government, of a
                                wider commerce, and a purer Christianity.</p>
                            <p>That this danger is felt and appreciated is apparent from the
                                persistent but vain attempts which have been made to induce the
                                ministers of the treaty powers to recognize or establish among their
                                citizens and subjects resident here, distinctions analogous to those
                                existing in Japan, and to impose similar restrictions and
                                disabilities to those enforced by the Japanese laws.</p>
                            <p>As almost the entire profit of the foreign trade is absorbed by the
                                government of the Tycoon, or by the chief Daimios, who monopolize
                                the surplus products of the soil, the formation of a powerful and
                                wealthy middle class will be retarded, and to this extent the danger
                                to the privileged classes arrested.</p>
                            <p>At present, the only voice heard or power felt in Japan is that of
                                these privileged classes; and either to the extent of this
                                influence, or to the greater power of ignorance and prejudice, is to
                                be attributed the well known fact that the lower classes in this
                                town, notwithstanding their presumed friendship for foreigners, and
                                their obtaining from foreign trade a better support, were, less than
                                a year ago, prepared to commit any violence, and needed only a sign
                                to prompt them to an indiscriminate and bloody attack on the foreign
                                settlement.</p>
                            <p>In view of these facts, what is the duty of the treaty powers?
                                Manifestly to insist on the observance of the treaties, and neither
                                to surrender nor postpone any rights now acquired. At the same time,
                                they should, in my opinion, exercise great moderation and
                                forbearance in their treatment of the government, and give it credit
                                for sincerity, as far and as long as possible; sympathize with and
                                aid it in its difficulties, and strengthen it as far as may be safe,
                                to enable it to resist any probable combination of the Daimios, of
                                whom the Tycoon is not the sovereign, and who are in a great measure
                                independent.</p>
                            <p>Experience has demonstrated that if the hostilities of any of the
                                Daimios should manifest itself in acts, it is possible, to repress
                                and punish the offender <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0521"
                                />without bringing on a conflict with the government, and the most
                                efficient aid can probably thus be given to the government.</p>
                            <p>Entertaining these opinions, I felt it to be my duty to punish the
                                prince of Nagato for the outrage committed by him in firing on the
                                merchant steamer Pembroke, with such small force as I then had at my
                                disposal, and for the same reason I united with the representatives
                                of France, Great Britain, and the Netherlands, in a resolution
                                declaring that it was indispensable for the maintenance of treaty
                                rights immediately to reopen the inland sea by a combined operation
                                of the naval and military forces; at the same time giving the
                                Tycoon’s government an opportunity by its own means to render such
                                action unnecessary.</p>
                            <p>I regarded such action as alike demanded by the dignity of our
                                governments, and the safety of their citizens and subjects resident
                                in Japan, and as essential to the maintenance of peace.</p>
                            <p>The President of the United States has been pleased to approve of my
                                action.</p>
                            <p>No response has been made to the joint note by the government of his
                                Majesty the Tycoon, nor has anything been done to restrain the
                                Prince of Nagato from the commission of further violence or to
                                punish him for past offences.</p>
                            <p>Very soon a year will have passed away, and no attempt has been made
                                to carry into effect the deliberate decision of the representatives
                                of the treaty powers. It is much to be regretted that the memorandum
                                in question, now, perhaps, regarded as an idle menace, was
                                transmitted to the government. Nor should I have signed it had I
                                supposed that the failure of the Japanese government to act with
                                vigor and promptitude would not have been followed by appropriate
                                action by the treaty powers interested.</p>
                            <p>The original offence of the Prince of Nagato consisted in firing on a
                                merchant steamer of the United States, a despatch steamer of his
                                Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the French, and the Netherlands
                                steam corvette Medusa. I cannot see how, by doing so, he violated
                                any law of Japan. On the contrary, he respected that still existing
                                law which prohibits the presence of foreigners, and justifies any
                                violence even to death. I understand this to be his defence, and
                                that he acted under the direct orders of the Mikado.</p>
                            <p>I am, therefore, inclined to credit the reports of the reluctance and
                                refusal of Daimios to march their forces against him, and to believe
                                that if any punishment is inflicted, it will be for some independent
                                offence against the Tycoon, or for some breach of etiquette, such as
                                obeying the order of the Mikado transmitted direct and not through
                                the Tycoon.</p>
                            <p>When in the presence of my colleagues, I asked the vice minister
                                Sakai Hida-no-kami whether the Tycoon approved of the course of the
                                Prince of Nagato. His answer was, that “depended on the fact whether
                                he had acted under the orders of the Mikado; and if so, while he
                                ‘interiorly’ condemned, ‘exteriorly’ he would be obliged to
                                approve.”</p>
                            <p>The government was probably then aware that the hostile acts in
                                question were the legitimate results of the deliberations at Kioto.
                                It is also probable that the orders were transmitted direct to
                                prevent the Tycoon from delaying or qualifying them, and that Chosen
                                embraced the earliest opportunity to commence hostilities, hoping to
                                involve the government inextricably in war. The result was
                                different, however, from what he anticipated. The prompt and severe
                                punishment inflicted had the effect to intimidate the hostile
                                Daimios, who were easily convinced that it would be unsafe to
                                encounter all the treaty powers, while too weak to resist
                                successfully even one of them.</p>
                            <p>The government of the Tycoon was enabled, therefore, to obtain their
                                acquiescence in a resort to negotiation, the interval to be devoted
                                to preparation for an effectual and final struggle.</p>
                            <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0522"/>
                            <p>Had the Prince of Nagato abstained from further hostilities, the
                                opportunity for humbling his pride and crippling his resources would
                                now be lost. Unhappily for himself, but fortunately for this
                                government and for the preservation of peace, he has exhibited at
                                least the merit of consistency. He still obstructs commerce with
                                foreigners; to this end he has fired on a steamer of the Tycoon,
                                loaned to the Prince of Satsuma, and on junks of that prince,
                                engaged in carrying cotton to Nagasaki. His batteries have been
                                multiplied, and his cannon line the straits of Simonoseki. The
                                inland sea is closed to commerce; no merchant ship dares to pass
                                through it.</p>
                            <p>It is the earnest desire of the President of the United States to
                                preserve peaceful relations with the government of Japan, and I have
                                faithfully and zealously labored to that end.</p>
                            <p>In the hope that peace can thus be most effectually preserved, I am
                                prepared to meet with my colleagues, and after fully considering the
                                existing exceptional and hostile attitude of this prince, and the
                                state of affairs in Japan, concert such measures as may be regarded
                                as essential to the preservation of our treaty rights</p>
                            <p>I entertain no doubt that a result may be attained which will enable
                                us to do this without any conflict with the government, and which
                                will, in fact, greatly strengthen it, and avert the civil war it has
                                so long feared.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be your most obedient, humble servant,</p>

                            <p>We, an humble personage, and feeling our unworthiness to hold the
                                position of Son of Heaven, have from gratitude, since our succession
                                to the throne of our ancestors, always been in anxiety, fearing lest
                                we should be unable to gain by our action the approbation of our
                                forefathers and satisfaction of our subjects.</p>
                            <p>One of the principal causes of our uneasiness is the often repeated
                                appearance of foreign barbarians, who have violently visited our
                                ports, since the 6th year of Kalie, (1853,) and have greatly
                                endangered the integrity of our country. The prices of many articles
                                of daily use have risen, and our subjects have greatly suffered in
                                consequence.</p>
                            <p>What shall the Gods of Heaven and earth think of me?</p>
                            <p>Oh! whose fault, whose mistake is this?</p>
                            <p>Night and day these thoughts torment me without ceasing.</p>
                            <p>I have held a council the other day with my military nobility,
                                (Daimios and nobles,) but unfortunately inured to habits of peace,
                                which for more than two hundred years has existed in our country, we
                                are unable to exclude and subdue our foreign enemies by the forcible
                                means of war.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, if we, without duly considering this, do raise the law of
                                expulsion and extermination, surely miseries and calamities without
                                measure will fall upon our country.</p>
                            <p>The Tycoon (Bakfoo) has seen into my heart, and has amended the laws
                                which existed for ten generations. He has lessened the servitude of
                                the Daimios, and allowed them to take their families to their
                                respective countries, and ordered that the requisites of war and
                                military exercise should be more extensively <pb n="503"
                                    xml:id="pg_503" facs="0523"/>carried out. He has reduced
                                unnecessary offices and expenses, and prepared many ships-of-war and
                                cannons. All this pleases not only us, but shall greatly delight our
                                ancestors and subjects.</p>
                            <p>Also the re-establishment of the old custom, by which the Tycoon came
                                last spring to my court, meets highly with my approbation.</p>
                            <p>Against my expectation, Tusiwara Saneyosi and others took for good
                                the unruly and impracticable proposals of ill-disposed people, and
                                not taking into consideration the state of progress in the world,
                                nor the danger of our own country, did, under my name, circulate the
                                inconsiderate mandate for the expulsion of barbarians, and he
                                attempted also to create a war in order to destroy the Tycoon.</p>
                            <p>In regard to our rebellious and disobedient subject, Nagato Saijo,
                                who deceived his master, fired carelessly upon foreign ships,
                                murdered in secret the Tycoon’s envoy, and, without order from us,
                                took Saneyosi and others to his country; such mad people ought not
                                to be allowed to escape without condign punishment. However, taking
                                into consideration that all this was caused by my own want of
                                ability, I most deeply repent my mistakes, and feel ashamed.</p>
                            <p>If we compare our Japanese ships-of-war and cannon to those of the
                                barbarians, we feel certain that they are not sufficient to inflict
                                terror upon the foreign barbarians, and are, also, insufficient to
                                make the splendor of Japan show in foreign countries. I should think
                                that we only should make ourselves ridiculous in the eyes of the
                                barbarians.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, my desire is as follows: With the combined strength of
                                Japan to erect fortifications on the principal points of the
                                seaboard, in order to protect the capital and respect the laws of
                                our country and protect our subjects against foreigners, and taking
                                the force of the different Daimios, to let each of them defend their
                                own sea-coast and harbors, (and if the foreigners should attack,)
                                take large numbers of our ships-of-war, and destroy the
                                never-satisfied, ugly barbarians, in order to carry out the laws of
                                our ancestors, which direct the extermination of barbarians.</p>
                            <p>The Tycoon last year remained a long time in Kioto, and this spring
                                has come again to Kioto; many Daimios have also incurred large
                                expenses by coming to Kioto, and by sending their wives and families
                                to their respective provinces.</p>
                            <p>In consequence of this, therefore, it is not to be expected that they
                                should now make use of their money to purchase armaments, but we do
                                not desire that they should incur any more of these large
                                expenditures, but reduce them, and devote themselves to making
                                preparations of war, and make them effective. Also teach their
                                warriors all that is necessary to make them strong, in order that no
                                blame can be attached to their names.</p>
                            <p>Oh! the Tycoon and the large and small Daimios are all my children!
                                Let them do their best, and unite with me for the future to redress
                                mistakes hitherto committed, and not oppress their country people,
                                neither delay getting ready the necessary munitions of war, and
                                commence with zeal for the extermination of the barbarians, and not
                                forget the profession of their forefathers, which was that of
                                arms.</p>
                            <p>If they do not act as we desire them now, they shall not only offend
                                my heart, but the spirit of our ancestors shall be highly
                                displeased. And what shall the Gods of Heaven and earth then think
                                of them?</p>
                            <p>Given in the 4th year of Bunkiu, 1st month, (1864.)</p>

                            <p>The imperial will, expressed in the letter with the sight of which I
                                have been favored on the 27th of last month, was to the effect that
                                the Mikado desires to take upon his own responsibility all the
                                adversities which have happened in our illustrious country ever
                                since the accession to the throne of his ancestors; that decree has
                                really inspired me with veneration, and moved my heart even to
                                tears.</p>
                            <p>When I contemplate the errors committed by me up to this time, and
                                reflect upon my own conduct, I feel abashed at the amount of
                                transgressions I committed. Your servant Iyemochi, endowed neither
                                with skill nor genius, has, with many short-comings, served in his
                                important position, and having been unable to hold the reins of
                                government with becoming wisdom, internal and external difficulties
                                have arisen and are still continually thickening upon us. All this
                                caused much anxiety and disquietude of mind to the Mikado; because,
                                although I accepted the decree for the expulsion of the barbarians
                                last year in Kioto, I have been unable to carry it into effect up to
                                this time; neither the closing of the port of Yokohama, nor the
                                negotiations regarding it, have yet been accomplished, and it is
                                difficult to say when these matters shall come to a successful
                                end.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding that none of the orders were carried into execution,
                                I obeyed your invitation, and have appeared for a second time at
                                your court, at Kioto, expecting to find the Mikado in great anger
                                with me, and to be heaped with reproaches; but, on the contrary, I
                                am highly praised, and by a most condescending decree of the Mikado
                                your servant lyemochi’s gratitude is high as the mountains, and
                                profound as the ocean, and anything your servant can do will fall
                                immeasurably short of returning an equivalent amount of thanks for
                                such benevolent treatment as he has received at your hands.</p>
                            <p>In future we shall change the old and outgrown customs, treat the
                                Daimios like brothers, unite their hearts and arms with his, in
                                order to serve the Mikado, as a faithful servant; with the obedience
                                of a child he shall reduce in time of peace the unnecessary
                                expenditures, and carry out with zeal and ardor the military arts
                                and requisites of war. He shall put up the decaying government and
                                inspire energy into the minds of that effeminated people, and take
                                care of the coast defences near the capital, and the provinces, that
                                the foreign barbarians can no longer contemptuously play with us. He
                                shall build many ships, and cast large cannons, so that again we can
                                undertake for a second time our great object, the punishment and
                                expulsion of the barbarians from our soil, to make the glory of our
                                empire appear more and more abroad, and set the Mikado’s mind for
                                ever at rest.</p>
                            <p>He shall with great promptitude, however, obey the desire of the
                                Mikado, that the expulsion shall not be undertaken without due
                                deliberation, and I have a stratagem in view by which I shall
                                accomplish my object and be certain to gain the victory over the
                                barbarian.</p>
                            <p>In regard to the closing of the port of Yokohama, I have already sent
                                envoys to foreign countries; and although I intend to do my utmost
                                and use every endeavor, still I am ignorant of the intentions of the
                                barbarians in this matter, and, therefore, make the greatest
                                exertions to defend our sea-coast and to be at all times
                                prepared.</p>
                            <p>I have made it my duty to apply myself diligently to the military
                                tactics and the regulation of the important changes which are about
                                to take place in future, and carry them out according to the wish of
                                the Mikado, in order to encourage progress in our country, which of
                                late has fallen into disuse—to <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505"

                            <p>I honor the spirits of the ancestors of the Mikado, and act according
                                to the traditions handed down from my forefathers. This is the
                                sincere wish of your servant, Iyemochi, and is, therefore, presented
                                in answer to the Mikado’s letter.</p>

                            <p>Whereas, since the opening of the port of Kanagawa, our merchants
                                have carried on trade with foreigners, regardless of the future of
                                Japan, and have consequently caused a scarcity of the various
                                articles of daily consumption, we hereby, in order to remedy this
                                evil, call into force the order of 1860, <note n="*"
                                    xml:id="d488fn1">The order of 1860 is to the effect that the
                                    merchandise must first be brought to Yedo, to be there examined
                                    and approved for sale before it can enter Yokohama.</note>
                                wherein it was determined that silk, or any other of the five
                                articles of daily consumption, shall not be brought directly from
                                the different provinces or towns of Japan to Yokohama and sold there
                                to foreigners.</p>
                            <p>It has also come to our notice that, notwithstanding the silk produce
                                of this season has not been plentiful, many persons having only
                                their private gain in view, and indifferent to the calamities which
                                such a course of action must bring upon the whole of Japan, have
                                sent large quantities of merchandise to Yedo to he sold to
                                foreigners.</p>
                            <p>As a necessary result of such a course, articles of daily use must
                                become more and more scarce, and the prices continue to rise. It
                                will bring hard suffering upon the whole of Japan, and throw it into
                                extreme misery. All merchants, not only those of Yedo, but of the
                                whole empire, are, therefore, warned to contemplate the state of
                                things above described, and act accordingly, for the benefit of the
                                country at large.</p>

                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">From a correspondent in Yedo. His
                                    letter is dated 8th of May, 1864.</hi></p>
                            <p>On the 27th Sangwats (2d May) the steamer Shokakumaro arrived here
                                from Kioto, having on board Arima-Totomi-no-kami, a member of the
                                Gorogio, and the chief Ometske, Okubo-Bungo-no-kami; also the
                                Metske-Matsudaira-Kesaburo. The object of their visit to Yedo is
                                stated to be with the intention of entering, without delay, on the
                                negotiation with foreigners upon the subject of closing the ports,
                                which has again been determined and agreed upon at Kioto, although
                                once in Kioto the proposals of Satsuma. and Higo, for the general
                                opening of Japan, were about to be accepted. Again, this time, the
                                aspect of affairs has entirely undergone a change, and the designs
                                and intrigues of Stotsbasi appear to have gained the day.</p>
                            <p>Matsudaira-Osumi-on-kami, (Soboora,) and the prince of Etsizen,
                                amongst <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0526"/>the number of
                                Daimios who have until now stood firm in favor of a more liberal
                                policy, have retired to their own palaces under pretext of being
                                sick, (always a sign of distress.) The Daimio Matsdaira Josa has
                                gone back to his province.</p>
                            <p>The state of affairs in Kioto has caused here great excitement and
                                agitation among the Daimios, retainers, and Lonins; and the
                                mercantile part of the town is greatly disturbed, very much like the
                                consternation prevailing last year, in the winter and spring, at the
                                time the demand of the British government was put forward.</p>
                            <p>The return of the Tycoon is indefinitely delayed.</p>

                            <p>The representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France, and
                                the Netherlands, having, on the 25th day of July, 1863, declared it
                                to be indispensable to the maintenance of treaty rights that the
                                inland sea should be reopened, they announced such decision to your
                                excellencies, confidently hoping that his Majesty the Tycoon would
                                effect that object.</p>
                            <p>In this reasonable expectation they have been disappointed. The
                                Japanese government has made no reply to that communication, nor has
                                it taken any steps to put a stop to hostilities, which are still
                                threatened. It has, on the contrary, shown either its sympathy with
                                those hostile to the treaties, or its submission to their dictation,
                                by asking that the port of Kanagawa should be closed; and declared
                                that it is only on such condition that peace can be preserved.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned, having been made acquainted with the views of his
                                government in reference to this most extraordinary proposition, is
                                enabled to declare that no such concession can be made. He therefore
                                invites your excellencies to withdraw such request, in order that
                                the excitement which will naturally attend its discussion may be
                                removed.</p>
                            <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0527"/>
                            <p>In the interest of peace, he also feels it to be his duty to declare
                                that the government of his Majesty the Tycoon cannot safely rely
                                upon the further forbearance of the United States, and that it will
                                be expected to show both its willingness and ability to remove the
                                obstruction to commerce which now exists at the outlet of the inland
                                sea, and to prevent any repetition of the hostile acts of the Prince
                                of Chosen.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned considers it equally his duty to call the Serious
                                attention of the government of the Tycoon, at this moment, to the
                                great responsibilities which will inevitably fall upon them, if, as
                                the language of the ministers themselves would lead it to be
                                inferred, any violence should be offered to the foreign residents by
                                Japanese subjects, or any damage, by whomsoever inflicted, on their
                                interests, trade, or property in this country, which equally, with
                                their lives, are placed under the safeguard of treaties and of the
                                law of nations.</p>

                        <p>No. 8.—M. de Bellecourt to Mr. Pruyn.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after the troubles had arisen growing out of the British
                            demands and the British admiral had announced his inability to defend
                            this place, Admiral Jaures undertook the task, obtaining from the
                            Japanese government for that purpose a strong position on the bluff
                            commanding the town. This position is still held by the French alone,
                            though it was understood at the time it should be held jointly with the
                            British.</p>
                        <p>The arrangements between the French and British officers were made while
                            I was still at Yedo, and restored confidence to this community.</p>
                        <p>The arrest of Quartermaster West was one of those events which, while it
                            could not be justified, very naturally grew out of the exceptional
                            position of affairs.</p>
                        <p>Not feeling at liberty while our citizens were enjoying the benefits of
                            the French guard, the withdrawal of which would have been at that time
                            the cause of serious mercantile loss, (nearly all the merchants prior
                            thereto having embarked their merchandise,) to insist too rigidly on the
                            punishment of the offenders in this case at the evident risk of a
                            quarrel with my colleague of France, who showed great sensitiveness on
                            the subject, I endeavored to reconcile matters in several personal
                            conferences.</p>
                        <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0528"/>
                        <p>The order of Admiral Jaures having been issued, and security thereby
                            afforded against the repetition of such arrests and confinement, and the
                            French minister having so promptly intervened to procure West’s
                            discharge, I was still more inclined to overlook the offence, as I was
                            also satisfied West had insulted the officers, notwithstanding his
                            denial. Admiral Jaures had meanwhile left, and I was awaiting his return
                            in the confident belief that then satisfactory explanations would be
                            given, when I learned that M. de Bellecourt’s successor was daily
                            expected. I thereupon addressed a letter, (enclosure No. 7,) and
                            received his reply, (enclosure No. 8.)</p>
                        <p>I presume you will think it unnecessary to take any notice of the case.
                            Admiral Jaures is now in port with his flag-ship. But while I have
                            thought it proper to send you the papers, I think it unnecessary to
                            reopen the subject for the purpose of procuring the names of the
                            officers, as they can be obtained as readily from their government if
                            you regard the case of sufficient importance to notice it. It has
                            appeared to me one of those cases which must almost necessarily arise
                            from a <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> state of hostilities in a
                            semi-civilized country; and in the absence of all intention of insult,
                            and in view of the prompt action of the admiral to guard against future
                            cause of complaint, I have thought I could with honor refrain from
                            further insisting on the punishment of the offenders or an apology.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen</hi>: In accordance to the

                                inform you that the strictest orders have been given in all the

                                without delay, any foreign soldiers or sailors arrested through
                                urgency in the streets of the town because of creating trouble by
                                the patrols ordered on for the preservation of order in Yokohama;
                                the said patrols have orders not to arrest any foreigner without a
                                good motive, of which a detailed account will be given, certified by
                                the officers of the guard. It has also been recommended to the
                                patrols to hand the persons arrested to their own consulate, where
                                they will be delivered against a certificate from the consulate
                                employé there present. In case the person arrested cannot be handed
                                over because of the absence of the proper employes at his consulate,
                                it will be sufficient to claim him with a written paper with the
                                consular seal, or verbally by an officer of his nation in uniform.
                                In either case a detailed report on the causes of the arrest will be
                                given to the counsel or to the military authorities.</p>

                            <p>(Consular service.)</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The minister of France has authorized
                                me to reply to your letter No. 95. It is not within my province to
                                take consular action in this matter, inasmuch as it belongs to the
                                special jurisdiction of the naval and military authorities of our
                                respective countries. As it is, moreover, presented in an
                                international point of view, it became necessary, though in all
                                probability the competent naval authorities would have treated the
                                matter in a most desirable spirit of good understanding, that it be
                                presented in diplomatic course to the imperial legation by his
                                excellency the minister of the United States himself. I have,
                                therefore, the honor to transmit herewith the letter which you did
                                me the honor to write to me on the 18th instant, as my legal
                                incapacity prevents me from taking consular action in the matter in
                                question.</p>
                            <p>Please accept, sir, the assurance of my high consideration,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I regret that your excellency has not
                                been able to view the arrest of the quartermaster of the Jamestown
                                in the light in which I had the honor to present it to your
                                excellency, and in the hope that a further consideration of the case
                                may enable you to express such regret for the occurrence I deem
                                proper, I again call your attention to the principles which govern
                                the case.</p>
                            <p>1st. The arrest was made by orders of officers not on duty as
                                officers of any guard, but who were walking in the streets of
                                Yokohama, in pursuit of ordinary business or pleasure.</p>
                            <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0531"/>
                            <p>2d. The alleged offence of the quartermaster was making use of
                                insulting language. There was no such breach of the peace committed
                                as then endangered, or was likely to endanger, life or occasion
                                bodily harm or injury. As the arrest could only be for the purpose
                                of having the offender tried and punished, and the court of the
                                United States consul was the only competent civil tribunal for that
                                purpose, the officers of his Imperial Majesty should have taken the
                                proper steps to identify him when he declared he was a petty officer
                                in the United States navy, which, in this case, was very easy, in
                                consequence of his French descent and his fluent use of the
                                language, which indeed caused them at first to insist he was a
                                French subject.</p>
                            <p>3d. No officer or citizen of the United States could have arrested
                                him except on proper warrant, and no greater right can be accorded
                                to a subject of his Imperial Majesty.</p>
                            <p>4th. If arrested, he should have been taken to the United States
                                consul, whose flag was then in sight at a point nearer to the scene
                                than the French guard-house, to which he was taken and where he was
                                confined.</p>
                            <p>5th. This case undoubtedly led to the issue of the order of
                                Rear-Admiral Jaures the next day, providing that in all cases of
                                arrest by the French guard of any person not a French subject the
                                party arrested should be taken to the consul of the nationality to
                                which he belonged.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency is about retiring from your post as minister
                                plenipotentiary of his Imperial Majesty in Japan. It affords me
                                great pleasure, in the review of our personal and official
                                intercourse, that it has been uninterruptedly pleasant and cordial,
                                and I desire that our official relations shall terminate without any
                                case being left undisposed of to our mutual satisfaction. I
                                therefore simply ask that the principles of Admiral Jaures’s order
                                shall be applied to this case, and that your excellency shall
                                express your regret that the arrest has been made, and that the
                                quartermaster was confined in the French guard-house.</p>
                            <p>Should your excellency be unable to do this, you will oblige me by
                                furnishing me with the names of the officers who ordered the arrest,
                                that I may make them known to my government.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be your excellency’s most obedient, humble
                                servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: When your excellency did me the honor,
                                about six months ago, to speak to me about the temporary arrest of
                                Quartermaster West, of the Jamestown, effected by orders of French
                                officers, whom the sailor had grossly insulted, and in the French
                                language, in the main street of Yokohama, and in the presence even
                                of French soldiers, the subordinates of those officers, I hastened
                                to furnish your excellency with all the explanation it was in my
                                power to give. I communicated to you the reply of Rear-Admiral
                                Jaures to the communication which I had made him of the demand of
                                the consul of the United States on his behalf, in which reply
                                Admiral Jaures states why the arrest was made, (rudeness in public
                                towards two of his officers,) while he also shows his respect for
                                international privileges, as orders have been given to have the
                                foreigner <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0532"/>immediately
                                delivered to his own authorities as soon as claimed by them, which
                                implies that the arrest could not be regarded as a punishment, but
                                only as a pressing measure of prevention.</p>
                            <p>I have, moreover, proved already to your excellency that in this case
                                my legal capacity must give way to that of the military authority,
                                giving it as my opinion that this authority had acted in a rightful
                                and proper manner, while for myself I believed on that occasion to
                                have satisfied all international requirements, inasmuch as finding
                                myself by accident, during a walk on the evening of the occurrence,
                                (it was 6 o’clock, the arrest had taken place at half past 4
                                o’clock,) in the neighborhood of the residence of the consul of the
                                United States, and having met that functionary and learned from him
                                what had taken place, I at once dismounted to go to the consulate
                                and join an American officer of the Jamestown who was there, and to
                                guide him myself in his proceedings with the competent officers in
                                order to bring the requisite formalities for the discharge of the
                                offender to a speedy issue. My presence was useful, as the officer
                                who made the claim was not in uniform; a correspondence in writing
                                would probably have led to some more delay in the delivery of the
                                person arrested.</p>
                            <p>I am not prepared to enter with your excellency upon a full
                                discussion as to the degree of culpability of the offensive acts
                                which have caused the measure taken by the French officers on the
                                9th of August, inasmuch as my legal incapacity in this case has
                                prevented me from obtaining other data for discussion than those
                                furnished me by the Admiral Jaures, who alone has had to examine and
                                estimate the facts.</p>
                            <p>And as for that part of your excellency’s argument which establishes
                                that the arrest could be made only in order to procure the
                                repression of the act under accusation before the competent
                                authorities, I find myself, and so did the French. admiral, as shown
                                by the orders given to deliver the person arrested immediately to
                                his authorities as soon as claimed by them, in perfect harmony with
                                the principles of international law to which your excellency refers.
                                There is no doubt that, in view of those principles, Quartermaster
                                West, as soon as the report on his conduct was made out and read,
                                would have been taken in the evening on board of the Jamestown
                                either with an officer or with a letter explaining to the commander
                                of that ship the motives of the arrest. My personal intervention may
                                have shortened some delays, and led to the immediate delivery of
                                this person to the officer of the Jamestown, who claimed him and
                                received him with all the necessary verbal explanations of the
                                reasons of his temporary arrest.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency states, in the second part of the second paragraph of
                                your letter, that the French officers should have assured themselves
                                of the identity of the individual who had insulted them when he
                                declared that he was a sailor in the service of the United States,
                                because this sailor, owing to his French descent, spoke the French
                                language quite fluently.</p>
                            <p>I fear to enter too much upon the discussion of facts which it has
                                not been within my legal capacity to estimate, but in order to
                                reply, as far as lies in my power, and in courtesy to a colleague,
                                to the arguments of your excellency, I shall venture here upon the
                                expression of my personal opinion. I think from the nature of the
                                occurrence that it was rather difficult to carry out the mode of
                                proceeding indicated by your excellency in order to secure the
                                cessation of a public insult. In fact, from the moment that
                                offensive language was addressed to the French officers in French,
                                in the presence even of several soldiers, the subordinates of those
                                officers, those whom self-respect required to have that riotous
                                noise stopped could not commence a public conversation with a man
                                already excited, and who would probably have declined to comply with
                                any demand or requisition. To commence such a conversation would
                                have led to the aggravation of the improper conduct of Quartermaster
                                West. The only measure to be taken, therefore, was the forcible
                                removal of the person insulting, and placing him in safe-keeping
                                until delivery to his own authorities, and I beg <pb n="513"
                                    xml:id="pg_513" facs="0533"/>to observe that your excellency
                                yourself seems to admit an arrest in the 4th paragraph of your
                                letter, when stating that it was to the consulate of the United
                                States, and not to the French guard-house, that the delinquent
                                should have been taken for trial.</p>
                            <p>As for that part of the argument relating to the place to which the
                                delinquent should have been taken, I must observe that the officers
                                who found themselves compelled to require this arrest from that
                                moment, and according to regulations, became responsible towards
                                their superior officers for the motives of their measure, they
                                having no option whatever, as the military regulations prescribed to
                                them the duty of sending to the nearest guard-house, and to no other
                                place, and there to keep the person arrested, and to report
                                immediately to their superior officers, who alone could indicate, in
                                view of the position of the person arrested, what was to be done
                                under the circumstances. And also, the person arrested being a
                                foreign soldier or sailor, the French officers were very naturally
                                inclined to believe that their superior officers would decide that
                                this sailor was to be taken back to his military authorities. At all
                                events, it was not for them to determine to what place the person
                                arrested should be taken. Their duty was the observance of the
                                regulation and to report immediately in course of rank, (par voie
                                hierarchique,) and this was done without any delay.</p>
                            <p>Following the argument of paragraph four of your excellency’s letter,
                                I must also remark that military officers under higher command are
                                not allowed, according to regulations, to place themselves in
                                matters of duty in direct communication with authorities not
                                belonging to their department without first having been authorized
                                to that effect. No officer, therefore, could take upon himself to
                                appear without authority at a consulate or at a foreign legation, or
                                even near the civil functionaries of his nationality, without
                                incurring blame from his superiors. The military regulations thus
                                require it, and no exception could be made than by the general order
                                which the admiral commander-in-chief made known three days after the
                                occurrence of the 9th August, directing the officers or sub-officers
                                in command of the patrols to cause persons whom it became necessary
                                to arrest to be taken, <hi rend="italic">as far as feasible</hi>, to
                                their respective consulates, and only with last resort to apply the
                                usual regulation, which requires the preliminary confinement of any
                                delinquent at the nearest military guard-house until claimed by his
                                own authorities.</p>
                            <p>In a<hi rend="italic"> flagrante delicto</hi> case there is no
                                diplomatic disrespect in the arrest of a foreigner as a
                                precautionary measure; such disrespect only commences in case of
                                abuse of power, or in case of refusal to return the person arrested
                                to his own authorities.</p>
                            <p>The general order of Admiral Juares, of the 12th August, is an
                                exceptional act of courtesy, giving proof of the profound respect of
                                that general officer for international rights and privileges. But
                                this general order did not exist on the 9th of August, and the
                                French officers consequently, limited by their existing regulations,
                                could not, it seems to me, have been bound by obligations which it
                                was the object of that general order to prescribe to them for the
                                future.</p>
                            <p>From what precedes, only the <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi> of the
                                arrest would be left as matter for discussion, and I come back,
                                therefore, upon the second paragraph of the letter, which argues the
                                unimportant nature of the insult, being one in language only, and
                                not by acts or bodily harm likely to endanger life.</p>
                            <p>It seems to me that in every country any injurious act committed by a
                                military person of low or no grade towards an officer in uniform, to
                                whatever nationality he may belong, constitutes an act which
                                deserves immediate repression. Generally, and in countries having an
                                organized local police, the necessary restraint to stop a
                                disturbance and prevent the aggravation of a misdemeanor may pertain
                                to the duty as a sometimes special police; but in certain countries,
                                where the local police has no action, other means have to be used as
                                a matter of necessity, in order not to live in the midst of
                                continual disorder, and thus, in China, <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514"
                                    facs="0534"/>for instance, where, like in Japan at present,
                                several nations keep military forces for the general security, the
                                police forces, either civil or military, of several nationalities,
                                take the place of the Chinese police; and it frequently happens that
                                military foreigners, carried into excesses, find themselves arrested
                                in case of public nuisance, by the way of prevention, to be handed
                                over to their own judges on demand as speedily as possible, without
                                any such cases ever giving rise to difficulties among the respective
                                superior authorities.</p>
                            <p>Besides, the position, the honorable character, the age, and the rank
                                of the French officers who found themselves obliged to take the
                                measure of the 9th of August last, a measure which they submitted to
                                their immediate superiors, and the explanations which the French
                                admiral furnished upon taking cognizance of the facts, must be a
                                sure guarantee for your excellency that Quartermaster West, whatever
                                he may allege, has well deserved the measure of which he was the
                                object by way of prevention.</p>
                            <p>I do not know whether the personal remarks I have made will convince
                                your excellency that in the occurrence of the month of August none
                                of the French authorities has for a moment thought of willingly
                                slighting in any manner whatever the rights and privileges of
                                independence of a foreign nationality by the measure in question,
                                which unfortunately had become indispensable, there being only the
                                provoker of that occurrence to blame for it.</p>
                            <p>I desire the more to have this conviction enter your excellency’s
                                mind, as by accepting these explanations you relieve me from the
                                necessity of declining the two alternatives you propose to me.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency will readily comprehend that the act you mention not
                                having been accomplished by persons submitted to my immediate
                                jurisdiction, I can only convey all the explanations which may be
                                useful in removing the question which appears to have arisen on this
                                occasion without pronouncing upon the proceedings of another
                                jurisdiction in any other manner than may serve to render the action
                                of that jurisdiction in this instance of easy appreciation.</p>
                            <p>The second alternative proposed by your excellency could no more aid
                                in the solution of the question in the diplomatic way, inasmuch as
                                the officers who ordered the arrest of the person who insulted them
                                have been covered by the responsibility of their immediate
                                superiors.</p>
                            <p>Should, therefore, your excellency feel yourself obliged to submit
                                the question to the government of the United States, the only names
                                to appear in this international litigation would be those of
                                Rear-Admiral Jaures, commanding in chief the land and naval forces
                                in Japan, and mine, as the admiral has only called troops to
                                Yokohama in virtue of a commission (délégations) received from me to
                                that effect, a measure which has also met with the sanction of the
                                Tycoon’s government, and to which all the forces of the nations
                                represented here have associated themselves in the most perfect
                                harmony, in view of maintaining in common the order, tranquillity,
                                and trade of this settlement.</p>
                            <p>Should this incident assume the proportions of an international
                                incident, my departure from Japan would yet in no manner hamper the
                                legitimate action of our respective governments, nor could it alter
                                at all those cordial relations which have always been here of
                                general benefit, and which, if not in Japan, we may, perchance,
                                continue elsewhere.</p>
                            <p>I enclose herewith a copy of the letter of Admiral Jaures on the
                                subject of the arrest of Quartermaster West.</p>
                            <p>I avail myself of this occasion to renew to you the assurance of the
                                high consideration with which I have the honor to be your

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have now the honor to inform you that I
                            have accepted of the Japanese government the sum of $1,000 in full of
                            the indemnity I demanded for George Horton, and enclose copies of my
                            letter to the consul at Kanagawa and of his reply, enclosures Nos. 1 and
                            2, which will show the disposition made of it. The Japanese government
                            would have taken Horton back to the Bonin islands rather than pay the
                            sum of $2,000, which I demanded, and as he was unwilling to go back, and
                            he being 84 years of age, the sum will probably be sufficient to supply
                            his wants as long as he is likely to live. I thought it best to accept
                            the compromise proposed.</p>
                        <p>I would remark in this connexion that the Japanese colony has been
                            withdrawn from the islands, as stated by governors for foreign affairs,
                            though I have had no official notification of their abandonment.</p>
                        <p>When the demand for indemnity for the firing of the legation was
                            presented, I was first met by the declaration that I had immediately
                            after the fire declared my belief that it was entirely accidental.</p>
                        <p>Such was the construction they affected to put on my remark, that I
                            desired, for my sake and for the sake of my government and of their
                            government, to believe such to be the fact. As this conversation was
                            held in advance of any investigation, the government knows it was simply
                            impossible I would so commit myself.</p>
                        <p>In two subsequent interviews, what purported to be a Japanese version of
                            a portion of my letter was produced, which represented me as saying that
                            the President was satisfied the Japanese government had caused the
                            legation to be destroyed. This was the construction they pretended to
                            put upon that portion of my letter in which I quote your language. I
                            refer to this that you may understand what I had in view when I
                            addressed to the ministers for foreign affairs my letter of the 24th May
                            last, (54,) copy of which I now enclose, No. 3, and which I wrote after
                            I found they persisted in such construction, notwithstanding my verbal
                            denial that there was any language used which would justify it. I also
                            enclose, No. 4, copy of the answer of the ministers for foreign affairs,
                            and, No. 5, copy of my reply, and also No. 6, copy of a letter which I
                            transmitted after the receipt of your No. 63, of the 18th March
                            last.</p>
                        <p>A few days after, two assistant ministers for foreign affairs waited upon
                            my colleagues and myself on business connected with our note identique.
                            At the close of the conference with myself several governors for foreign
                            affairs remained in the room, and stated they had been ordered by the
                            vice-ministers to make a communication to me. They proceeded to say that
                            the government had been surprised at my letter of the 11th June,
                            (enclosure No. 5, above mentioned.) I said I had reason to be surprised
                            at their summary rejection of my proposal for further friendly efforts
                            to arrive at a settlement. To this they replied that the letter to me
                            had assented to such conference, and that they had been appointed to
                            meet me for that purpose. I told them I was glad to hear this, though
                            the letter of the ministers was precisely the reverse of what they
                            stated it to be. They said there must be some error in the translation;
                            and though I offered to send for the letter to show its true character,
                            they said it was unnecessary, as they had a copy at Yedo.</p>
                        <p>The hour of 10 p. m. having arrived, I said it was too late to enter upon
                            the subject then, and that I was willing to meet them next day. They
                            replied that they would report to the Gorogio what I had said, and see
                            me on some subsequent day.</p>
                        <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0536"/>
                        <p>There is a manifest desire on the part of the government to delay as long
                            as possible any settlement. I have determined to proceed to Yedo to
                            defeat such design, and will in another communication make known the
                            result. The proposition has thrown the government into a state of
                            excitement and even of consternation, particularly as I propose to land
                            a guard from the Jamestown, in view of their official declaration that
                            they cannot guarantee my safety.</p>
                        <p>I hope soon to bring the government to terms.</p>
                        <p>I now enclose papers upon which the claims for indemnity to citizens of
                            the United States at this place are founded, as follows: Nos. 7, 8, 9,
                            10, and 11. I have long since made known their substance to you, but
                            have thought it well to place copies of these papers on file in the
                            department.</p>
                        <p>The claims presented are unanswerably just. The Japanese government have
                            failed to give a satisfactory answer and to exonerate itself from blame.
                            The letter of the ministers, the attitude of the government, and the
                            events of the past year, combine to make it still more impossible for
                            them to do so.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You will please receive of the
                                Japanese government the sum of one thousand Mexican dollars, paid on
                                my demand, as an indemnity for George Horton, an aged seaman of the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>As he is more than 84 years of age, I suppose that in all human
                                probability the above sum, carefully husbanded, may suffice for his
                                future support, without making him a burden on the United States
                                government.</p>
                            <p>You will, therefore, place the same safely at interest, so as to
                                produce at least 12 per cent. per annum, and appropriate the
                                interest and so much of the principal as from time to time may be
                                necessary for his support. I shall advise Horton that he will be
                                allowed, by will or other instrument in writing, to indicate the
                                disposition of any balance which may remain at the time of his
                                death, after paying the expenses of his funeral.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that the
                            American steamer Monitor, on the 19th July, entered one of the ports of
                            the Prince of Choshu, on the western coast of the province of Nagato,
                            and was fired at by one of his batteries.</p>
                        <p>The letter of the United States consul at Nagasaki and the protest of the
                            officers of the steamer sufficiently set forth the facts.</p>
                        <p>I received the copies of the letters while at Yedo, and immediately had a
                            conference with governors for foreign affairs sent to me for that
                            purpose by the ministers. The original letters in the overland mail
                            despatched by the governor of Nagasaki did not reach me till the evening
                            before my departure from Yedo, The Japanese governors very properly
                            asked me to wait till they had received letters from the governor of
                            Nagasaki, before entering further into the consideration of the subject,
                            engaging, however, to make a speedy and satisfactory settlement of the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>I made no claim, nor do I feel disposed to make any in favor of the
                            owners of the vessel, one of whom was on board at the time.</p>
                        <p>While I have no reason to distrust the truth of the declarations that
                            they were destitute of coal, and that they were obliged to go into the
                            harbor, I cannot forget that while here in 1863 the same vessel entered
                            a port in the territories of Satsuma; and it would be unwise to
                            encourage owners of vessels brought to this country for sale to enter
                            the ports of hostile Daimios, or any ports not open to trade.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                            <p>In two interviews which I have had with the governors for foreign
                                affairs, Takemoto Hayato-no-kami and Takemoto Kai-no-kami, my
                                attention has been called to the Japanese version of that portion of
                                my letter presenting the demands my government has instructed me to
                                make on the government of his Majesty the Tycoon, which relates to
                                the destruction by fire of the legation buildings at Yedo.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to say that the translation as explained by these
                                governors is entirely inaccurate; and I now reiterate the views of
                                the President, in order to remove any unpleasantness which may have
                                been occasioned by such mistake. The President does not impute to
                                the Japanese government any complicity in that destruction at the
                                time of its occurrence, or any knowledge that it was to be effected;
                                but he does believe that the same hostile feelings which occasioned
                                the destruction of the British legation at Groten Yama, the murder
                                of the guards at the British legation at Tosenji, and which in June,
                                according to the declaration of the government of his Majesty the
                                Tycoon, prompted the assemblage of Lronins at Yedo for the purpose
                                of attacking the American minister at his temporary residence,
                                effected the destruction of the legation buildings, a week before
                                the latter conspiracy, and he thinks that this should have been
                                foreseen and prevented by the government.</p>
                            <p>Your excellencies will perceive that such a conclusion, while not
                                unreasonable in itself, does no injustice and imputes no wrong to
                                the Japanese government.</p>
                            <p>But, while the Japanese government is not censured for these acts, it
                                is proper that it should indemnify the government of the United
                                States for a loss sustained, while its minister was reposing on the
                                fidelity and vigilance of Japanese guards. And whether the fire was
                                occasioned by the guilt of one or more of the guards conniving with
                                the hostile party, as was the case at Tosenji, or by their want of
                                vigilance, the claim is equally just. Nor is it less just if the
                                views of the government be correct and the fire took place
                                accidentally.</p>
                            <p>Your excellencies will bear in mind that the American minister had no
                                foreign guards. The fire originated in one of the guards’ houses or
                                in the kitchen adjoining it, which of the two the undersigned does
                                not know; nor is it material, as none of his private Japanese
                                servants were there at the time. If the fire was accidental it arose
                                on the premises, and the Japanese government should make good the
                                loss sustained by the acts or earlessness of its own agents.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned makes these remarks in the sincere hope that the
                                government of his Majesty the Tycoon will see their way clear to pay
                                at once the indemnity asked, as it can do so with perfect honor.</p>
                            <p>If your excellencies will cause the same governors to have another
                                interview with me I hope we can arrive at an amicable settlement. It
                                would be a shame if this could not be done by two nations, both of
                                whom must be desirous of acting justly. The United States will never
                                ask of Japan what it would not be prepared to grant under similar
                                circumstances.</p>
                            <p>With respect and esteem,</p>

                            <p>We received your letter No. 54, dated the 24th May, and understand
                                all you stated in relation to the fire at Drenf-Kujee.</p>
                            <p>As your excellency, according to your letter, wishes to confer in a
                                friendly manner with Takemoto Hayato-no-kami and Takemoto
                                Kai-no-kami on this subject, we would send them to you, but in your
                                letter it is mentioned that it is uncertain whether the fire
                                originated in the guard-house or in the kitchen adjoining it.</p>
                            <p>Through Ogasawara Setti-no-kami we already gave you full information
                                on the subject, and you have also well understood that the fire
                                originated in the kitchen; and while informing your government of
                                the faithful manner in which the officers on duty acquitted
                                themselves, you stated, nevertheless, that you wanted to know all
                                the circumstances fully. We held a strict investigation and informed
                                you of the result in writing. Wherefore we believed that you fully
                                understood it all. Afterwards you stated, however, that you had a
                                communication to make to us. Wherefore we sent Hayato-no-kami and
                                Kai-no-kami to you, who on several occasions conferred with you on
                                the subject, and it cannot now be admitted by us what you stated, as
                                the place where the fire originated is not known with certainty. It
                                is desirable, therefore, that you will take this into consideration
                                in connexion with your former impression.</p>
                            <p>Which we have to state in reply, with respect and esteem.</p>

                                he made known to me the approval of the President of the United

                                1863, the Secretary of State says that the President hopes, and
                                indeed confidently expects, that these claims have already been

                                learn that your excellencies are so little inclined to reciprocate
                                his friendly feelings as to have rejected, without even a word of
                                regret or excuse, my suggestions for further conferences, through
                                which I confidently hoped and believed an amicable understanding
                                would result.</p>
                            <p>I will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that the relations
                                of the two countries have not been disturbed by my unwillingness to
                                consider patiently and calmly the questions at issue, nor by my
                                failure to show all the forbearance towards the government of his
                                Majesty the Tycoon, in the difficult position it now occupies, which
                                is consistent with my duty to my government in maintaining its

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to inform you that this morning
                                six or seven Japanese entered my dwelling house and attacked me
                                while dressing. They robbed me of my watch and jewelry about my
                                person, and carried me down into the swamps behind my house, with
                                the intention, as I thought, of killing me, but I was rescued by the
                                presence of Mr. Allmand and Captain Walsh, together with several of
                                the English guards stationed at the new consulate. Thinking myself
                                no longer safe, I have abandoned the house to the Japanese
                                government.</p>

                            <p>Be it remembered, that on the day and date above mentioned personally
                                came before me the undersigned, S. Robertson, who, being duly sworn,
                                on his oath deposes and says, that on the morning of the 6th
                                instant, between the hours of 9 and 10 o’clock, six or seven
                                Japanese men, headed by a merchant named San-oriah, entered in and
                                upon his premises, and into his dwelling-house, and then and there,
                                while he was dressing, by force of arms, seized, took and carried
                                the said Robertson out of his house, and violently, forcibly, and
                                against his will and consent, abducted and carried him away, and
                                were proceeding with him, by the back way of his lot, towards what
                                is called the swamp or low ground, in the rear of the foreign
                                settlement, as he believes, to drown or kill him; that while doing
                                this, his arms were pinioned and bruised, and he was <pb n="521"
                                    xml:id="pg_521" facs="0541"/>violently choked by the said
                                abductors, and at the same time one man walked behind him, holding
                                over his head a double-headed barbed hook, such as the Japanese
                                police use in catching thieves and other felons. And affiant further
                                says that he knows no cause for any such proceeding, and that no
                                authority whatever existed for, or could be or was pretended to be
                                shown, for such highhanded outrage upon his person.</p>
                            <p>Affiant further states, that when near to the British consulate and
                                new jail buildings his cries attracted the British guard there
                                stationed, when Sergeant Simeon Lawrence and two privates, of her
                                Britannic Majesty’s 61st foot, Lieutenant Price commanding, cams to
                                his relief and rescue. About the same time, also, Mr. John Allmand,
                                an American citizen, and Captain Walsh, also an American citizen,
                                arrived and assisted him, the said Japanese escaping and running
                                away.</p>
                            <p>Affiant further swears, that on his return to his house he found his
                                watch and chain, worth seventy-five ($75) dollars, his sleeve
                                buttons, worth seven ($7) to ten ($10) dollars, and seven ($7)
                                dollars in Mexicans, taken from his pockets and person. Also, that
                                all his household servants, being frightened, had left and gone to
                                parts unknown, and not one of whom has yet returned.</p>
                            <p>Affiant further says, that the only cause of difference that could
                                exist between the said leader, San-o-riah, and himself was, so far
                                as he is aware, in relation to a small mercantile balance of,
                                perhaps, thirty ($30) to forty ($40) dollars on a running account,
                                unadjusted and unsettled, and which, when settled and agreed upon,
                                he was ready on demand to pay.</p>
                            <p>Affiant further swears, that no demand was made upon him for any sum
                                of money whatever, and that this gross and unwarrantable violence,
                                assault, and abduction were an outrage upon his person and rights,
                                sacredly guaranteed to him, under and by virtue of the existing
                                treaties between the United States of America and Japan.</p>

                                of the 6th instant he heard cries and shouts of a man, and going out
                                from the station, the British new consular buildings and jail, he
                                saw a crowd of he thinks near a dozen Japanese around a foreigner,
                                who was found to be an American citizen, Mr. S. Robertson; that said
                                Japanese were forcibly taking and carrying him away; that with two
                                men he proceeded and rescued Mr. Robertson; that when he did so, Mr.
                                Robertson’s shirt was torn and hanging down around his legs, and he
                                had no coat, vest, or hat on, and one of the Japanese had holding
                                over him an iron hook, or hatchet-like instrument; that a part of
                                the Japanese ran away, but no arrests were made, as Mr. Robertson
                                knew the men, and said he would make complaint, and have an officer
                                make the necessary arrests through the American consul.</p>

                            <p>On this day and year above written personally appeared before me John
                                Allmand, an American citizen, who, having duly sworn on his oath,
                                deposes and says that on the 6th instant, between the hours of nine
                                and ten o’clock a. m., hearing the cries of a man in distress, he
                                immediately ran out of his house, No. 93, and in the rear could just
                                see a man being carried away by several Japanese; that he followed
                                to render such relief as possible, and was accompanied by Captain
                                Walsh, late of the American bark Rover; and that as soon as he had
                                reached the street he saw it was Mr. S. Robertson, and that just
                                then three men of her Britannic Majesty’s 67th regiment had reached
                                Mr. Robertson; also Mr. Corns, of Aspenall, Corus &amp; Co., he
                                believes; and altogether they rescued Mr. Robertson; that Mr.
                                Robertson appeared greatly distressed, and had only his shirt and
                                pantaloons on, the former garment all torn and dangling round his
                                legs; also that he had no hat on, and appeared badly frightened, and
                                said he believed he was going to be killed. Affiant further swears
                                that they let the Japanese go, those that did not run away, as he
                                and Mr. Robertson knew the leaders, and they saw a large crowd
                                gathering near, undoubtedly intending to reattack Mr. Robertson or
                                to rescue such of the abductors as we might attempt to secure.
                                Affiant also believed them too poorly armed to resist an attack from
                                the Japanese in such force as seemed to be gathering. Affiant
                                farther swears that about 4½ p. m. the same day, on the main street
                                of Yokohama, and within five minutes after meeting, the United
                                States consul related this fact to him, viz: that the leader,
                                San-o-riah, he, this affiant, had just met on the street,
                                notwithstanding, as he heard from the consul, that the governor had
                                said the said San-o-riah was in custody and should be retained until
                                a fair hearing of Mr. Robertson could be had; that this affiant
                                could not be mistaken in his identity. Mr. Allmand further swears
                                that within the past three days he has twice met the same man on the
                                public street in Yokohama unattended by any officer or person
                                whatever on either of said occasions.</p>

                            <p>On this day and year above written personally appeared before me the
                                undersigned, Raphael Schoyer, who being by me duly sworn, on his
                                oath doth depose and say that on the morning of the 6th instant,
                                between the hours of seven and eight o’clock, a large party of
                                Japanese coolies, carpenters, and other laboring men, numbering not
                                less than one hundred to one hundred and <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523"
                                    facs="0543"/>twenty-five men, came to and surrounded his house,
                                and entered his yard and halls, filling the same, and in a riotous,
                                loud, and violent manner demanded of him the payment of eleven
                                hundred (1,100) itzibus, immediately threatening his person and
                                property unless their demand was complied with; that they claimed
                                said sum for work and labor done, and materials furnished, for
                                buildings then in the course of construction by this affiant; that
                                this affiant then and there remonstrated with and warned the leaders
                                that they were doing wrong; that by his agreement he owed them
                                nothing; that they then consulted and reduced their claim to three
                                hundred (300) itzibus; that this affiant still declined payment, but
                                said to them “There is my money,” pointing to his safe, “and if you
                                mean to rob me take the money; you are the strongest—I am weak;”
                                that the said leaders then insisted on the payment of the said last
                                sum, and this affiant, under their threats and to save the life of
                                his wife, self, and property, then paid the said three hundred (300)
                                itzibus as demanded. That this affiant believes, had he not have
                                complied with this demand, his wife and son in the adjoining room,
                                as well as himself and his house and property, would have been in
                                the greatest peril, if not totally destroyed.</p>
                            <p>Affiant further swears that he was in truth and in fact not indebted
                                to these men; that he paid his laborers and carpenters every night,
                                and that the whole attack was unprovoked by him and without any real
                                cause whatever, and an outrage upon his person, his property, and
                                his sacred rights as a citizen of the United States, by virtue of
                                the treaty between the United States of America and Japan.</p>

                            <p>On this day and year above written personally appeared before me, the
                                under signed, John O. P. Stearns, who, being first duly sworn,
                                deposes and says, that on the morning of the 5th instant, between
                                the hours of 7 and 8 o’clock, a large number of Japanese coolies and
                                laborers, numbering from 125 to 150, came into his enclosure and
                                compound, and, with threats of violence and destruction, and loud
                                and unusual noises, expressed their intention to tear down the
                                garden fences and house; that immediately his household servants
                                came to and awakened him with the above intelligence, and to leave,
                                or he would be killed; that he then hurriedly arose, and taking his
                                double-barrelled fowling-piece proceeded to the door of his house
                                and warned them to leave; that at once they set up loud shouts of
                                derision and threats, and with brandished poles and clubs refused to
                                leave; that this affiant then went out to reason with or drive them
                                away, holding in his left hand his gun, not offering or intending to
                                use the same except in self-defence; that on approaching the
                                ringleader, a man to whom he was indebted in a balance of $110 for
                                work and labor done, and whom he had never refused to pay, his gun
                                was knocked out of his hand, he himself was knocked down by a
                                violent blow on the head, and then and there kicked, bruised, and
                                trampled upon, and would, in all human probability, and he believes,
                                have been immediately killed but for the intervention and
                                faithfulness of his domestics, who at once flew to his rescue, and
                                who, by united and powerful efforts, succeeded in rescuing him and
                                getting him into his house again, seriously but not dangerously
                                wounded.</p>
                            <p>Affiant further says, that, by the warning and threats then made, his
                                servants left his house and employ, and have not since returned, and
                                he believes dare not <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0544"
                                />return; and further, that it is dangerous for him to remain in his
                                said house alone, and that he cannot do so without his said
                                servants; and that this gross and unprovoked assault and violence
                                upon him was without just cause, and an outrage upon his person and
                                property under and by virtue of treaty and other rights existing
                                between the United States of America and Japan.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your excellency has already been
                                informed of the circumstances and facts concerning the late brutal
                                attack upon my person by a number of Japanese subjects, headed by a
                                merchant named San-o-riah.</p>
                            <p>I now avail myself of this opportunity to acquaint your excellency
                                that the said merchant is still within the settlement, and yesterday
                                I met him in the streets of the foreign quarter.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese authorities, apparently, have taken no cognizance of the
                                matter, which may induce the man to make a similar attempt, which
                                might compel me to resort to such measures, in self-defence, as
                                would be serious, and which I would wish to avoid. I am confirmed in
                                this belief, as I have been informed by an English gentleman that he
                                met this San-o-riah near the gate of my residence, and he
                                (San-o-riah) told him that he was there for the purpose of waylaying
                                me. This fact can be substantiated by the deposition of this English
                                gentleman.</p>
                            <p>If this outrage is allowed to pass unnoticed by the Japanese
                                authorities, it appears to me that other Japanese may be tempted to
                                make similar attacks upon foreigners resident at this port.</p>
                            <p>This communication is respectfully submitted for your excellency’s
                                consideration.</p>

                            <p>We recently replied to your letter, No. 136, of December 21, and as
                                we then stated, in regard to the matters relating to Yokohama,
                                referred to in that reply, we instructed the governors of Kanagawa
                                to make a full statement on the subject.</p>
                            <p>As for the time at which the governors came to the custom-house, and
                                the absence during the disturbance which took place at Yokohama,
                                this was for necessary reasons, and your excellency has not well
                                understood this; hence your mistake in our opinion, as you omitted
                                fully to ascertain this.</p>
                            <p>And as for Robertson and the two other persons, the governors know
                                fully well all that relates thereto, and we have learned it from
                                them from the beginning to end. Taking into consideration all that
                                your excellency and the governors have said on that subject, it is
                                suspected that there must be some difference in the manner of
                                representing between the governors and the consul.</p>
                            <p>We have, therefore, again instructed the governors to come to an
                                understanding on the facts, and request your excellency to cause the
                                consul again to confer with them on the subject. In this manner the
                                circumstances of these matters <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525"
                                    facs="0545"/>will become clear and evident, and your doubt will
                                be removed. And for the purpose of further consideration we transmit
                                herewith abstract of the statement made to us by the governors.</p>
                            <p>With respect and esteem.</p>

                                        governors of Kanagawa.</hi></p>
                                <p>We have read the translation of the letter of the American
                                    minister relating to Kanagawa matters.</p>
                                <p>The governors of Kanagawa usually come to the custom-house at 10
                                    o’clock; but when Asano Ega-no kami was governor he had no
                                    colleagues, being the only governor here, and he had personally
                                    to examine civil and criminal cases, passing sentence, &amp;c.,
                                    at his official residence, which delayed his appearance at the
                                    custom-house until after 12 o’clock.</p>
                                <p>The minister has not taken into consideration the circumstances
                                    under which the disturbance in Yokohama arose and public feeling
                                    was tranquillized, wherefore it is unnecessary for us to write
                                    again on that subject.</p>
                                <p>Having fully examined ail that relates to two Americans,
                                    Robertson and Stearns, and another foreigner called Scoyer, (but
                                    there is no foreigner of the name of Scoyer, though there is, we
                                    heard, an American merchant of some such name,) we now state as
                                    follows:</p>
                                <p>Upon receiving the statement of the American consul that some
                                    persons had violently demanded the payment of a debt of the
                                    American merchant, Robertson; had forcibly carried him off,
                                    beaten him, and robbed him of his watch, the jewelry about his
                                    person, clothes, dollars, and other things, we made inquiry, and
                                    found that Naorke, a servant of Suihatshiro, living in Momatshi,
                                    Fifth street, Yokohama, had sold to Robertson, in the eighth
                                    month of last year, (October, 1862,) bocurio (article of food)
                                    and sea-weed, receiving two hundred dollars from him on account.
                                    When Naorke afterwards applied for the balance due, Robertson
                                    wanted to buy potatoes and shark fins, upon delivery of which he
                                    would pay up on both accounts. Naorke delivered the merchandise
                                    desired, but received only one hundred dollars. After repeated
                                    applications for the balance, Robertson paid one hundred dollars
                                    in the first month of this year, (February, 1863;) but there
                                    remained a balance of something over $422 50, and though
                                    repeatedly applied to for the balance, yet Robertson did not
                                    pay.</p>
                                <p>During the third month of the year (April, 1863) the disturbance
                                    arose in Yokohama, and the owners of the goods, who had
                                    delivered them to Naorke on trust, strongly urged him to pay
                                    them; but he could not satisfy them, and was compelled on the
                                    ninth day of the month to take them with him to Robertson, who
                                    did not pay his debt. But Robertson became angry, was very
                                    uncivil to them, and, moreover, kicked Naorke down. Naorke,
                                    however, caught the foot of Robertson and upset him. Robertson
                                    got up and threatened to take a pistol from his bed, at which
                                    moment Naorke, with the owners, took hold of Robertson. As in
                                    front the houses of the foreign merchants line the streets, they
                                    took him out through the rear of his house into the street,
                                    Otamatshi, leading to the custom-house. When back of the house
                                    of the American merchant, Wartman, <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526"
                                        facs="0546"/>(Allmand,) Robertson cried out loud, and
                                    Allmand came out at once, and with the request that Robertson be
                                    delivered up to him, they complied, and went home.</p>
                                <p>The foregoing was stated to us by Naorke and the owners of the
                                    goods, and we have again examined them and asked if they had
                                    beaten Robertson, and stolen his watch, jewelry, and dollars,
                                    upon which they replied they had committed no such crime, but
                                    that no doubt Robertson would like to fasten crime upon them,
                                    and they hoped that we would advise Robertson to pay the debt
                                    due them.</p>
                                <p>Asano Ega-no-kami then said to the consul that Robertson should
                                    at all events pay his debt, and he would then suitably punish
                                    Naorke and the owners of the goods according to our laws,
                                    expecting from the consul that he would properly punish
                                    Robertson for what he had done. Afterwards, at the interview on
                                    the 19th of the fourth month between Ega-no-kami and the
                                    minister and consul, they insisted that Robertson had not kicked
                                    Naorke down, and they would write to their government about the
                                    punishment of Naorke if not punished to their entire
                                    satisfaction. But it is impossible, on application of the
                                    minister, to alter our criminal laws, which was fully
                                    stated.</p>
                                <p>The letter of the consul was answered with the same statement as
                                    that made at the conference, and since our reply, dated the 23d
                                    day of the ninth month, nothing further has been said on the
                                    same subject.</p>
                                <p>According to the statement of the American consul, Japanese
                                    coolies have violently claimed the payment of a debt from
                                    Stearns, an American merchant, beaten him, and broken his
                                    musket; but from strict investigation it appears that Sakitshi,
                                    a coolie master, living in the village of Tshikawamura, had
                                    fulfilled his contract for levelling the lot of Stearns in the
                                    rear of the house, for which work $150 was to be paid, he having
                                    received forty dollars in advanee.</p>
                                <p>The contract was fulfilled, and the balance due him claimed, but
                                    under various pretexts no satisfaction was given. During the
                                    third month the town was in confusion, and public feeling much
                                    unsettled, and the coolies clamored for their wages, and on the
                                    13th day of that month he was compelled to go with them to
                                    Stearns’s house and claim the payment of the debt. But Stearns
                                    became angry, and levelled his musket with intent to shoot them,
                                    and, as a matter of course, Sakitshi took the musket from him
                                    and broke it. At that moment the servant and the groom of
                                    Stearns intervened, desired them to be quiet, declaring that
                                    they would see to the debt of Stearns being paid in full.
                                    Sakitshi trusted in that declaration, and withdrew with his
                                    coolies. On the same day Osano Ega-no-kami looked into the
                                    matter; but it was only on the 19th day that the American consul
                                    proposed that the broken musket should be paid for, to which
                                    Asano replied that it could not be paid according to the laws,
                                    and this Sakitshi could not be punished according to law unless
                                    Stearns first paid the balance of $110 due from him. The consul
                                    agreed to this, promising to pay that amount on the 20th
                                    day.</p>
                                <p>Afterwards, at the interview with the said consul on the 29th day
                                    of the fourth month, Asano asked about the payment, and why it
                                    had not yet been made; but though the consul had before assured
                                    that he would cause Stearns to pay that debt, he then covered
                                    the matter, because Stearns had said that, in view of the
                                    breaking of the musket, it was difficult to pay that money. He
                                    then returned to his residence, and we heard nothing further on
                                    the subject.</p>
                                <p>That at the house of Schoyer, an American merchant, many Japanese
                                    had collected to violently claim money due from him, and had
                                    taken three hundred itsibus from him, was made known to us by
                                    the said consul. Wherefore, investigating this, we came to the
                                    result as follows:</p>
                                <p>Tatrogoro, a builder, residing in the first street of Otamatshi,
                                    in the ninth month of last year, agreed to build the house of
                                    Schoyer on condition that wages were to be paid daily, and there
                                    was no contract in writing. Owing to <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527"
                                        facs="0547"/>Tatrogoro being confined to his house by
                                    illness since the spring, and being much worse during the third
                                    month, the wages due accumulated to 137½ rios, (550 itsibus.)
                                    The men got no money, Tatrogoro’s illness preventing him from
                                    asking for it. The town then being in confusion, all the men
                                    claimed their wages. From and under such pressure he came with
                                    all the workmen to Schoyer’s house, claimed the money, and
                                    received 75 rios, (300 itsibus,) thinking to receive the balance
                                    at some other time.</p>
                                <p>We suspected that many of these workmen coming to Schoyer might
                                    have made free to help themselves to money, and carefully
                                    investigating this, he said that no such thing was done; but
                                    Schoyer, fearing the crowd, gave him part of the sum due, and
                                    did so in view of the many assembled, though no violent language
                                    was used.</p>
                                <p>Our officers communicated the foregoing to the consul, but we
                                    heard nothing further on the subject. All these matters shall be
                                    taken up separately when he will bring them before us; and we
                                    are awaiting your further instructions. In the letter received
                                    from you it is mentioned that one of the guilty persons has been
                                    sentenced to take charge of the sewerage of this town, but this
                                    is not so.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose, No. 1, a copy
                            of the translation of the letter of the Gorogio in answer to the note
                                <hi rend="italic">identique</hi> addressed to them on the 30th of
                            May last, of which I enclosed you a copy in my despatch, No. 39, of that
                            date.</p>
                        <p>Immediately on its receipt the representatives of the treaty powers met,
                            and after considering the reply, agreed with entire unanimity upon the
                            memorandum of which I now enclose copy, enclosure No. 2.</p>
                        <p>Further action has been suspended in consequence of the arrival at this
                            port of two young men, retainers of the Prince of Choshu, who were in
                            England, pursuing their studies, and who thought their representations
                            and remonstrances might cause that prince to refrain from further
                            hostilities.</p>
                        <p>On my visit to this place, for the purpose of meeting my colleagues, I
                            found they had prepared memoranda for presentation by these young men to
                            that prince, and in the brief time allowed me I prepared a short
                            memorandum for like presentation, a copy of which I now enclose,
                            (enclosure No. 3.) I also send a Japanese version, kindly provided for
                            me by order of Sir Rutherford Alcock.</p>
                        <p>The British frigates Borussa and Cormorant, despatched to the inland sea,
                            returned this day. On their arrival near the territory of the Prince of
                            Choshu they landed his retainers, who returned, after an absence of
                            eleven days, with a verbal answer, that he was acting under the orders
                            of the Mikado; but if time was given, the Mikado might be induced to
                            revoke his orders, and he, Choshu, would so advise him.</p>
                        <p>An impression, however, was left on the minds of the British officers and
                            interpreters that the answer was much softened down by these young
                            men.</p>
                        <p>During their absence the ships were engaged in surveying, with a view of
                            testing the accuracy of the charts, which were found quite reliable.
                            While engaged in these labors one of the ships approached, on two
                            different occasions, the entrance of the straits, and shots were both
                            times fired across her bows. The captain of the Borussa informs me that
                            the guns were fixed, and he was not within their range. The steamer,
                            agreeably to instructions, did not fire on the batteries.</p>

                            <p>We have received your letter, No. 58, of the 30th May, and fully
                                understood all that you, according to the views of your government,
                                stated therein relating to the firing, last year, upon foreign ships
                                in Nagato, and to the closing of the port of Kanagawa.</p>
                            <p>We have not neglected this Nagato matter, as the members of the 2d
                                council, Suwa Inaba-no-kami and Matrudaira Nui-no-kami stated to you
                                under our instructions. Should this, however, be too hastily
                                proceeded with, a satisfactory solution of all matters would not be
                                attained, owing to great trouble which may arise from the want of
                                harmony in public feeling, and which, it is feared, may bring about
                                a rupture of the friendly relations between the two countries. It
                                requires time to carry out the arrangement, and the requisite steps
                                must be taken gradually, as we have such profound apprehensions as
                                stated above. We therefore request that this matter, for the
                                present, may be left for us to manage.</p>
                            <p>Your suspecting us of sympathy with those who are hostile to the
                                treaties, because we asked for the closing of the port of Kanagawa,
                                surprised us greatly. We caused our embassy last year fully to
                                explain the state of affairs, which, in good faith, has ever since
                                been the subject of profound deliberation by our government, but
                                this (self-management by degrees) is the only means of
                                tranquillizing the public feeling, and removing the obstructions
                                injurious to the relations between the two countries; it is,
                                therefore, desirable that your excellency will understand this well,
                                and kindly will take care, in order that the mutual relations of
                                friendship be made lasting.</p>
                            <p>Which we have to state in reply.</p>

                            <p>When the treaty powers, in 1862, consented, on the representations of
                                the Tycoon’s envoys, to certain important modifications in the
                                treaties, the spirit, the motive, and the extent of these
                                concessions were clearly set forth.</p>
                            <p>In consenting to the deferred opening of the ports mentioned in the
                                memorandum signed at the time, the treaty powers were careful to
                                establish the fact that this postponement, far from signifying a
                                virtual abandonment of their rights, <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529"
                                    facs="0549"/>was, on the contrary, to foe taken as indicating
                                their firm resolution to maintain them, by furnishing the Tycoon
                                with the means which he declared to be necessary for securing them
                                in a more effectual manner.</p>
                            <p>In a word, the Japanese government, by the very tenor of those
                                representations, pledged itself to remove, in exchange for these
                                temporary concessions, all the difficulties of the time, and
                                solemnly promised to remove the obstacles which might oppose the
                                development of our relations.</p>
                            <p>But what have been the results of these promises and concessions?</p>
                            <p>The undersigned summed them up when last year, in the month of July,
                                they addressed to the Tycoon an identical note describing the
                                restrictions placed upon commerce, the murderous assaults committed
                                upon foreigners, the closing of the inland sea, and the attacks made
                                upon several foreign vessels by a Daimio.</p>
                            <p>These complaints remained unanswered; no steps were taken to give
                                redress; and as the situation became worse, because the presence of
                                foreigners at Yokohama was put in question, the undersigned were
                                compelled to renew their remonstrances in a note which they
                                addressed, on the 30th of May last, to the Gorogio.</p>
                            <p>As the Yedo council has not this time thought it advisable to be
                                silent regarding this step, the undersigned have met together in
                                order to examine the tenor of the reply to the aforesaid note,
                                received by them separately, and to fix upon the line of conduct to
                                be followed upon this occasion.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned satisfied themselves that the reply from the Gorogio
                                was identical, and virtually a negation of all their
                                reclamations.</p>
                            <p>In effect, while deploring the violent acts of the Daimio, who, after
                                having closed the inland sea, still obstructs and interrupts the
                                commerce of Nagasaki, the Japanese ministers leave the undersigned
                                no hope of this state of things being modified, and warn them,
                                moreover, of the dangers which the treaty powers may incur in
                                attempting to arrive at that end by direct and common action.</p>
                            <p>As for the port of Yokohama, the Gorogio continues in the same
                                course, and persists in demanding the abandonment of that settlement
                                as a necessity urged upon it by circumstances, and as the only means
                                of securing the lives of foreigners and the peace of the
                                country.</p>
                            <p>In face of this categoric declaration, the undersigned are compelled
                                to seek elsewhere for the means of obtaining redress for existing
                                grievances, and of protecting, as effectually as possible, the
                                interests intrusted to them.</p>
                            <p>And first, they inquire, what is the political situation of
                                Japan?</p>
                            <p>Authentic documents, derived from various sources, disperse the
                                darkness with which the local government endeavors to obscure
                                it.</p>
                            <p>The Tycoon, by treating with foreigners on a footing of equality, has
                                hurt the national pride of the Daimios, while he has damaged their
                                interests by reserving to himself the monopoly of our new commercial
                                relations.</p>
                            <p>To these first causes of the discontent of the Daimios have soon been
                                added the increase of taxes and other exactions, imposed on them
                                under the pretext of providing for the defence of the country.</p>
                            <p>This hostile attitude has been the more clearly defined from the
                                tycoonship having just passed into weak hands, and the best
                                guarantee of its power was given up when the Daimios, whom it was
                                the custom to keep in Yedo as hostages, were allowed to retire to
                                their territories. These elements of opposition have naturally been
                                concentrated round the Mikado, who can at his pleasure resume the
                                exercise of power which his ancestors and himself had simply
                                delegated.</p>
                            <p>The members of the high aristocracy could not allow this occasion to
                                pass without taking revenge for the long domination of a dynasty,
                                the founder of <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0550"/>which had
                                not even been their equal in rank; and they have put aside their
                                respective rivalries in order to combine and more effectually to
                                attack the reigning Tycoon, on the foreign question, as his weak
                                point.</p>
                            <p>Hence the resolution recently taken at Kioto to annul the treaties,
                                and which commands the Tycoon to expel the foreigners by
                                negotiations or by force.</p>
                            <p>The Tycoon comprehends his inability to fulfil such a mission; and
                                conscious of the danger to his country of such an attempt, he feels
                                inclined to temporize. But his weakness and inability take away from
                                him all influence over the councils of the Mikado.</p>
                            <p>Fortunately for us, he is not the only one who desires the adoption
                                of a more prudent policy towards the treaty powers.</p>
                            <p>A certain number of Daimios, among whom may be counted of old date
                                the Princes of Etsizen, Higo, Idzu, Yossu, and more recently
                                Satsuma, (whose views have apparently been modified by the attack on
                                Kagosima,) have given evidence, about the truth of which the
                                undersigned think there is not the slightest doubt, of their desire
                                to promote commercial relations by establishing on a new or modified
                                basis the intercourse of Japan with foreign powers.</p>
                            <p>This party has not been afraid to state its opinions in the midst of
                                the council at Kioto, but it has been obliged to give up, for the
                                present, the struggle against an overwhelming majority.</p>
                            <p>The political situations of Japan might therefore be resumed as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>Weakness of the Tycoon, and increasing powerlessness of that prince
                                to resist the violent pressure of a hostile majority;</p>
                            <p>Existence of a party favorable to continued relations with
                                foreigners, but at this moment, incapable of giving effect to its
                                opinions;</p>
                            <p>Finally, armaments of every kind prepared, with the loudly avowed
                                intention of expelling all foreigners from the country.</p>
                            <p>The position made for the representatives of foreign powers is the
                                natural consequence of the situation and the tendencies which they
                                have just pointed out.</p>
                            <p>The residence in the capital is virtually interdicted.</p>
                            <p>The passage through the inland sea is forbidden to their vessels by
                                means of batteries erected with that object.</p>
                            <p>Commanders of Japanese junks, who intended to bring merchandise to
                                the foreign residents at Nagasaki, have been killed by order of the
                                Daimio who has erected said batteries.</p>
                            <p>The people have been excited against the negotiators of the treaties
                                by speaking of imaginary calamities as attached to their
                                execution.</p>
                            <p>Orders from the local governments arbitrarily restrict the quantity
                                of produce for exportation at the three open ports. Every day brings
                                with it new obstacles to the development of the trade which
                                sometimes (Chosu has given an example) is suddenly stopped by
                                violent measures. The most elementary rules of the law of nations
                                are disregarded.</p>
                            <p>Finally, the Gorogio insists upon the abandonment of Yokohama by the
                                foreigners, and it claims that concession on the ground of its being
                                necessary for the peace of the country, and, above all, for the
                                security of the lives and property of these foreigners, whom, it
                                says, it will soon be impossible to protect against the hatred which
                                they have inspired.</p>
                            <p>And yet, what is the mission intrusted to the undersigned by their
                                respective governments?</p>
                            <p>The recent decisions of the governments to which the demands on the
                                part of the Japanese mission now in Europe have given rise, enable
                                the undersigned clearly to define their obligations.</p>
                            <p>The foreign powers not only reject, in categorical terms, the
                                propositions regarding the abandonment of Yokohama, but also refuse,
                                by anticipation, to <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0551"/>listen
                                to any overture for the modification of existing treaties for the
                                curtailment of the rights they confer.</p>
                            <p>The instructions transmitted to the undersigned are identical. All
                                are directed to maintain treaty rights intact, and to insist on
                                their complete observance. But the facts already cited, do they not
                                prove that these treaties of which the execution is required are at
                                present a mere dead letter?</p>
                            <p>The political situation and the instructions the undersigned have
                                received from their governments are in irreconcilable contradiction,
                                and they are bound, at the risk of failing in their duty, to seek
                                without delay for the proper means of effectually modifying such a
                                condition.</p>
                            <p>The representatives of foreign powers, having experienced the
                                uselessness of their representations and efforts with the government
                                of the Tycoon to obtain redress for their grievances, can only trust
                                to means at their own disposal, in order to arrive at the best
                                solution of the question that may be possible.</p>
                            <p>Looking in that direction, they recognize more than ever the
                                necessity of strengthening and consolidating their position by a
                                cordial understanding founded upon identity of interests and entire
                                unity of views as well as of action.</p>
                            <p>Suffering from the same political situation, and provided with the
                                same instructions, the question suggests itself whether it be in a
                                prolonged temporization or in energetic and prompt action that they
                                must find the remedy for the state of affairs they have pointed
                                out.</p>
                            <p>Forbearance and conciliation, and a policy characterized by these,
                                have already been pushed to the utmost limits, and failed. It is by
                                following this system that the treaty powers have been led from
                                concession to concession to the point where they have now arrived.
                                It was from prudence, and the fear of bringing about complications,
                                that they left Yedo, that they subsequently allowed themselves to be
                                almost confined in Yokohama, and that they have waited a whole year
                                for the reparation which they demanded from the local government
                                relative to the hostile expressions of the Prince of Nagato.</p>
                            <p>This long and patient forbearance was natural, so long as the treaty
                                powers could believe in the promises and assurances of the Tycoon’s
                                government; but it would now be a mistake, when undeniable facts
                                prove that it has only encouraged the retrograde aspirations of a
                                party which believes itself so certain of victory that it thinks it
                                no longer necessary to conceal its hopes and designs.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned, guided, therefore, by the experience of the past,
                                believe they ought not to hesitate in coming to the conclusion that
                                further inaction would be fatal to the interests at stake, and
                                unavoidably productive, under greater disadvantages and certainly
                                with larger proportions, of the conduct which they would by such
                                means seek to avert.</p>
                            <p>Whereas, a more energetic attitude would, on the contrary, have
                                undoubtedly for immediate result the dissipation of the idea now
                                entertained by the Daimios, that patience has only been dictated by
                                weakness or fear. A vigorous demonstration will disarrange schemes
                                scarcely yet formed, and is calculated to give support to the party
                                favorable to the maintenance of treaties before its opponents will
                                have time to crush it. It will, moreover, give a salutary lesson to
                                those semi-independent feudal chiefs who scoff at the obligations of
                                treaties, the validity of which they deny, and who, for the
                                justification of these continuous acts of violence, appeal to a
                                decree (still in existence) which makes foreigners outlaws. In a
                                word, this decided attitude may furnish to the Tycoon an occasion to
                                regain an influence which is slipping away from his weak hands,
                                although he is far from being willing to abdicate or renounce his
                                governing powers.</p>
                            <p>At all events, it may compel this prince to abandon the system of
                                duplicity and half-measures which he now follows, and openly declare
                                whether he wishes to respect the treaties, or sides with those who
                                wish to tear them up.</p>
                            <p>Thus the undersigned are unanimously agreed as to the necessity of a
                                vigorous effort; and by the final abandonment of an expectant
                                position they are convinced <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0552"
                                /></p>
                            <p>that by prolonging the passive and expectant policy they would
                                unavoidably bring about a denouement which, if there be nothing
                                formidable in it now, owing to the imposing forces that the foreign
                                powers have at their disposal in Japan, might come later, at a
                                moment when (these forces being called elsewhere) they would have to
                                resist, without adequate means, an enemy fully prepared, and who
                                would choose the hour he might judge most favorable.</p>
                            <p>How and where the first blow must be struck is easily determined by
                                an examination of the present state of things.</p>
                            <p>While the majority of the party hostile to the treaties has limited
                                itself to menace, the Prince of Choshu has resolutely taken the
                                initiative of attack by prohibiting to foreign vessels all access to
                                the inland sea, and by stopping the supplies of produce for the
                                Nagasaki market, carried on by native junks, as has been shown by
                                the successive reports received from the consular agent at that
                                port. Such continued violation of the law of nations, and formal
                                negation of treaty rights, has been encouraged by the impunity which
                                those perpetrating the acts have been allowed to enjoy. The futility
                                of the representations made by the treaty powers on this head is,
                                for the hostile Daimios, an argument upon which they build their
                                hopes for the final success of their policy, and one which they
                                freely use to keep up the excitement and courage of their followers
                                and party.</p>
                            <p>Foreign powers, therefore, in chastising the Prince of Choshu, will
                                meet the exigencies of their position, and best contribute to the
                                security and well being of their subjects, who have been injured by
                                this belligerent Daimio.</p>
                            <p>The removal of the obstructions to the free navigation in inland sea,
                                by the destruction of the batteries whence the attack has come, will
                                ruin the prestige of the aggressor, open the eyes of the hostile
                                Daimios deceived by our inaction, and show the inanity of their
                                means, and their incapability of standing before the science and
                                military resources of the treaty powers.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned, being of one and the same opinion as to the
                                necessity of acting and the direction to be given to their
                                movements, have agreed to establish certain principles to serve as
                                the bases of future co-operation, and which may also strengthen the
                                common understanding by removing suspicions which might be conceived
                                as to the future projects of each of the representatives.</p>
                            <p>They have, therefore, accepted the following articles:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 1. The undersigned lay down as the
                                basis of their policy the neutralization of Japan, and while
                                awaiting the adhesion of their respective governments thereto, they
                                engage that this principle shall prevail in the open ports.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 2. The undersigned will come to an
                                understanding as to the measures to be taken to maintain the treaty
                                rights intact, especially the liberty of commerce in the open
                                ports.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 3. Although the experience acquired at
                                the time of the expeditions to Simonoseki and Kagosima has led them
                                to consider an attack on the three open ports improbable, in
                                consequence of any operations in the inland sea, yet the undersigned
                                will, in common, take measures in order to provide for that
                                contingency, particularly as regards the port of Yokohama, which is
                                most exposed to the chances of aggression or attack.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 4. The undersigned agree not to ask
                                for nor accept any concession of territory, nor any exclusive
                                advantages whatever, either in the open ports or elsewhere in
                                Japan.</p>
                            <p>If, in order better to secure the success of operations in the inland
                                sea as elsewhere, it should appear to be useful or necessary to the
                                commanders of the military and naval forces engaged to take
                                possession of a port, island, or any portion of land, it is
                                distinctly stipulated that such possession shall confer no exclusive
                                right to the nation which shall hold it, and that the same must
                                cease as soon as the end in view shall have been attained.</p>
                            <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0553"/>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 5. The undersigned agree, moreover,
                                that they will abstain from all interference in the jurisdiction of
                                the Japanese authorities over their own people, as well as from all
                                intervention between the contending parties in the country. As the
                                basis of an “<hi rend="italic">entente cordiale</hi>” and effective
                                co-operation, in view of the common action which it may become
                                necessary in future to undertake, has been established, the
                                undersigned have agreed to bring this memorandum to the knowledge of
                                the military and naval commanders of the treaty powers, and to
                                invite them to concert among themselves the coercive means that may
                                be necessary in order to secure the proposed result. As soon as the
                                said commanders shall have declared that they are in a position to
                                act in conformity with the programme of the policy above set forth,
                                and not before, the undersigned agree to transmit to the Gorogio,
                                each separately, an identical note, which shall be substantially to
                                the following effect:</p>
                            <p>They are to be informed that their answer has been the subject of a
                                conference; regret to be expressed that the previous letter should
                                have had so little effect; mere expression of regret for injury, to
                                remain unredressed, of no avail; equally so warning of danger, if
                                foreign powers do themselves justice; persistence in demand for
                                closing of Yokohama, on a plea of necessity, overlooks a like
                                necessity in foreign powers not to consent; conference see, in the
                                general tenor of the answers, a formal and absolute negation of
                                rights, and such a situation it is impossible to accept. In
                                consequence, the foreign representatives have adopted resolutions in
                                common accord to be now communicated.</p>
                            <p>In respect to affair of Choshu, if within twenty days no material
                                change— and satisfactory guarantees for future security—action will
                                be taken through the admirals, the naval and military commanders,
                                without further communication with ministers.</p>
                            <p>In reference to the withdrawal from Yokohama, renewed protest against
                                reiteration of a demand which foreign representatives are not even
                                allowed to discuss. Suggest one consideration they seemed to have
                                overlooked in making such; persevering in this demand; concessions
                                of 1862, not absolute but conditional; non-fulfilment of conditions
                                put an end to concessions. Treaty powers revert to treaty, by this
                                right to claim execution of all articles; openning of Yedo, Osaka,
                                Hiogo, and Nagato.</p>
                            <p>This is the only answer to the demand for abandoning Yokohama.</p>
                            <p>The line of conduct here traced, and the general policy indicated
                                throughout this memorandum, as the best adapted, under all the
                                circumstances, in a political point of view, to lead to a
                                satisfactory result, obviously assumes the availability, on the
                                spot, of material forces, and their employment for the attainment of
                                the more immediate ends in view. It has accordingly been agreed by
                                the undersigned that neither the despatch and “note identique,” nor
                                any other step of a nature to commit them to any definite issue with
                                the Japanese government shall be taken, until the assurance has been
                                received of the naval and military officers in command that they are
                                prepared to give their effective cooperation whenever it may be
                                deemed necessary.</p>

                            <p>The minister resident of the United States in Japan, on his arrival
                                at this place from Yedo, learns that two steamers of her Majesty the
                                Queen of Great Britain will leave early to-morrow morning for the
                                province of Nagato, with two subjects of the Prince of Choshu. Their
                                excellencies the ministers of her Britannic Majesty and of his
                                Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the French have embraced this
                                opportunity to send forward memoranda giving their views of the
                                attitude of that prince towards the treaty powers, and the
                                inevitable destruction which awaits him if he pursue his present
                                course of hostility.</p>
                            <p>The minister of the United States fully concurs in their opinions and
                                warnings. Not having time to prepare a paper of the same character,
                                and covering the entire ground, he cordially adopts as his own the
                                language of their excellencies the ministers of Great Britain and
                                France.</p>
                            <p>The President of the United States, while desirous of preserving the
                                most peaceful and friendly relations with the government and princes
                                of Japan, has instructed his minister to use the naval force of the
                                United States for the protection of the lives and property of its
                                citizens.</p>
                            <p>The minister of the United States joins in the hope expressed by his
                                colleagues that the Prince of Choshu and all hostile Daimios will
                                heed the warnings now given. They are not made by way of threat, or
                                with any hostile feeling, but with the sincere desire that
                                hostilities may be avoided.</p>
                            <p>If hereafter, as heretofore, the lives and property of citizens and
                                subjects of the treaty powers are assailed, and the Prince of Choshu
                                shall find his power shattered, it will be because he neglects these
                                warnings given in the spirit of friendship, but with the resolute
                                purpose of resenting and punishing any aggressive acts he may
                                commit.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that while
                            in Yedo the most extraordinary peaceful revolution in the government
                            occurred that has marked its history.</p>
                        <p>I was not aware of anything unusual being in progress until I received a
                            letter from Sir Rutherford Alcock. So true is it that reliable
                            information can be more easily obtained in this place, where the
                            ministers of the treaty powers can be approached with less notice, and
                            addressed with greater security to the Japanese informer.</p>
                        <p>On questioning the governors for foreign affairs I was informed that two
                            members of the Gorogio had been dismissed from office, also the regent
                            who had refused to march troops against Daimios, declaring that they
                            were carrying out the orders of the Mikado for the expulsion of
                            foreigners, and reflected the popular sentiment. More than seventy
                            officers immediately surrounding the Tycoon, and occupying the most
                            confidential and important position, were also dismissed; these
                            officials had all been opposed to the Tycoon’s observance of the
                            treaties, and their places had been filled by those friendly to his
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>The British minister was also informed that the life of the Tycoon had
                            been attempted, and that his chief or governor of the kitchen, and four
                            of his <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0555"/>physicians, had been put
                            to death on suspicion of being implicated in such attempts. This was
                            denied by the governors, but little doubt is entertained of its
                            truth.</p>
                        <p>Takemoto Kai-no-kami, the governor of whom I have heretofore written, has
                            been again advanced, holding a confidential post near the person of the
                            Tycoon.</p>
                        <p>He still retains the office of governor for foreign affairs, and as such
                            says he will communicate immediately between the Tycoon and the
                            ministers of the treaty powers. He is now in this place, for the purpose
                            of meeting myself and colleagues. He has had an informal meeting with
                            the British minister, in which he said, that while the Tycoon was
                            sensible of the assistance he would derive from operations against
                            Choshu, he was, of course, precluded from inviting or encouraging such
                            operations. He closed a conversation characterized by great good sense,
                            with the puerile proposition that, pending such operations, Yokohama
                            should be entirely abandoned by foreigners, for fear they might be
                            attacked, and the buildings left under the guard of the Tycoon. This
                            would also prevent the issue of further orders by the Mikado for the
                            expulsion of foreigners; and when told that such course was out of the
                            question, asked that the women and children at least might be removed.
                            Now that the ships sent to Choshu have returned, we will have other
                            interviews, and it is probable a strong expeditionary force will leave
                            for his chastisement the next month, if the weather permits.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I returned to this place on the 5th
                            instant, after a visit of three weeks to the city of Yedo, having
                            succeeded in securing the settlement of the claims which I had been
                            instructed to demand of this government.</p>
                        <p>My own personal inclinations and convictions of duty, the assurance that
                            it would be unnecessary to resort to force, and the fact that the only
                            national vessel in these waters was the sailing sloop Jamestown,
                            combined to induce me to seek a peaceful solution of existing
                            differences. It was evidently the intention of the government
                            indefinitely to procrastinate the consideration of those claims they had
                            rejected and the payment of that of the Pembroke, admitted and promised
                            to be paid more than a year ago, which it now wished to make contingent
                            on its collection from the Prince of Choshu.</p>
                        <p>I availed myself of the ill-advised declarations which the Gorogio had
                            made, as far back as October, in writing, and now repeated, that they
                            could not guarantee my safety in Yedo.</p>
                        <p>The Gorogio were not content to rely on the success of such
                            representations, but were careful to make it, as they thought,
                            impossible for me to reside for any time in Yedo, by failing to proceed
                            with the rebuilding of the legation.</p>
                        <p>The only accommodation which had been provided was that of a few rooms in
                            the temple, which extended in an unbroken line, so that to reach the
                            furthest from the entrance every room had to be passed through.</p>
                        <p>I accordingly announced early in July my purpose to resume my residence
                            in Yedo, in order that I might have easier access to the government for
                            the purpose of securing the rebuilding of the legation, and of bringing
                            about a <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0556"/>settlement of our
                            claims, in which no progress had been made nor could be made at this
                            place; and that as the government were unable to provide for my safety,
                            I should aid them by asking Captain Price to anchor the Jamestown off
                            the forts at Yedo, and land a guard of marines and sailors, for the
                            defence of the legation; and that, on the arrival of another national
                            vessel, I should increase the guard if advised by them that it was
                            needful.</p>
                        <p>This led to their addressing me a letter, in which they fixed the time
                            for completing the legation building, (copy of letter, enclosure No. 1,)
                            and secured me repeated visits from governors for foreign affairs,
                            representing the insecurity of the city, and their fears of fresh
                            complications, growing out of attacks on me which might be made in Yedo,
                            and offers to meet me at once at this place.</p>
                        <p>I refused to reconsider my determination, and accordingly went to Yedo in
                            the Jamestown, Captain Price heartily entering into my views, and at my
                            request landing a guard of sixty-five marines and sailors, under the
                            command of Lieutenant Huntington, of the marine corps, and of Ensign J.
                            D. Graham.</p>
                        <p>It is needless to say I did not do this through any fears for my personal
                            safety. During my entire stay my guests and myself walked and rode
                            through Yedo without any other than a Japanese guard; and, having
                            occasion to meet my colleagues, I rode to this place alone with such
                            guard, proceeding through the worst quarter of Yedo, I was sure it would
                            greatly hasten a favorable result, and before two weeks had passed
                            everything was definitely settled.</p>
                        <p>The indemnity demanded for the legation has been paid; and
                            notwithstanding former declarations that it would be a disgrace to admit
                            it, it was declared to be a just claim, and conceded at once without
                            hesitation or delay.</p>
                        <p>The government placed in my hand a letter drawn by myself, in which they
                            said that they had directed the governor of Kanagawa, on the 5th of
                            September, to pay me the sum of $1,200, principal and interest of the
                            Pembroke claim, and in which they stated that if not paid on that day on
                            the production of my letter, it would be receivable for all public dues
                            to said amount. Borne months before I had notified them I should expect
                            interest, thinking it would hasten the payment of the principal sum. The
                            government also placed in my hands a paper prepared by myself, by which
                            they agreed that if within thirty days it should fail to arrange to my
                            satisfaction the claims for outrages on citizens at this place, it would
                            submit the same to the arbitration of his Majesty the Emperor of
                            Russia.</p>
                        <p>As it was my purpose to return to Yokohama, I obtained its assent to this
                            proposition to guard against further procrastination, I have no idea
                            they will now fail to recognize the justice of the claims. Still I
                            congratulate myself on having succeeded in procuring this first
                            recognition by this government of the principle of arbitration. I regard
                            it as no mean triumph to have induced the Tycoon to agree to submit to
                            the decision of a power so recently proscribed, and whose subjects were
                            only a few years ago maltreated, and are even now, in common with our
                            own citizens, regarded at least by Japanese law as outlaws, liable to be
                            put to death whenever they set their foot in Japan.</p>
                        <p>I am aware it would be a great condescension on the part of his Majesty
                            the Emperor of Russia to act as arbitrator in a case of so little
                            magnitude; still, I indulge the hope if, contrary to my expectation, the
                            contingency should arise requiring such action, his Majesty would, on
                            the application of the President, in view of the peculiar character of
                            this government and people, and the great advantages to be derived
                            therefrom, consent to act.</p>
                        <p>I presume the President does not desire these sums to be paid into the
                            treasury, as a law of Congress would then be required for their
                            disbursement. I therefore propose to pay the losses occasioned by the
                            legation fire, sending you the vouchers and carrying balance to credit
                            of contingent expense account. When received I will make a special
                            deposit of the Pembroke indemnity money with the owners, Russell &amp;
                            Co., until I shall have received your instructions. Expenses have been
                            incurred growing out of the presence of the Jamestown at <pb n="537"
                                xml:id="pg_537" facs="0557"/>Yedo, for which no fund is provided.
                            For example, ships-of-war are supposed to be able at all times to
                            communicate with the shore in their own boats; and yet, at low tide,
                            those of the Jamestown could scarcely approach within half a mile of the
                            landing place. Japanese boats and boatmen were therefore employed, as
                            flat-bottomed boats or scows were required, which, at times, had to be
                            drawn a long distance over the soft mud. It appears to me, therefore, it
                            would not be improper to provide for these and kindred expenses from the
                            amount paid for interest. The owners of the Pembroke will have received
                            a very large indemnity, in view of the small loss they sustained, and
                            they neither applied for nor expected interest; nor did I ask for it on
                            their behalf, but only to accelerate the payment of the principal. I
                            await instructions on this subject.</p>
                        <p>I shall not be unwilling to receive for the remaining claims less than I
                            have demanded, in view of the discretion you allowed me. The principal
                            sufferer, Mr. Robertson, is not expected to live through the year, and
                            he is now destitute of means. The American residents have lately
                            subscribed a handsome sum for his support and his passage home. I will,
                            most probably, be offered, by way of compromise, a smaller sum, and I am
                            satisfied no injustice would be done to those in whose behalf the claims
                            were made, nor any injury arise from a moderate concession.</p>
                        <p>I enclose Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, copies of such part of my
                            correspondence with the government in relation to my residence in Yedo
                            as regards its insecurity, remarking that the verbal declarations of
                            danger of the governors of foreign affairs were frequent, and designed
                            to be alarming. I also enclose No. 8, a copy of a letter addressed by me
                            to Captain Price after my return. It gives me pleasure to acknowledge
                            his valuable assistance, his readiness to comply with every request made
                            by me, and his anxiety to do all in his power to aid me in my
                            negotiations. Nor must I omit to bear witness to the uniform good
                            conduct of the guard furnished by him. I could not fail to be uneasy
                            while they were in Yedo, and was heartily rejoiced when they were once
                            more on board. Nor should I desire, unless compelled to do so, to repeat
                            the experiment. But I am happy to say that entire and uninterrupted
                            cordiality existed between them and the ordinary Japanese guard.</p>
                        <p>I have resumed my residence here to enable the government to complete the
                            legation building, as promised. It was impossible to remain in Yedo, as
                            part of the temporary buildings occupied by me had to be removed to make
                            room for the new buildings. When I left, timber had been accumulated on
                            the ground, and the buildings were actually commenced.</p>
                        <p>I also enclose No. 9, copy of the reply to Captain Price.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                            <p>In our letter of the 3d instant we stated to your excellency that
                                within one week we would inform you of the time when the rebuilding
                                of Dzenfkujee would be completed. On inquiry we learn from the
                                builders that in less than five months from this date (in our next
                                tenth month) this can be accomplished. This reckoning, however, is
                                only by approximation, and we will, therefore, give <pb n="538"

                            <p>As I left Yedo at the request of the government of his Majesty the
                                Tycoon, I think it proper to ask of your excellencies an assurance
                                that the dangers which alarmed the government have passed by, and
                                that the government are able to extend the requisite protection to
                                the legation.</p>
                            <p>I do not ask this because of any fears which I have, but because I
                                think such assurance is due to my government. As I informed the
                                President of the United States of the message you caused to be
                                delivered at the time I left Yedo, I wish to send to him your formal
                                declaration of the improved condition of that city. I propose still
                                to rely entirely on a guard to be furnished by the government of his
                                Majesty the Tycoon; and on receiving a letter from your excellencies
                                I shall be prepared, on the arrival of my furniture, to resume my
                                residence in Yedo.</p>

                            <p>We fully understood what you stated in your letter No. 108, of the
                                29th September. You certainly will not doubt that officers will be
                                sent to your legation for protection, and that we will use our best
                                efforts in this respect as far as lies in our power. Though in great
                                anxiety and constantly exerting ourselves for the prevention of
                                accidents, yet no opportunity has hitherto presented itself for the

                            <p>I have the honor to inform your excellencies that I have been
                                instructed by the President of the United States to require of your
                                excellencies that immediate provision be made for my residence at
                                Yedo.</p>
                            <p>On the 29th of September last I wrote to your excellencies, asking
                                whether the government were able to extend to the legation the
                                requisite protection, and on the first day of the ninth month
                                received a reply that it was impossible to give me the assurance I
                                desired. Since that time I have repeatedly conversed with governors
                                for foreign affairs on the subject, and by one of them was met by
                                the extraordinary remark that my colleagues were content to reside
                                at Kanagawa, and that it would not be a proof of friendship to the
                                government of the Tycoon if I insisted on residing at Yedo.</p>
                            <p>In a few days a year will have passed since the legation buildings
                                were destroyed, and no commencement has been made to rebuild them.
                                So anxious am I to meet the reasonable wishes of the President, that
                                I am willing, if no better provision be made for my accommodation,
                                to reside in the adjoining temple, although very unfit even for a
                                temporary residence.</p>
                            <p>In your letter of the eleventh day of the ninth month your
                                excellencies requested me to remain some time longer in this place,
                                and to await your further communication on the subject of my
                                residence at Yedo; and so long a time has elapsed without my
                                receiving any communication, that I feel it to be my duty again to
                                invite your excellencies’ attention to this subject.</p>
                            <p>I shall be happy to receive from your excellencies the assurance that
                                an improved state of feeling exists at Yedo, and that the government
                                is now able to assure me of its ability to protect the legation, and
                                that it will feel no anxiety for its safety should I now return to

                                all you have been instructed to state in regard to your resumption
                                of residence at Drenfkujee. The governors for foreign affairs have,
                                under our instructions, on several occasions conferred with you on
                                the subject, and stated that there are still apprehensions for
                                accidents, as we have not yet succeeded in restoring tranquillity.
                                It is, therefore, desirable that, taking these circumstances
                                together with our uneasiness into due consideration, you will in
                                suitable manner inform the President of the United States
                                accordingly.</p>
                            <p>Owing to various steps to be taken, the rebuilding of Dzenfkujee has
                                been delayed until now. We will, however, issue orders to the
                                competent officers to commence at once, and, in compliance with your
                                communication, we shall hasten the matter, in order to secure its

                            <p>I have the honor to inform your excellencies that after the 5th of
                                July I propose resuming my residence at Yedo, and to request that on
                                that day a sufficient Japanese guard be sent to the legation. In
                                order to remove as far as possible all uneasiness from the minds of
                                your excellencies, as you are of opinion that it will be unsafe for
                                me to reside there, I shall cause the United States ship Jamestown
                                to be anchored off the forts, and shall land a guard of marines of
                                one hundred to aid the Japanese guard.</p>
                            <p>I indulge the hope that my residence at Yedo will enable me to bring
                                to a more speedy and satisfactory close the questions now unhappily
                                disturbing our peaceful relations, and to draw still closer the ties
                                of friendship of the two countries. As soon as I shall arrive I will
                                thank you to send governors for foreign affairs to me to arrange for
                                an early interview with your excellencies.</p>

                            <p>Your letter dated the 29th June, No. 68, informing us of your
                                intention to return to Yedo, has been received and fully understood.
                                We caused our opinion on the subject to be communicated to you by
                                the governors for foreign affairs, Takemoto Hayato-no-kami and
                                Sibata Hioga-no-kami, but your excellency, not assenting thereto,
                                announced your firm determination to return here.</p>
                            <p>The present state of affairs in our empire, as frequently and fully
                                communicated to you, is daily getting worse, rendering it unsound
                                and deplorable. Bad people assemble, now here, then there, and then
                                again disperse; and there is much apprehension lest the relations of
                                Japan with the foreign powers be broken off. Neglecting nothing, our
                                government has in every way taken measures to tranquilize the public
                                feeling, and we are on the turning point where success may be
                                perceptible.</p>
                            <p>The plan for rebuilding Drenfkujee is already made, and the
                                rebuilding can now be gradually proceeded with, and there will be so
                                much bustle then from the coming and going of the workmen as to
                                render it very difficult to take vigilant care, which gives us
                                profound anxiety. We shall give strict orders to the competent
                                persons and arrange so as to complete it at an early day. Hence it
                                is desirable that your excellency will postpone your return until
                                the building is finished, although this return at present may be
                                urgently necessary. Within one week from to-day we agree to inform
                                you of the time required for the completion of the buildings. Should
                                your excellency, however, persist in returning at present, something
                                unforeseen might happen, all our exertions for protection
                                notwithstanding, and in such case it is certain that a return to a
                                former good feeling is impossible; the friendly ties hitherto
                                existing between our countries might be snapped asunder, which gives
                                us profound uneasiness. We therefore earnestly request you to take
                                the foregoing into due consideration.</p>
                            <p>With respect and esteem.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Japanese government having
                                arranged, to my satisfaction, the claims which I had been instructed
                                by the President of the United States to make upon it, it is my
                                pleasant duty to acknowledge the great assistance which you so
                                promptly rendered me in bringing the negotiations to a successful
                                termination. The small naval force in these waters left me little
                                choice as to the mode of procedure. Had it been much larger,
                                however, I should have adopted the course which I determined on, and
                                which has proved, as I expected, entirely successful.</p>
                            <p>Fortunately the Gorogio, by formally and in writing announcing their
                                inability to guarantee my safety in Yedo, enabled me to apply to you
                                for a guard for the legation on resuming my residence in this city,
                                which I determined to do for the purpose of bringing, pending
                                negotiations to a speedier issue.</p>
                            <p>I have now to thank you for your prompt compliance with my wishes,
                                and to announce to you that I shall not fail to inform the Secretary
                                of State of the high discipline and uniform good conduct of the
                                officers and men detailed by you as a legation guard. Though located
                                for more than three weeks in the heart of Yedo, and in constant
                                contact with the Japanese officers and soldiers, with whom they
                                pleasantly fraternized, not an unpleasant word, or even an
                                unfriendly look, marred the uniform good feeling which
                                prevailed.</p>

                                the receipt of your very civil and flattering letter of the 8th
                                instant, growing out of the connexion of this ship with your late
                                residence in Yedo. The officers and men who composed the legation
                                guard will be as much gratified as myself at the complimentary terms
                                in which you speak of their discipline and good conduct. The duty
                                devolved upon the guard was a very delicate one, to surrounds your
                                residence for the time it did in the centre of a very large city and
                                among a prejudiced and sensitive people, and that without unfriendly
                                collision of any kind; but to leave behind friendly feelings is
                                certainly more than I had anticipated. I shall have great pleasure
                                in forwarding your communication to the Navy Department.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: At a meeting of the military and naval
                            commanders held yesterday, at which were present, among others, Major
                            General Brown, commanding the British forces in China, the British and
                            French admirals, Captain Price and Captain Le Marr, the commanding
                            officer of the Dutch squadron, it was resolved to proceed at once to
                            open the straits of Simonoseki.</p>
                        <p>About 800 troops are to be left for the defence of this place; also, the
                            Jamestown and a British steam corvette, one despatch steamer, and two
                            gunboats. General Brown has also ordered from Shanghai 600 more troops,
                            including another half battery of artillery.</p>
                        <p>Not having yet received a copy of the memorandum of the naval and
                            military commanders, I am unable to send you one by this mail. It throws
                            upon the ministers of the treaty powers the responsibility of the
                            defence of this place, which we are ready to assume.</p>
                        <p>Should the large force now here withdraw without striking a blow, we feel
                            assured our position would be untenable. The best place to defend the
                            open ports is at the straits of Simonoseki. And if Choshu’s pride and
                            power are humbled, we may quite safely calculate upon an improved
                            condition of affairs. We have, besides, the knowledge that this
                            expedition will not displease the government, and that, during the
                            absence of the fleet and forces which will compose it, we may expect
                            more vigilance on the part of the Japanese guards, and an increased
                            number of them, if considered needful.</p>
                        <p>I have the pleasure to be able to say that I had an interview this day
                            with Takemoto Kai-no-kami and another confidential governor for foreign
                            affairs, and one Omestki, who have been here some days, treating for the
                            conclusion of this business, in which I expressed my concern for the
                            safety of this place during the absence of the forces, not only because
                            of the property and lives involved, but because any injury done here
                            must, of course, be regarded as done or permitted by the Tycoon,
                            situated as we were in his territories and so near his capital, and our
                            good relations with the government might therefore be thus seriously
                            impaired. I wished also to assure the government of the Tycoon that this
                            expedition was not an act of hostility to his government, but for its
                            maintenance, and in the interests of peace, which I and my colleagues
                            were satisfied could thus be more effectually secured.</p>
                        <p>The governor replied, that every precaution would be taken for the
                            defence of the place; but that it was desirable that, meanwhile, as few
                            should ride out on the Tokaido as possible, and great precautions should
                            be taken, as attacks might be made on individuals who exposed
                            themselves. He also said I had always shown a friendly disposition
                            towards the government of his Majesty the Tycoon, and that this
                            expedition was an additional proof of friendship, for which he thanked
                            me. He further said, that after the note identique, which he had been
                            informed was to be addressed to the ministers, had been received, a
                            vice-governor would come down, and request the expedition should not be
                            sent; but he desired my colleagues and myself to say that it was
                            impossible to refrain from sending it. He also said that the Daimio of
                            Boodzen, whose fortress, Kokura, was on the southern side of the
                            straits, was a great friend of the Tycoon, but being opposite to and
                            afraid of Choshu, he might be compelled to fire on the expedition. The
                            governor said he wished that Boodzen might be treated as kindly as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>I informed him that before that place was reached the batteries of Choshu
                            would all be silenced, so that no occasion would be given him to fire
                            from Kokura, and that I would ask that a flag be sent to assure him of
                            the peaceful purposes of the treaty powers towards him.</p>
                        <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0563"/>
                        <p>The interview closed with the information that he was directed by the
                            Tycoon to express his entire disapprobation of the act of firing on the
                            Monitor, and that he had no language sufficient to express his
                            indignation.</p>
                        <p>The mail has been detained, and I have only a few minutes in which
                            hurriedly to communicate this important information.</p>
                        <p>Interviews were held this day with my colleagues of Great Britain and
                            France, at which the same language was held.</p>
                        <p>You will see from the above that what I have heretofore written, that an
                            expedition could be sent to punish Choshu without involving the treaty
                            powers in a war with Japan, is quite certain to prove true.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                                26, 1864:</p>
                            <p>At a joint meeting of the ministers of the treaty powers, held
                                yesterday, it was determined, on the failure of the government
                                within twenty days to do so, to open the inland sea, now closed,
                                even to Japanese commerce with Nagasaki, by Nago. The British will
                                have fifteen ships-of-war, the Dutch four, the French three, and the
                                United States one only, the Jamestown. I would respectfully ask for
                                steamers, which, though they will not arrive in time for this
                                movement, may and probably will be necessary for the protection of
                                American interests.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that on the
                            19th ultimo, the day previous to that fixed for the departure of the
                            expedition against Choshu, and while the representatives of the treaty
                            powers were hearing the final application of the Gorogio through a
                            vice-minister, as was proposed, for its postponement, the Japanese
                            envoys, who left for Europe last spring, very unexpectedly arrived here
                            in the mail steamer. We received at the same time the intelligence of
                            the conclusion, of a convention between France and Japan, in which,
                            among other things, it was provided that the Tycoon would, within three
                            months after the return of the envoys, open the inland sea. It is
                            understood they were recalled by the Tycoon, though not expected to
                            arrive so inopportunely. It became necessary, therefore, to countermand
                            the orders for the combined expedition. Being satisfied that the envoys
                            had entered into engagements which the Tycoon could not ratify, as he
                            would thereby immediately inaugurate a civil war, and that if ratified
                            it would be impossible for him to carry them out, I addressed a <pb
                                n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0565"/>letter to the Gorogio asking to
                            be informed of his decision. The following day similar letters were
                            addressed to the ministers by my colleagues of Great Britain and the
                            Netherlands, and the minister of France at the same time inquired when
                            the Tycoon would be prepared to carry the convention into effect. We
                            were informed that governors would be despatched to give us full
                            information on the subject.</p>
                        <p>We were accordingly waited on by Takemeto Kai-no-kami and other
                            governors, the minister of France receiving them separately, and my
                            colleagues of Great Britain and the Netherlands jointly.</p>
                        <p>The governors said the return of the envoys had been very unfortunate.
                            They had first acted foolishly in making such a convention, and then in
                            returning so quickly; that the Tycoon wished they had been drowned; they
                            deserved to lose their heads, and they would be severely punished. They
                            then announced that the Tycoon had decided not to ratify the convention;
                            they also said that it was absolutely essential that the Tycoon should
                            gain time; that he would, therefore, at once send another embassy which,
                            however, would not go further than Shanghai.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the treaty powers immediately had another
                            conference, and agreed on a memorandum providing that the naval and
                            military commanders should be immediately requested to proceed as before
                            decided.</p>
                        <p>You will perceive that the memorandum contemplates taking possession of
                            some port in Choshu’s territory, with a view to securing an indemnity
                            for the expenses of the expedition, and also, if practicable, by
                            negotiation, an additional open port.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after the sailing of the expedition we were waited on by envoys
                            from the ministers with a message that Choshu had sent his chief
                            officers to Kioto with a large force, which had come in conflict with
                            the Prince of Aidzu, charged by the Tycoon with the defence of the
                            Mikado, and that during its continuance a large portion of the city had
                            been destroyed. That the Mikado had called on the Tycoon for protection,
                            and had ordered him to proceed at once to punish Choshu.</p>
                        <p>I have also been informed by a vice-minister, attended by Takemeto
                            Kai-no-kami and other governors, that the Tycoon had taken possession of
                            the Yasikis or palaces of Choshu in Yedo, and would proceed with great
                            vigor to execute the orders of the Mikado. At the same time he said he
                            had come down to ask that the fleet should not be sent against him.</p>
                        <p>The fleet had, as he was aware, already left. The expedition is composed
                            of nine British, four Dutch, three French, and one United States
                            steamer, (chartered,) the Ta-Kiang. The British admiral said he would be
                            willing to order the Jamestown to be towed to Simonoseki, if desired;
                            but, as she would be entirely useless when there, it would only mortify
                            the officers and might embarrass his movements. At the same time both
                            he, Admiral Jaures, and the captain commanding the Netherlands squadron,
                            as well as my colleagues, gave it as their opinion that it was
                            exceedingly desirable that our flag should be represented, and that,
                            though the government of Japan fully understood the position of the
                            United States, the Daimios not in the confidence of the government might
                            misapprehend it, and that, although the Jamestown would be necessarily
                            retained at this place, it was possible the impression might be created
                            thereby that the United States was not in harmony with the other treaty
                            powers. Under these circumstances Captain Price and myself felt it to be
                            our duty to charter the Ta-Kiang, an American steamer, nearly new, of
                            over 600 tons, and which it is supposed will prove quite serviceable.
                            She was placed by Captain Price under the command of Lieutenant Pearson,
                            of the Jamestown, and carries the 30-pound Parrott gun of that ship,
                            besides three small guns with which she was already armed.</p>
                        <p>I am happy to say the charter was effected on very reasonable terms. I
                            will <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0566"/>in my next enclose copy of
                            charter, and will probably be able then to give the result of the
                            expedition.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You are aware that the diplomatic
                                representatives of the treaty powers have for some time been
                                considering the condition of affairs in Japan, with a view to the

                                they have arrived, and also, with sufficient clearness, the reasons
                                which have controlled their decision to render it unnecessary for me

                            <p>I have, therefore, to request you to confer with the admirals of the

                            <p>The officers commanding the naval forces of the treaty powers at
                                Yokohama having received the memorandum of the representatives,
                                dated the 22d July, 1864, met this day on board the Euryalus, and
                                have taken into serious consideration the requisition to open the
                                straits of Simonoseki.</p>
                            <p>From the information received from the captain of the Barossa and the
                                officers sent with him, they are convinced that the straits of
                                Simonoseki continue to be closed, and that they can only be opened
                                by force.</p>
                            <p>To attain this object, the commanding officers think that it would be
                                necessary to take the greater part of the naval forces, and a
                                portion of the troops now on shore at Yokohama, and they declare
                                themselves ready to act in conformity with the programme of the
                                policy set forth in the memorandum.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, they cannot undertake to leave Yokohama until they
                                shall have been relieved entirely by their respective ministers from
                                all responsibility with regard to the defence and security of the
                                settlement.</p>

                            <p>The undersigned, representatives of the treaty powers, having met and
                                taken into consideration the copy of a minute, showing the result of
                                the deliberations of the commanding officers of the respective naval
                                forces assembled at Yokohama, and signed on the 12th instant, have
                                agreed and resolved as follows:</p>
                            <p>1. To inform the commanding officers aforesaid that they are entirely
                                relieved from all responsibility with regard to the defence and
                                security of the settlement.</p>
                            <p>2. To request them, in conformity with the programme of the policy
                                set forth in the memorandum of the undersigned, dated the 20th of
                                July last, to proceed with all convenient speed to open the straits
                                of Simonoseki, destroying and disarming the batteries of the Prince
                                of Choshu, and otherwise crippling <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548"
                                    facs="0568"/>him in all his means of attack, and to inform them
                                that the political situation renders it desirable that there should
                                be no considerable delay in the commencement of operations.</p>
                            <p>3. In the possibility of the Prince of Choshu being intimidated by
                                the imposing nature of the force brought against him, and not
                                firing, to request the naval officers, notwithstanding, to destroy
                                his batteries, and take such measures as they may deem practicable
                                to secure a material guarantee against any further hostilities from
                                the same quarter.</p>
                            <p>4. To request them to avoid entering into any negotiations with the
                                prince, reserving the solution of all ulterior questions to the
                                action of the Tycoon’s government, in connexion with the foreign
                                representatives,</p>
                            <p>5. To suggest that any demonstration of force in the vicinity of
                                Osacca be avoided as possibly giving rise to some new complications,
                                and in order not to change the character of this expedition, which
                                ought to be regarded no otherwise than as a chastisement to be
                                inflicted on an outlaw or a pirate.</p>
                            <p>To request the commanding officer to secure the return to Yokohama of
                                such part of the squadron as may not be required for a free passage,
                                as soon as the operations here contemplated shall have been
                                completed.</p>
                            <p>Signed this 15th day of August.</p>

                                the sudden return of the Japanese mission from Europe and the
                                conclusion of a convention at Paris, before their departure, with

                                straits of Simonoseki in three months after the date of the arrival
                                of the said envoys in Japan, have agreed and resolved—</p>
                            <p>1. To suspend the operations contemplated in their memorandum of the

                                the said convention (so far as regards the straits) signed by his
                                envoys in Paris or not.</p>

                                request them, in accordance herewith, to suspend all operations

                                several answers received from the ministers of the Tycoon relative
                                to the convention signed in Paris on the 20th of June last by his
                                excellency the minister of foreign affairs and the Japanese
                                envoys—</p>
                            <p>The representatives of Great Britain, the United States of America,
                                and the Netherlands state that, in answer to the demand addressed by
                                them, respectively, on the 21st and 22d instant, to the minister of
                                foreign affairs at Yedo, their excellencies have declared officially
                                that it was impossible for the Tycoon’s government to give execution
                                to the article of the convention relating to the opening of the
                                straits of Simoneseki.</p>
                            <p>His excellency the minister plenipotentiary of France states, for the
                                information of his colleagues, that notwithstanding his efforts to
                                obtain from the Gorogio the ratification of the convention of Paris,
                                the ministers of the Tycoon, while testifying their respect for the
                                government of his Imperial Majesty the Emperor, have declared the
                                Tycoon to be quite unable, and therefore categorically refused to
                                ratify the article of the convention relative to his co-operation
                                with France for the opening of the straits of Simonoseki.</p>
                            <p>Under these circumstances, putting aside any question relative to the
                                consequences which the refusal of the Tycoon to ratify the
                                convention may have— questions in the competence of France alone to
                                discuss—and considering that the said convention, which had
                                suspended the combined operations contemplated <pb n="550"
                                    xml:id="pg_550" facs="0570"/>in their memorandum signed on the
                                22d July, and the note of the 15th August last, has not been
                                ratified, and that it is consequently without effect.</p>
                            <p>Considering further that the government of the Tycoon declares his
                                inability, by his own efforts, to open the straits of Simonoseki,
                                the undersigned agree unanimously—</p>
                            <p>1. To make known to the commanding officers of the respective naval
                                forces at Yokohama the actual state of affairs, and to request they
                                will consider as no longer in force the official communication made
                                to them on the 20th instant, on the part of the undersigned, calling
                                upon them to suspend operations, but that they will, on the
                                contrary, make the necessary arrangements to give effect with as
                                little delay as possible to the programme of measures specified in
                                the memorandum of the 22d July last.</p>
                            <p>2. To request the said naval officers in command further to take into
                                consideration the means of seizing some important position in or
                                commanding the straits of Simonoseki, or otherwise in the vicinity,
                                as they may judge most expedient or practicable, and of holding such
                                position as a guarantee until the undersigned representatives may
                                obtain, in connexion with the government of the Tycoon, an indemnity
                                from the Prince of Nagato to cover the expenses occasioned to their
                                respective governments by the expedition now to be despatched
                                against his batteries, and until possession can be given to the
                                Tycoon, or authorities deputed by him, of the whole line of
                                territory coasting the straits now appertaining to the said Prince
                                of Nagato.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned, moreover, deem it their duty to call the attention
                                of the respective senior naval officers to the possibility, as a
                                result of their operations, of obtaining an open port for trade in
                                or near the straits of Simoneseki, and to invite them, with this
                                object in view, to furnish the undersigned with such information as
                                to the relative advantages, in a maritime point of view, of the town
                                of Simoneseki, and other adjoining places, as their opportunities of
                                studying on the spot the capabilities of different ports may enable
                                them to supply.</p>
                            <p>It is distinctly understood that the indemnities of which there is
                                question herein are solely those resulting from the action in common
                                of the powers represented by the undersigned, and that those do not
                                in any way affect or prejudice the right of each power, ulteriorly,
                                to prosecute any claims it may see fit to make for separate
                                grievances not arising out of such common action. The necessity of
                                clearly defining and keeping distinct the present action in common
                                of the four powers with combined forces, and any separate action
                                which may subsequently be entered upon by one of their number, is
                                distinctly recognized by the undersigned.</p>

                            <p>The letter your excellencies wrote on the 30th of June last, in
                                answer to mine of the 30th of the preceding month, has been received
                                and fully understood.</p>
                            <p>A letter of the same date and tenor having been received by each of
                                my colleagues also, the representatives of the four powers met in
                                conference to deliberate on the purport of your answer, and the
                                coarse to be adopted in consequence.</p>
                            <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0571"/>
                            <p>The resolutions come to, after long and serious consideration due to
                                the gravity of the situation, were communicated to the vice-minister
                                and governor for foreign affairs, appearing on the part of the
                                Gorogio, at our request, on the 19th instant.</p>
                            <p>Having fully weighed all that was urged by the aforesaid delegates,
                                it is now my duty to make known the result.</p>
                            <p>In the opinion of all the representatives, the answer of your
                                excellencies of the 30th of June is virtually a negation of
                                important treaty rights. Your vice-minister, while urging the
                                postponement of the expedition, could not but admit that it was the
                                duty of the Tycoon to chastise the Prince of Choshu; at the same
                                time he confessed that no specific period could be fixed within
                                which action would be taken. Nor could your delegates deny that
                                there was justification in these circumstances for the course which
                                the representatives had finally resolved upon.</p>
                            <p>The reason urged on the part of the Tycoon for past delay, while
                                insufficient to justify the inaction complained of, failed
                                altogether in satisfying us that within any specific time, however
                                remote, effective steps would be taken by the Tycoon. It was
                                evident, therefore, to all that this Daimio would go entirely
                                unpunished unless the treaty powers themselves should take the
                                matter in hand.</p>
                            <p>The foreign representatives have accordingly, by common consent,
                                called upon the senior naval and military officers, without further
                                delay, to take the necessary steps to remove the obstructions now
                                existing to the free passage of the straits, and to prevent any
                                similar interruption to foreign trade in that locality.</p>
                            <p>As regards the retirement of foreigners from Yokohama, and the
                                warning of danger if they remain, your excellencies and the Gorogio
                                now know that our respective governments peremptorily refused to
                                entertain any proposition for the closing of the port. As to dangers
                                menacing the settlement or the lives of foreigners, it only remains,
                                therefore, for myself and my colleagues to warn the government of
                                the Tycoon of the consequences of any attempt upon life or property
                                pending the contemplated operations, when a large portion of the
                                allied forces must necessarily be absent. This may be thought by
                                lawless and ill-disposed parties a favorable opportunity for
                                disturbing our tranquillity, if not for attack. But it is my duty to
                                warn your excellencies in time that any violence or measures of
                                intimidation or coercion tending to alarm or drive away the native
                                population about us, or otherwise molest the residents and affect
                                their security or trade, will be considered an act of hostility for
                                which the whole nation shall be held responsible. And whoever the
                                assailants may be, should any of these evils be experienced, steps
                                will be taken to make the responsibility felt by reprisals, not only
                                directed against Yedo, but Osacca and Kioto.</p>
                            <p>We hope, therefore, in the interest of the Mikado and Tycoon, no less
                                than of the whole country, peace will not be disturbed here or at
                                any of the ports open to foreign trade.</p>
                            <p>With respect and esteem,</p>

                                river,) bands of people of a suspicious appearance were seen
                                advancing, collecting together into a large mob. They attacked the
                                west end of Kioto and committed violence, and advancing towards the
                                palace of the Mikado, supposed with the intention of seizing or
                                capturing the person of the Mikado. The guards got ready and made
                                preparations for the defence of the gates. Now a band of soldiers,
                                supposed to belong to Choshu, opened fire with small and large guns,
                                advancing at the same time to the number of 500 or more. A large
                                fire was raging at the same time, and destroyed the houses from the
                                west end of the town, advancing rapidly towards the Mikado’s palace.
                                The troops guarding Kioto, belonging to Matsdaira Higo-no-kami
                                (Aisoo <note n="*" xml:id="d499fn1">Aisoo is also called the

                                attacked by the soldiers of Choshu, and a serious engagement took
                                place on that spot, as great numbers of wounded and killed on both
                                sides show. I have not arrived at the particulars of the fight, but
                                shall send them afterwards. The Mikado is well protected, but as the
                                fire is still raging, the panic is great among the merchants and
                                citizens.</p>

                            <p>Before daybreak, on the 20th instant, the troops of Choshu assembled
                                on the hill, Tennosow, (near Kioto,) in the temple of Tenlonsi, and
                                advanced suddenly towards the town of Kioto. A fight began with the
                                guards of the Mikado’s palace. On both sides big guns were
                                continually firing. At 3 o’clock in the morning a column of smoke
                                and fire was seen rising from the Choshu’s yankis (residences of
                                Choshu) in the Kawaramasoo and in Fuscimi, apparently set fire to
                                inside. The fight near the Mikado’s palace was in the mean time
                                increasing. At mid-day the wounded and killed were lying about in
                                heaps. The houses of the Mikado’s officers, named Iakatsukasa and
                                Kusio, were burned. The streets were also set on fire on the west
                                side Termatshi, on the east side Karasoomaroo, all burning at the
                                same time. In the night of the 20th nearly the whole town was laid
                                in ashes. On the 21st the temples of Kiomilu and Kodaisi and Awada
                                Sisigtani were fired upon with large guns and set on fire, which
                                burned up to the castle called Nigio. The Mikado has been obliged to
                                fly to the temple of Hiyesan, five ri from Kioto. The battle is
                                still raging, whilst the empty plains of Kioto are filled with
                                soldiers dressed in armor. The citizens have all left the ruins.</p>

                            the straits of Simonoseki, bringing the intelligence that on the 4th,
                            6th, 7th, and 8th day of September last, the batteries of Choshu,
                            commanding these straits, were entirely destroyed, the magazines blown
                            up, shot and shell thrown into the sea, and the guns, to the number of
                            nearly seventy, carried away. The prince made an unconditional
                            surrender, and agreed to pay such sum as the ministers of the treaty
                            powers might demand for the expenses of the expedition.</p>
                        <p>Ensign Pearson, of the Jamestown, who was placed in command of the United
                            States chartered steamer Takiang, I am happy to say, conducted himself
                            so as to receive the special written thanks of Admiral Kuper, commanding
                            the combined fleet, and a large bronze 32-pounder gun was assigned to
                            said ship as a trophy. The 30-pounder gun of the Jamestown was used by
                            him with such precision and efficiency as to command universal
                            admiration. The wounded of the British were placed on board that ship,
                            in charge, in part, of Dr. Vedder, of the Jamestown.</p>

                            unavoidable it had become.</p>
                        <p>As soon as Admiral Kuper returns with the balance of the fleet, the
                            ministers will have an interview with the government to consider
                            propositions already engaging their attention, among which are:</p>
                        <p>1. The open declaration by the Tycoon of his disapproval of the course of
                            the reactionary party.</p>
                        <p>2. The ratification by the Mikado of the treaties.</p>
                        <p>3. The payment by the Tycoon of the expenses of the expedition, in behalf
                            of Choshu, on the opening of a port at Simonoseki.</p>
                        <p>4. The imperiapzation of so much of the territories of Choshu as command
                            these straits.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I had the honor, in my despatch No. 61, of
                            the 1st instant, to inform you of the return of the fleet and the
                            results of its operations at the straits.</p>
                        <p>The government immediately despatched officers to confer with the
                            ministers. The gratification of the government was quite apparent,
                            though shaded by a slight tinge of mortification that so little valor
                            and capability of resistance had been displayed. On the return of the
                            fleet, it was determined at once to ask for an interview with the
                            Gorogio, to confer on subjects which we had indicated through its
                            agents, in order that they might not be unprepared for instant
                            decision.</p>
                        <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0574"/>
                        <p>The Jamestown being in quarantine, in consequence of the prevalence of
                            several cases of small-pox, the British minister and admiral kindly
                            placed at my disposal her British Majesty’s steamer Argus, in which I
                            proceeded to Yedo, and remained during my stay there, as the legation
                            was not in a condition for occupation, being still unfinished. I have
                            not failed to acknowledge this courtesy.</p>
                        <p>The first conference was formal and inconclusive, in consequence of the
                            large number of governors and other high officials in attendance, in
                            whose presence the Gorogio did not wish to discuss the delicate
                            questions proposed. It was, therefore, arranged that the British
                            minister and myself should have a confidential meeting with the Gorogio
                            the ensuing day at twelve o’clock, and that the French and Netherland
                            ministers should join us at two o’clock, bringing with them the officers
                            of the fleet for presentation.</p>
                        <p>This interview was closed with the presentation of letters to the Tycoon,
                            which myself and my colleagues of Great Britain and France had prepared
                            in consequence of the disturbed aspect of affairs, and which the Gorogio
                            said they would immediately bring to the notice of the Tycoon.</p>
                        <p>The memoranda of these conferences and of the preparatory meetings with
                            the agents of the Gorogio are so full as to render it unnecessary for me
                            to enter into any detailed statement.</p>
                        <p>On the second day we were received by three ministers, two
                            vice-ministers, and several governors for foreign affairs, with very
                            great cordiality. Indeed, I have never seen the Gorogio so animated and
                            friendly, nor been present at any interview where so much interest was
                            shown, and at which all the ministers participated in the discussion.
                            The result was, that a promise was given that all the restrictions,
                            which they admitted they had imposed on trade, should be removed; that
                            the Tycoon’s government would assume and pay all indemnities for
                            outrages committed by Choshu, and the expenses of the expedition against
                            him, if our governments preferred to receive the same, rather than to
                            have another port opened in the vicinity of the straits. We were careful
                            to say that our governments did not desire to impose pecuniary fines; it
                            was not money, but their friendship and trade, that we wanted. The
                            Gorogio replied that they would prefer to assume the payment of the
                            indemnities; that it was impossible for them to agree to open another
                            port at the time one of their number was on his way to the Mikado to
                            induce him to withdraw his order to close those already opened.</p>
                        <p>We then urged the necessity of procuring the Mikado’s ratification of the
                            treaties, and we were assured every effort would be made by the Tycoon,
                            and without delay, to procure such ratification.</p>
                        <p>You will remember that as early as the 27th June, 1863, (despatch No.
                            45,) I had the honor to invite your attention to the necessity of this,
                            and to declare my conviction that peace and quiet could not prevail
                            until the Mikado was thus in accord with the Tycoon; and it is
                            exceedingly gratifying to me that my colleagues have so fully and
                            heartily concurred in those views. You will perceive, in my letter to
                            the Tycoon, I was careful to say that this was desired for the sake of
                            the internal peace and quiet of Japan, and not to acquire any rights.
                            Our treaties with the Tycoon were sufficient for every purpose, except
                            that of preventing intrigues and opposition to his government by
                            combinations of Daimios.</p>
                        <p>The Gorogio gave each of the ministers a letter, agreeing to pay
                            indemnities, and promised, within eight days, to send commissioners with
                            full powers to agree upon the sums to be paid to each power, and to
                            arrange all undecided questions as to further facilities of trade at the
                            open ports.</p>
                        <p>It is not possible to believe that the government of the Tycoon would
                            have dared to agree to any such proposition, had it not felt that their
                            power was <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0575"/>strengthened by the
                            prostration of the prince who stood forward as the representative of
                            Japanese isolation and intolerance.</p>
                        <p>The ministers of the treaty powers, when they decided on the expedition
                            to the straits of Simonoseki, with instructions to commence hostilities
                            against Choshu, the prince of the provinces of Suwo and Nagato, without
                            further notice or negotiation, assumed a grave responsibility which they
                            would gladly have transferred to their respective governments had delay
                            been compatible with a proper regard to the interest or even the safety
                            of the citizens and subjects of these governments in Japan. From their
                            own observation, and the conclusion arrived at after interview with the
                            high officers of government, they could not fail to be impressed with a
                            feeling of insecurity created by the increasing strength of the hostile
                            party, which was, moreover, acquiring solidity, and even governmental
                            sanction, through the influence it had over the Mikado, who sympathized
                            with and adopted their views.</p>
                        <p>Though the treaties are to some extent the cause of trouble in Japan,
                            they are, to a much greater extent, the pretext eagerly embraced by
                            intriguing and ambitious Daimios, some of whom are known to aspire to
                            the Tycoonship, each hoping that, with the fall of the Tycoon, and the
                            favor of the Mikado secured, that high position would not be beyond his
                            reach. The fear that the Tycoon would not be able to retain his power
                            was by no means unreasonable, and could not be overlooked in
                            ascertaining our true position and danger. He was confessedly too weak
                            faithfully to observe the treaties. Trade was paralyzed and threatened
                            with entire destruction because he declared it necessary to temporize;
                            and while assuring us of his good faith, promised the hostile and now
                            dominant party that he only waited for the opportune moment to terminate
                            those treaties; meanwhile, throwing every obstacle in the way of trade,
                            the safety of the foreign powers was involved in the stability of the
                            Tycoon’s government, with which our relations exist, from which we
                            derived whatever rights we possessed, and which, if prostrated, would
                            leave us without a friend, and liable to be involved in the struggle
                            which would ensue. The best place to defend the open ports was,
                            therefore, manifestly at the straits of Simonoseki, where the strength
                            of the hostile party might be broken before it was ready to be
                            precipitated on these ports.</p>
                        <p>While the conferences with the government were in progress, and the
                            expedition had been decided upon, the Prince of Nagato, (fortunately for
                            the government of the Tycoon,) taking the alarm, made a rash but
                            ineffectual attempt to secure the person of the Mikado. A large portion
                            of the capital city of Kioto was destroyed by fire, but the assailants
                            were utterly routed by the Daimios, charged by the Tycoon with its
                            defence. The Mikado, filled with apprehension for his safety, appealed
                            to the Tycoon, and Choshu was declared an outlaw by both these
                            sovereigns.</p>
                        <p>The allies, therefore, not only sustained the Tycoon’s government in the
                            most effectual but in the only possible way, and, at the same time, had
                            the good fortune to act in the interests of the Mikado.</p>
                        <p>It may be asked, why, then, was not the expedition undertaken in concert
                            with the forces of the Tycoon?</p>
                        <p>While the Tycoon could not give any valuable or needful aid, other than
                            that which might be derived from his avowed sanction, he would have
                            excited the jealousy and aroused the pride of the Daimios by an open
                            co-operation with foreigners. It would have been a violation of the
                            procedure required by usage and ancient law against a Daimio who had
                            subjected himself to punishment.</p>
                        <p>The treaty powers dared not wait this slow process, already prolonged a
                            year because of the differences between the Mikado and Tycoon; and the
                            government of the Tycoon was forced, while yielding a secret assent to
                            the measure through its confidential agents, formally to ask its
                            postponement, and to offer <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0576"/>to
                            summon the refractory prince to Yedo; and, in default of his appearance,
                            to array against him the power of the empire. Under these circumstances
                            the expedition sailed.</p>
                        <p>That the representatives judged wisely is demonstrated by the papers
                            herewith enclosed, which will show that the government, far from
                            considering the expedition as an act of war, regard it as having
                            relieved them from the pressure of alarm and danger, and as having
                            imparted a degree of confidence and strength which will enable it to act
                            with vigor not only, but for the first time with singleness of purpose
                            and without duplicity.</p>
                        <p>The President will perceive, from these brief remarks, that I regard my
                            course and that of my colleagues as entirely consistent with the views
                            (enclosure No. 2, of my despatch No. 38) which I made known to the
                            British minister, and which he did me the honor to communicate to his
                            government.</p>
                        <p>I have been kindly permitted to read Earl Russell’s very flattering reply
                            to Sir Rutherford Alcock’s despatch enclosing a copy of my letter, and
                            have been favored with the following extract:</p>
                        <p>“There is another course of policy which appears preferable either to
                            precipitating hostilities, or to the abandonment of the rights we have
                            acquired by our treaties. This course of policy appears to be in
                            conformity with the views so moderately and carefully expressed by the
                            minister of the United States.</p>
                        <p>“This policy consists in—</p>
                        <p>“1st. Giving every encouragement and support to such of the Tycoon’s
                            ministers, and to such of the Daimios as are favorable to foreign trade,
                            and thus lead to the ultimate weakening of the feudal system and of the
                            protectionist theory of Japan.</p>
                        <p>“2d. To make arrangements with the Japanese government for the protection
                            of the foreign settlement at Yokohama.</p>
                        <p>“3d. To keep for the present a strong squadron in the Japanese sea.</p>
                        <p>“4th. To endeavor to establish an understanding with the government of
                            France, the Netherlands, and the United States, with a view to our
                            common interests in Japan.”</p>
                        <p>Earl Russell, in a subsequent despatch, shown me in confidence by the
                            British minister, fortunately received after the sailing of the
                            expedition, directed Sir Rutherford Alcock to refrain from using the
                            forces of her Majesty against either the government of the Tycoon or any
                            Daimio. I learn from the consul-general of the Netherlands that his
                            government was consulted by the British government as to the propriety
                            of adopting a more pacific policy in Japan, and I presume the government
                            of the United States and that of Great Britain have had the same
                            question under consideration.</p>
                        <p>It is my belief that the result of the expedition to the straits of
                            Simonoseki has greatly contributed to, if it has not secured altogether,
                            our safety in Japan. It has broken and scattered the opposition to the
                            Tycoon, relieved him of the apprehension of dethronement, and enabled
                            him to compel, once more, the residence of the Daimios and their
                            families at Yedo. The abolition of this ancient usage was wrung from his
                            weakness. While its restoration must be regarded as a retrograde
                            movement, it is, probably, necessary at present to the preservation of
                            the crumbling power of the Tycoon. At the same time an order, in the
                            nature of an excommunication, has been issued by the Mikado, depriving
                            the Prince of Choshu of the names and titles conferred on him by his
                            ancestors and those of the Tycoon, virtually absolving his subjects from
                            their allegiance, and making him landless and nameless. This edict is to
                            be enforced by twenty-one Daimios, summoned to the standard of the
                            Tycoon. Whether Choshu will be able to defy this decree, and resist,
                            successfully, the force which may be sent against him, will depend upon
                            his own ability and the loyalty and valor of his retainers, as well as
                            upon the fact whether his peers wish his downfall. The Gorogio informed
                            us that the Tycoon would deprive him of his territories and assign
                            portions <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0577"/>to different Daimios,
                            reserving the district commanding the entrance to the Inland sea as
                            imperial territory. It was for this reason the government so willingly
                            assumed the payment of the indemnities. It is probable the struggle will
                            be protracted, as Choshu will have the advantage of a defensive
                            position, and Japanese warfare is necessarily dilatory. But it is
                            manifest that the operations of the allies have deprived him of his
                            chief means of defence, and that the government takes advantage of this
                            to assume the attitude of open hostilities. The palaces of Choshu at
                            Yedo have been levelled to the ground. The land, being a gift from the
                            Tycoon, can be resumed, but the buildings, according to usage, must be
                            removed. We passed the site of his chief yaski, or palace, <hi
                                rend="italic">en route</hi> to our interview with the Gorogio; but
                            it was not till long after the expedition had sailed, and until the news
                            of its success could have reached the Tycoon overland, that his summary
                            measure was adopted.</p>
                        <p>I, therefore, am perfectly satisfied my course will meet the approval of
                            the President. While I am not able positively to say, and with entire
                            confidence, that peaceful relations are fully assured, I am able to
                            state that our position in Japan would not have been tenable if a more
                            pacific policy had prevailed, and that what has been done will prove our
                            best guarantee against matured hostilities, which would involve a
                            greater expenditure of blood and treasure, and possibly a war with the
                            entire country.</p>
                        <p>I thank the President most heartily for the confidence he has bestowed on
                            me, and for leaving me unfettered by any instructions other than the
                            expression of his wish that peaceful relations might continue; and the
                            more so, that it enables me to say, without the appearance of preferring
                            a complaint, that it is my deliberate conviction that no other course
                            can be adopted with safety or honor, and that the minister accredited to
                            this government should be clothed with full powers and free from
                            specific instructions, which, though wise when given, may become, even
                            while in transitu, entirely inapplicable, in consequence of the changed
                            aspect of affairs, and that the incumbent, if undeserving of this
                            confidence, should be superseded as soon as possible by a minister who,
                            by his prudence, wisdom, and experience, shall be entitled to receive
                            the entire confidence of the President.</p>
                        <p>The three ships-of-war which had been temporarily left by the admiral at
                            the straits returned to this port on the 10th instant, bringing envoys
                            to the foreign ministers from the Prince of Choshu.</p>
                        <p>I must confess this prince has my sympathy; an open foe is much to be
                            preferred to a deceitful and doubtful friend. He has acted with
                            consistency, vigor, and boldness. He now desires peace, and his past
                            history will probably prove a guarantee for his future sincerity. If, as
                            I think is highly probable, he shall escape the destruction now
                            threatened, perhaps, on payment of a large fine, little damage need be
                            apprehended from his open hostility, and probably as little from his
                            secret opposition.</p>
                        <p>The mission sent by him is a very significant proof of the thoroughness
                            with which the work of repression was carried out, and will, without
                            doubt, have a salutary influence on all the Daimios, as well as the
                            government itself.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to enclose—</p>

                            <p>The instructions of the Emperor of Japan and those of the Tycoon are
                                different. Because, in obedience to the Emperor’s commands, I, at
                                Simonoseki, fired upon foreign vessels, I have received the name of
                                rebel.</p>
                            <p>When I appeared to be acting in opposition to the imperial orders, a
                                messenger came from the foreign nations to make it known to me and
                                demand its discontinuance. This being the case, Nagato-no-kami (son
                                and heir) went on horseback to Kioto to learn the Emperor’s will.
                                Before arriving there, an insurrection having arisen in Kioto, there
                                was no alternative but to return without having accomplished the
                                mission. Three days ago I heard your illustrious country’s ships had
                                come to Ituna Sima. I sent a messenger, Mr. Ama, to you by boat, to
                                say that I did not care whether you passed through the straits or
                                not. Whilst on his way you left the island and the boat returned,
                                thinking to reach you from Simonoseki. Much time having elapsed, in
                                the interval war broke out.</p>
                            <p>For this inability to prevent its breaking out I am exceedingly
                                sorry. I have not, from the first, hated foreigners. I consider this
                                war a great affliction to thousands of people. I desire nothing but
                                amity. Please consider the subject well. Further particulars Mowou
                                Idsumo, my minister and his associates, will make known to you.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sire</hi>: The President of the United States is
                                unable, by reason of the great distance which separates our country
                                from Japan, to address to your Majesty considerations, and to offer
                                advice such as, in great emergencies, those invested with supreme
                                power frequently offer to the presidents and sovereigns with which
                                they are in alliance.</p>
                            <p>Believing that I shall thereby most acceptably discharge my duty, I
                                have, in concert with my colleagues, come to the grave resolution to
                                address to your Majesty direct such observations in reference to the
                                present attitude of Japan as may serve to show the imminence of the
                                danger which, in our judgment, threatens it, and the only course
                                which can be taken to avert it. I am confident your Majesty will not
                                only excuse the liberty, but will give those observations that
                                candid and mature consideration which is due to them, as coming from
                                the representative of a nation animated by sincere friendship for
                                your Majesty personally, and a disinterested desire for the
                                prosperity of your empire.</p>
                            <p>The governments with which your Majesty has made treaties regard
                                those treaties as clothed with every sanction necessary to their
                                validity and force. Nor can your Majesty, without a sacrifice of
                                honor and sovereignty, allow any of your subjects to deny your
                                perfect right to make such treaties. Your Majesty will, therefore,
                                understand what I say as neither intimating nor admitting that any
                                public act is necessary to confer rights on the treaty powers not
                                already acquired.</p>
                            <p>Their representatives cannot, however, shut their eyes to the fact
                                that several turbulent and hostile Daimios, in order to promote
                                their own selfish purposes, have endeavored to bring into collision
                                the authority of your Majesty and the Mikado—to interrupt your
                                cordial relations, and to render antagonistic powers which, for more
                                than two centuries, have been exercised in entire harmony.</p>
                            <p>They have, unfortunately, been successful in making the Mikado
                                believe that the treaties were injurious to Japan, and that they
                                could be annulled. This he has called on your Majesty to do, leaving
                                no option between opposition to his wishes and a violation of the
                                treaties, which would eventuate in war.</p>
                            <p>Not, therefore, for the purpose of acquiring any rights or privileges
                                for themselves, but for the preservation of the ancient polity and
                                laws of Japan, and the continuance of the exercise of powers by your
                                Majesty and the Mikado, which have been so long in harmonious
                                action, the treaty powers, through their representatives, would urge
                                the immediate necessity of inducing the Mikado to give those
                                treaties his high sanction, and thus removing every cause of
                                opposition and existing inducements for hostile combinations.</p>
                            <p>Your Majesty has endeavored to reconcile the obligations thus imposed
                                by the Mikado with those assumed with the treaty powers. Their
                                representatives, appreciating the difficulties of your position,
                                have been disposed to exercise great moderation and forbearance. But
                                your Majesty must now be satisfied that the time has arrived when it
                                is necessary for you to declare that the treaties must and shall be
                                faithfully observed, and to abandon all half-way measures.</p>
                            <p>I should not discharge my duty if I failed to declare that the treaty
                                powers cannot abandon the rights acquired under these treaties, and
                                that continued violations of them by the subjects of your Majesty
                                may subject the whole empire to measures of repression and reprisal,
                                which have hitherto, fortunately, been confined to comparatively
                                small districts.</p>
                            <p>Peace, both at home and abroad, can be best secured by a fair and
                                open policy, which shall avoid holding out expectations to the
                                hostile party which can never be realized, and encouraging
                                combinations which will be made stronger by concession.</p>
                            <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0580"/>
                            <p>The United States earnestly hope that your Majesty will be guided by
                                such wise counsels as shall enable you to preserve friendly
                                relations with the treaty powers by observing the treaties with
                                perfect fidelity, and by disarming all opposition to your rightful
                                authority.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, with great respect, your Majesty’s most

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sire</hi>: At the present moment, when a grave
                                resolution is about to be taken, of a nature to influence the
                                relations of your country with foreign powers, I conceive it my
                                duty, as the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary
                                accredited by my sovereign to your Majesty, to submit for your
                                appreciation the following observations bearing upon the actual
                                situation, in order to define with precision the real questions at
                                issue, which it is becoming each day more urgently necessary to
                                solve in a satisfactory manner.</p>
                            <p>The experience of the last few years has abundantly manifested that
                                there exists a want of accord on the subject of foreign relations
                                between the Mikado and Tycoon. Public proclamations and official
                                declarations of the members of the Gorogio to the foreign
                                representatives have otherwise placed the fact beyond all doubt.</p>
                            <p>The Mikado requiring the abrogation of treaties, has reduced the
                                Tycoon to the alternative of either disobeying his legitimate
                                sovereign, or bringing on his country all the calamities of a war
                                against four of the greatest powers in the west; for to annul
                                treaties, entered into with them without their consent, is to
                                declare war.</p>
                            <p>The Tycoon, desiring to avoid both of these fatal contingencies, has
                                hitherto sought a solution of the difficulty by half measures,
                                equally distasteful to the Mikado and to foreign powers.</p>
                            <p>Hence the formal demand for the abandonment of Yokohama, and the
                                hostile act of Daimios forming a Sako party. The treaty powers have
                                replied by the despatch of military and naval forces adequate to the
                                protection of this port and the destruction of the batteries and
                                defences of the Prince of Nagato.</p>
                            <p>The Mikado can no longer be under any illusion, therefore. If he
                                continue to secure the abrogation of treaties, he must also desire
                                war.</p>
                            <p>It is for the Tycoon, who knows all the danger of the situation, to
                                anticipate and prevent the fatal consequences. The time for half
                                measures has passed irrevocably. The four great powers, having
                                material interests in Japan, can no longer suffer their own dignity
                                and the interests of their subjects to be called in question.</p>
                            <p>A solution of the difficulty has become indispensable, and the only
                                one that promises either peace or security is the ratification of
                                the treaties by the Mikado.</p>
                            <p>This act, which offers <hi rend="italic">the only guarantee which the
                                    treaty powers can accept</hi>, will put an end to a situation
                                becoming each hour more pregnant with danger. This basis once laid,
                                it would be easy to come to a mutual understanding as to the
                                reconstruction of the rest of the edifice and the maintenance of
                                good relations.</p>
                            <p>It is with the view of indicating this solution, sire, and, above
                                all, to lead you to comprehend that it ought to be <hi rend="italic"
                                    >immediate</hi>, that I have determined, after <pb n="561"

                                to address this letter personally to your Majesty, persuaded that
                                the frankness and loyalty of its language, if listened to, will
                                prevent calamities which must result from a continuation of the
                                policy hitherto followed in regard to foreigners by the government
                                of your Majesty.</p>

                                <p>Present: Sir Rutherford Alcock, K. C. B., her Majesty’s envoy
                                    extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary; Monsieur Leon
                                    Rocher, minister plenipotentiary of his Imperial Majesty the
                                    Emperor of the French; Robert H. Pruyn, esq., minister resident
                                    of the United States; Monsieur de Graeff Van Polsbrock, his
                                    Netherland Majesty’s consul general and political agent;
                                    Takemoto Kai-no-kami, principal governor of foreign affairs and
                                    confidential agent of the Tycoon; Shibata Hinga-no-kami,
                                    governor of foreign affairs; Kolimoto Kai-no-kami, Ometske of
                                    the first class.</p>
                                <p>The British envoy informed the Japanese officials that her
                                    Majesty’s ship Perseus arrived, as he had anticipated, only a
                                    few hours after Takemoto had taken his leave yesterday. By this
                                    vessel despatches had been received from the senior naval
                                    officers by his colleagues and himself, acquainting them that in
                                    two days the whole of the batteries of the Prince Nagato had
                                    been silenced, and the force collected for their defence
                                    defeated and entirely dispersed. All the magazines had been
                                    destroyed the day following and the guns taken on board the
                                    fleet. On the day after the fleet commenced the attack the
                                    prince sent on board to sue for peace, but his agent having no
                                    plenipotentiary powers was sent back, and the next day a
                                    minister of the prince, with proper credentials, went on board
                                    the flag-ship of Admiral Kuper, and, in his master’s name, again
                                    sued for peace. At that interview it was proposed that the
                                    prince himself should come to Simonoseki, if he desired peace,
                                    and hold a conference with the senior naval officers to arrange
                                    the terms for a cessation of hostilities, with guarantees for
                                    the permanent maintenance of a free passage through the straits.
                                    In the mean time no hostilities on either side should be
                                    continued. It was then arranged that this conference should take
                                    place on shore on the 14th instant. The admirals afterwards
                                    steamed through the straits, visiting the several points where
                                    batteries had been erected, and which already had been
                                    dismantled by the allied forces.</p>
                                <p>From all which the British envoy observed there was this
                                    conclusion to be drawn: That the Prince of Choshu,
                                    notwithstanding all his vaunted power and long preparation in a
                                    position of great natural strength, had been utterly unable to
                                    defend his batteries against the allied forces, and in three
                                    days, all his troops having been defeated and dispersed, not a
                                    gun was left in any of his forts, and he himself had found it
                                    necessary to sue for peace. But there was another conclusion
                                    brought out by that which followed these events. The prince
                                    declared that hitherto he had only acted under the orders of the
                                    Mikado and the Tycoon; that he had no enmity against foreigners,
                                    but was perfectly willing to enter into friendly relations.</p>
                                <p>Such being the substance of the news brought by the Perseus, and
                                    the result of the operations against the Prince of Choshu, who
                                    had held the straits closed by batteries for fifteen months, it
                                    was now necessary to advert more especially to the prince’s
                                    alleged justification of this long violation of treaties. The
                                    prince not only declared that, as a Daimio of Japan, he had
                                    acted under the orders both of the Mikado and of the Tycoon in
                                    all that he had done, but he <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562"
                                        facs="0582"/>further produced certified copies in Japanese
                                    of these orders. The foreign representatives, under these
                                    circumstances, desired to know what answer the Tycoon’s
                                    government had to make to this direct charge of complicity.</p>
                                <p>Takemoto Kai-no-kami replied that he would shortly have something
                                    to say on this subject, but would be glad first to hear anything
                                    which the representatives might further have to communicate.</p>
                                <p>The French minister said he was of opinion, in concert with all
                                    his colleagues, that the present was a very critical moment in
                                    the relations between foreign countries and Japan, and that the
                                    time had arrived for a total change in those relations. Hitherto
                                    the foreign representatives had suspected that the Tycoon, under
                                    the pressure of many difficulties, had been led to play a double
                                    part, which, however calculated in one point of view to secure
                                    his safety, was on the other full of peril to the foreigners in
                                    Japan, and, as they conceived, not without some danger to
                                    himself. He had often seemed to be playing into the hands of the
                                    Daimios, most hostile to the maintenance of foreign relations,
                                    and to be seriously preparing to put a stop to these, while at
                                    the same time he professed to the several treaty powers a very
                                    earnest desire to maintain intact all the rights conferred by
                                    existing treaties. But now it was no longer a matter of
                                    suspicion, but of certainty; and the documents placed in the
                                    admiral’s hands prove that the whole of these outrages and
                                    flagrant violations of treaties by the Prince of Nagato were
                                    really the acts of the Mikado and Tycoon, since done under
                                    orders, which might easily be interpreted to sanction, if not to
                                    prescribe, the exact order of proceedings adopted by the prince.
                                    The time, therefore, had come for dropping all mask and adopting
                                    a totally different policy; and unless the Tycoon, strengthened
                                    and materially aided as he must be by this complete victory over
                                    the Prince of Nagato and by such support as the foreign
                                    representatives were in a position to render him, would
                                    undertake, without further temporizing, to put himself in accord
                                    with the superior authority of the Mikado in this matter of the
                                    treaties, obtain his sanction, and give entire execution to all
                                    their stipulations, an opportunity not likely to occur again
                                    would be lost in the Tycoon’s interest, not less than
                                    theirs.</p>
                                <p>Takemoto Kai-no-kami, in reply, stated that he fully agreed with
                                    the opinions just expressed; that this was a very critical
                                    moment, and it behooved the Tycoon’s government to take
                                    advantage of it in the way indicated. In regard to the charge
                                    made by the Prince of Choshu, and the written orders he produced
                                    in justification, he, Takemoto Kai-no-kami, had to remark—</p>
                                <p>1st. That the order, such as it was, had been transmitted, not by
                                    the Tycoon, but by an act of treachery on the part of persons,
                                    about the Mikado, and without competent authority.</p>
                                <p>2d. That it did not order the prince to fire upon foreign ships,
                                    and the proof that such was not its proper meaning might be
                                    found in the fact that although a similar order was communicated
                                    to all the other Daimios, he alone had put that interpretation
                                    upon it because it suited his own designs.</p>
                                <p>To this the American minister replied, that although it was true
                                    the order was not in express terms to fire, yet as it declared
                                    the intention of the Tycoon to cease all intercourse with
                                    foreigners on the 20th June, 1863, the prince might naturally
                                    draw the inference that he was expected to treat them as
                                    enemies.</p>
                                <p>Takemoto replied, that such acts were contrary to the Tycoon’s
                                    wish was further established by his sending down an aide-de-camp
                                    at once to cause the prince to stop firing, and this emissary
                                    was murdered in the territories of Choshu.</p>
                                <p>As to the appearance of double dealing on the part of the
                                    Tycoon’s government on the one side, concerting measures for the
                                    closing of the port of Yokohama, and, on the other, for
                                    maintaining the treaties in their integrity, the Tycoon had
                                    hitherto been, as the representatives well know, in a position
                                    to make something of this kind unavoidable, in the interest of
                                    foreigners as well <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0583"/>as
                                    for his own sake; since, had he openly refused to carry out the
                                    orders received from the Mikado for the expulsion of foreigners,
                                    he was liable to be deposed, and his dynasty might be destroyed.
                                    Now, however, that the Prince of Nagato had been defeated by the
                                    allied expedition, there was certainly a great opportunity for
                                    putting an end to whatever was ambiguous in the position of the
                                    Tycoon as regarded the foreign powers; but, in furtherance of
                                    such end, it was essential that the allied squadron should be
                                    recalled to prevent all chance of collision with other Daimios
                                    and new complications arising.</p>
                                <p>The American minister then observed, that it was evident from the
                                    tenor and urgency of this demand, which Takemoto had been no
                                    doubt instructed to make, that the Tycoon was still inclined to
                                    pursue the policy of conciliating the hostile party, whereas he
                                    now occupied a vantage ground, secured to him by the action of
                                    the treaty powers, which relieved him from such subservience. He
                                    was no longer under the necessity, which it was pleaded had
                                    hitherto controlled his free action, of presenting one face to
                                    the treaty powers, and another to his own subjects. The power of
                                    the hostile party was now broken, and the Tycoon was now able to
                                    act with security. He would accordingly be expected to prove his
                                    good faith, by strictly observing the engagement entered into by
                                    treaties, and no longer holding out expectations of their
                                    modification. The Tycoon must know, by this time, that such
                                    modifications as the hostile party contemplated would never be
                                    acceded to. So far as the Tycoon was concerned, the
                                    representatives present had indeed the assurance that they were
                                    only asked for the purpose of gaining time, and not with any
                                    hope of ultimate concession. The temporizing policy hitherto
                                    followed, however, had greatly aggravated the evils which the
                                    Tycoon professed to be desirous of remedying; and the safest
                                    course, as well as the wisest, would now be found in a faithful
                                    observance of treaties, without pretence at negotiation for
                                    their modification or apparent concessions to those who only
                                    sought their entire nullification.</p>
                                <p>Takemoto said, that believing, with the foreign representatives,
                                    the present time very favorable for efforts at Kioto to place
                                    the relations of Japan with foreign countries on a better
                                    footing, he was all the more anxious that the fleet should
                                    immediately return, and especially that no troops should be left
                                    to occupy any post in the Inland sea, lest new complications or
                                    collisions should arise which might seriously interfere with the
                                    success of efforts now to be made.</p>
                                <p>The British minister replied, that it had been determined by
                                    common consent to keep an effective hold upon the straits until
                                    satisfactory arrangements were entered into by the Tycoon’s
                                    government, both as to the navigation of the Inland sea and the
                                    better maintenance of treaty rights generally. Either the Tycoon
                                    must find the means of bringing the Mikado and hostile party of
                                    Daimios in accord with him for the maintenance of treaties, or
                                    the western powers might find themselves compelled to go beyond
                                    the Tycoon, and enter into relations with the Mikado. It has
                                    been already suggested that a new order of things might at once
                                    be established, if the Tycoon would take advantage of the recent
                                    blow dealt at the Sako party in the person of Choshu. Advantage
                                    might also be taken of the intimation now conveyed, that unless
                                    some agreement could be come to on the subject of treaties
                                    between the various conflicting powers in Japan, foreign states
                                    might, however reluctantly, find themselves compelled, in
                                    self-defence, to take steps which would bring them in more or
                                    less direct relation with the Mikado, and those Daimios who had
                                    hitherto supported him in a hostile course of action. Hitherto
                                    the Tycoon had always been considered as the treaty-making power
                                    in Japan, and the sole representative of government in relation
                                    with foreign states; but it is continued to be demonstrated that
                                    the Tycoon has not the necessary authority, and was so
                                    completely overruled by a superior power in the state as to be
                                    unable to prevent or resist orders for the rupture of treaties,
                                    however well disposed he might be to <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564"
                                        facs="0584"/>maintain them. Foreign powers would sooner or
                                    later have no alternative hut to seek the superior power in the
                                    state and make their own terms.</p>
                                <p>Takemoto Kai-no-kami observed that, agreeing in much that had
                                    been suggested, he was nevertheless not in a position to make
                                    any definite answer in so grave a matter. He would, therefore,
                                    at once proceed to Yedo, to report all that had been said. In
                                    the mean time he must still urge the importance of immediately
                                    recalling the fleet to prevent all chance of new collisions.</p>
                                <p>The French minister wished to ask Takemoto two or three
                                    question’s: First, if the Tycoon could now obtain the full
                                    concurrence and support of the Mikado in the maintenance of
                                    foreign relations and existing treaties, would the Tycoon then
                                    find it possible to give them full effect, and to deal with any
                                    recalcitrant or rebellious Baimios, now especially that Satsuma
                                    and Choshu, two of the most powerful having tried their strength
                                    against foreign powers and failed, were no longer hostile.</p>
                                <p>Takemoto answered without hesitation, Yes, certainly.</p>
                                <p>The French minister then asked whether it would not be very
                                    inconvenient to the Mikado to receive the foreign
                                    representatives in Kioto.</p>
                                <p>Takemoto smiled and said, Undoubtedly it would be very
                                    inconvenient.</p>
                                <p>Then, continued the French minister, would it not be much better
                                    for the Tycoon to profit by this opportunity so happily afforded
                                    by the recent defeat of the Prince of Nagato, and the great
                                    discouragement it must be to the Sako party, and prevent any
                                    necessity arising for such a step?</p>
                                <p>To which Takemoto replied also in the affirmative; observing that
                                    such, indeed, would be the desire of the Tycoon, and he,
                                    Takemoto, would immediately hasten to Yedo that the Gorogio and
                                    Tycoon might be informed, without delay, of all that had passed,
                                    and of the whole bearing of the important events which had taken
                                    place in the straits.</p>
                                <p>The British minister summed up by saying it was desirable the
                                    high officers now present should return to Yedo impressed with
                                    two leading facts: First, that the time had arrived for a total
                                    and radical changer of policy on the part of the Tycoon in
                                    respect to the Sako party and the foreign powers; abandoning all
                                    attempts to temporize with and conciliate the former by seeming
                                    to consent to measures for the expulsion of foreigners one day,
                                    or by the stoppage of the trade another.</p>
                                <p>This, it was observed incidentally by the representative of the
                                    Netherlands, had been done in regard to the silk coming to this
                                    port quite recently, and it ought to be allowed to come forward
                                    at once as a first indication of this change of policy.</p>
                                <p>Takemoto replied affirmatively, and that steps were taken to that
                                    end.</p>
                                <p>And secondly, the British envoy then continued, he trusted they
                                    would leave the conference with the conviction that it was
                                    impossible for foreign powers any longer to let their rights and
                                    national interests in the country be perpetually damaged and
                                    sacrificed between the two conflicting authorities of the Mikado
                                    and Tycoon. It followed, therefore, that either the Tycoon must
                                    find means to reconcile the two, and successfully assert his
                                    power to execute the treaties fully, or measures must be taken
                                    into the consideration of foreign governments for arriving at a
                                    satisfactory result by other means than representations to the
                                    Tycoon, courteously listened to always, but wholly
                                    inoperative.</p>
                                <p>In the mean while, anxious to give every support to the Tycoon in
                                    his efforts tending to this end; desirous of avoiding any cause
                                    of embarrassment that might interfere with his action in this
                                    direction; willing, even, to strengthen Takemoto’s hands in the
                                    arduous work on which he had now been employed, he might go back
                                    to the Tycoon with the assurance that the admirals would
                                    speedily return with the greater part of the force; and no
                                    permanent position would at present be taken on shore to command
                                    the straits. On the other hand, having at no slight cost
                                    obtained such important results, as the removal of all the
                                    impediments <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0585"/>to the free
                                    navigation and the submission of the Prince of Nagato, it was
                                    out of the question their immediately relinquishing these
                                    material and political results, or exposing them to any
                                    jeopardy. A certain number of ships, therefore, would remain in
                                    the vicinity of Simonoseki to secure the free passage and strict
                                    maintenance of the terms on which peace would be granted to the
                                    prince.</p>
                                <p>The American minister observed, further, that it would be a
                                    question now whether, after the past experience, it was not
                                    essential to prevent the liability of the straits being closed
                                    at the caprice of any single Daimio.</p>
                                <p>To do this effectually, it might be necessary that so much of the
                                    territories of the prince as should be required to secure
                                    foreign trade henceforth from any such contingency should be
                                    imperialized and made over to the Tycoon’s keeping. Whether,
                                    also, Simonoseki or some other port in its vicinity should not
                                    be made a port for foreign trade was matter now for
                                    deliberation.</p>
                                <p>As some indemnity for the sacrifices made by the four treaty
                                    powers to secure the removal of long existing obstructions and
                                    the injury done to foreign trade during the past fifteen months,
                                    the four treaty powers might reasonably require it from the
                                    Tycoon, and the Tycoon might be disposed to make this
                                    arrangement of his own accord, and the more willingly that there
                                    was reason to believe the concession, if now insisted upon by
                                    the admirals, could be at once obtained from the Prince of
                                    Choshu, as Daimio of the province.</p>
                                <p>The British minister observed, in conclusion, that it would be
                                    necessary for the representatives then present to confer in
                                    person with the Gorogio on this and other important matters
                                    connected with the present aspect of affairs. These subjects
                                    were distinctly mentioned now, therefore, that when the meeting
                                    took place the members of the Gorogio might not be taken by
                                    surprise and require time for deliberation, but be prepared at
                                    once to enter into the discussion of the proper measures to be
                                    taken.</p>
                                <p>Takemoto Kai-no-kami said he perfectly under stood all that had
                                    been said, and, with his colleagues, would hasten back to Yedo
                                    to render an account of his mission.</p>
                                <p>The conference was then closed.</p>

                            <head><hi rend="italic">Memorandum of a conference with Takemoto
                                    Kai-no-kami, principal governor for foreign affairs and
                                    confidential agent of the Tycoon; Shibata Hinga-no-kami,
                                    governor for foreign affairs, and Idsuri Shinzabaro Ometske, at
                                    the British legation, September</hi> 23, 1864.</head>
                            <p>It was announced, on the part of the Tycoon and Gorogio, that it had
                                been finally resolved to abandon the temporizing and double-faced
                                policy hitherto adopted, and from henceforth to cease making any
                                pretence even of closing the port of Yokohama, and a member of the
                                Gorogio would at once proceed to Kioto to make this known to the
                                Mikado, and obtain his sanction to the public renunciation of such a
                                policy, and, if possible, his acceptance and ratification of the
                                treaties.</p>
                            <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0586"/>
                            <p>In accordance with this resolution, it was further stated, and as a
                                material proof of good faith, that all restriction on the trade of
                                this port should at once cease. A large quantity of silk was already
                                on its way, and to be expected in a day or two. These two
                                resolutions, they were directed to state, are the first results
                                arrived at in consequence of the representations made by the four
                                representatives in the conference of the 18th instant, when the news
                                of the defeat of Choshu was communicated. But as the determination
                                to take no further steps In the closing of this port cannot be made
                                public until it has been formally communicated to the Mikado, a
                                vice-minister will be Bent to Yokohama to acquaint the foreign
                                ministers privately.</p>
                            <p>In the mean time it was the anxious desire of the Gorogio that all
                                the foreign ships should be withdrawn from the straits, as their
                                presence interfered with the operations of the Daimios and Tycoon
                                against Choshu.</p>
                            <p>In reference to which, the convention of Choshu and the question of
                                indemnities was spoken of; Takemoto was informed that these, if
                                pressed, would no doubt amount to a very considerable sum. It was
                                not the desire of her Majesty’s government, however, to extort money
                                from either the Tycoon or the Daimios. Their earnest wish was rather
                                to establish good relations for the advantage of both nations, and
                                it was believed that the other treaty powers entertained similar
                                views. As to the withdrawal of the ships from the straits at this
                                moment, therefore, if the Tycoon chose to enter upon negotiation on
                                the following basis, the objection at present existing to the
                                withdrawal of the last ship might possibly be removed:</p>
                            <p>The Tycoon to take upon himself the satisfactory arrangement of the
                                whole of the indemnities claimed, or to be claimed, for the past by
                                the four powers from Choshu, and to engage either to pay the amount,
                                or make arrangements for the opening of the port of Simonoseki (or
                                some other port more convenient in the vicinity) in lieu of such
                                payment, at the option of the treaty powers.</p>
                            <p>The same high officers having proceeded to the French legation, a
                                conference on the subject took place with the French minister, who
                                had the above minute before him.</p>
                            <p>In the first instance, Takemoto Kai-no-kami repeated the desire of
                                the Gorogio that all the ships should be withdrawn from the straits,
                                insisting much upon the obstruction their presence would be to the
                                operations then contemplated against Choshu on the part of the
                                Tycoon and Daimios summoned to his aid.</p>
                            <p>The French minister replied that if hostilities had not been pushed
                                further against Choshu, it was because the Tycoon especially
                                requested it, undertaking himself to complete the work to the
                                satisfaction of the representatives. They ought to be well assured,
                                therefore, of the sincerity of the Tycoon’s promises, for there was
                                reparation due, indemnities to be recovered, and, secondly,
                                guarantees for the future yet wanting. But, beyond these, there was
                                something vastly more important to be secured, and that was the
                                ratification of existing treaties by the Mikado, and this with the
                                least possible delay. The non-ratification of the treaties had been
                                a perpetual cause of difficulties, since the Tycoon’s government
                                unceasingly made it the plea for their non-execution. Now there
                                could never be a more propitious movement, or a more favorable
                                opportunity for obtaining their immediate ratification. The means of
                                communication with Kioto existed; the time required was short, and
                                assuredly without this being obtained it was idle to talk of the
                                recall of the ships.</p>
                            <p>To this Takemoto observed that their presence in the straits
                                interfering with the Mikado’s orders for the punishment of Choshu
                                might prove an obstacle in the way of the ratification.</p>
                            <p>The minister of France replied it was difficult to conceive this. It
                                appeared to him, on the contrary, that the Mikado, being almost
                                within hearing of the foreign artillery, would be disposed all the
                                more readily to listen to the demands of the Tycoon, who could very
                                well use the presence of the fleet as an <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567"
                                    facs="0587"/>argument, showing that the ratification had at last
                                become a matter of necessity, supposing that the Tycoon should still
                                hesitate boldly to avow the policy of maintaining the treaties as
                                the only course consistent with good faith or policy, and the
                                engagements entered into with foreign powers, engagements which even
                                at this moment had been renewed with their representatives.</p>
                            <p>Takemoto observed that this might be a very dangerous part for the
                                Tycoon to play, as likely to arouse the hostility of the Daimios
                                against foreign nations by an appearance of intimidation.</p>
                            <p>The minister remarked that a similar argument had been used to deter
                                the representatives from sending the allied squadrons against
                                Choshu, and no such result had followed. But apart from this, was it
                                not evidently and urgently in the interest of the Tycoon himself
                                that the ships of the treaty powers should keep careful watch of the
                                movements of Choshu, and prevent his re-arming his batteries, which
                                it had not been thought worth while to destroy? Once rearmed, all
                                the junks of the Daimios, north or south, would be certain to be
                                sunk by his guns, and their attack might fail.</p>
                            <p>Takemoto and his colleagues appeared much impressed with this
                                observation, and admitted it was one of great weight, and deserving
                                serious consideration, but that in so grave a matter they could only
                                promise to report to the government at Yedo.</p>
                            <p>The minister remarked, besides, that his experience of military
                                matters satisfied him that such an expedition as was announced on
                                the part of the Tycoon and Daimios could not possibly be ready under
                                two months, and one month should suffice to obtain the Mikado’s
                                ratification of the treaties. It would then be time enough to
                                discuss whether the ships were an obstacle to theiroperations or
                                not.</p>
                            <p>Takemoto replied that, as far as his own opinion went, he was
                                satisfied of the expediency of leaving them for the present, but he
                                must, of course, refer the whole question to the Gorogio.</p>
                            <p>The minister assented, observing that it must be evident there was
                                between the British minister and himself, in all this matter, a
                                perfect identity of opinion, and that their resolutions had been
                                definitively taken. And in conclusion, he wished to know when the
                                promised silk would arrive.</p>
                            <p>Takemoto replied: To-morrow, if the weather was fine. It was already
                                at Kanagawa, in quantity.</p>

                                envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary; Monsieur Leon
                                Roches, minister plenipotentiary of his Imperial Majesty the Emperor
                                of the French; Robert H. Pruyn, minister resident of the United

                                Idsumo-no-kami; also, the governors for foreign affairs, and
                                Takemoto Awadji-no-kami, confidential agent of the Tycoon, and
                                principal governor for foreign affairs.</p>
                            <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0588"/>
                            <p>The British minister informed the Gorogio that in all the
                                observations he had to offer for their consideration upon the
                                occasion, he should speak not in his own name only, but as conveying
                                the opinion of his three colleagues also. It was the more essential
                                this should be understood, for they were now assembled under no
                                ordinary circumstances. The critical situation of affairs in Japan,
                                and the important interests at stake, make it imperative that a
                                decision should be taken without delay as to the foreign policy of
                                the country, and upon that decision must very much depend the
                                possibility of maintaining good and friendly relations with the
                                treaty powers.</p>
                            <p>The first minister for foreign affairs, Midsumo Idsumi-no-kami,
                                replied, that the members of the Gorogio were fully impressed with
                                the gravity of the situation. They hoped, however, that it would be
                                possible to arrive at a peaceful solution of all the questions on
                                which they had hitherto been at issue.</p>
                            <p>The British minister, adverting to the recent destruction of all
                                Choshu’s defences, and his total defeat, observed that it must now
                                be manifest no hostile Daimio was strong enough to resist such
                                forces as the treaty powers could command, and from this conviction
                                the four representatives hoped much good would result. At Kagosima
                                and Simonoseki proof had now been given that the treaty powers both
                                could and would vindicate their rights by the sword, when either the
                                lives or the trade of their subjects were attacked. Neither hostile
                                Daimios of the Sako party, the Mikado himself, nor the Tycoon, could
                                any longer be under the illusion that a hostile policy towards
                                foreign powers might be carried out with impunity, or, indeed,
                                without entailing all the calamities of a general war and a conflict
                                with western powers, in which Japan could not hope to be victor. In
                                the mean time, they had first to consider the position of affairs in
                                respect to the Prince of Nagato. This Daimio, after a series of
                                unprovoked aggressions on foreign ships, and continuous interruption
                                of trade by every kind of violence, had been punished, his batteries
                                dismantled, and the guns employed in such outrages taken away from
                                him. Finding his utter powerlessness in face of such a force as had
                                been sent against him, he had promptly sued for a cessation of
                                hostilities, and entered into a convention with the admiral
                                commanding-in-chief, to pay all the expenses of the expedition,
                                together with any indemnities to be claimed for his aggressions on
                                foreign flags since the beginning. The first thing to be ascertained
                                was whether the Tycoon would undertake to meet these claims, and
                                liquidate them, as agreed upon by the Prince of Nagato.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese minister replied, that Choshu was going to be punished
                                for his offences against his own sovereign. His territories would be
                                confiscated, and out of his estate the expenses of the expedition
                                would be defrayed.</p>
                            <p>The British minister replied, that this did not meet his question.
                                Would the Tycoon take upon himself the responsibility of carrying
                                out the convention in regard to the payment of all indemnities? If
                                so, the engagement must be wholly irrespective of the result of any
                                operations of the Tycoon against Choshu, which might be long delayed
                                or incomplete in their results. Choshu had also expressed his
                                willingness to allow trade to be carried on at Simonoseki; and it
                                seemed, therefore, only to rest with the Tycoon whether this port
                                might not at once be opened. Without, however, insisting upon this
                                point at present, the representatives must have a formal and
                                unconditional engagement from the government of the Tycoon to meet
                                all the claims for indemnities against Choshu, or they must of
                                necessity look to him to meet his own obligations.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese ministers, after some consultation among themselves,
                                replied that the Tycoon’s government would unconditionally undertake
                                the engagements of Choshu, as to the payment of all indemnities. As
                                to the opening of the port of Simonoseki, it would be impossible for
                                them to return any answer until they knew the result of a mission
                                with which Abe Bungo-no-kami, the absent member of the Gorogio, had
                                been charged, and who was then at Kioto.</p>
                            <p>The British minister observed, that the root of all evil in respect
                                to foreign <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0589"/>relations was
                                the want of accord between the Mikado and the Tycoon; and that the
                                time had now arrived when the ratification of existing treaties by
                                the Mikado could no longer be deferred. He trusted this was the
                                object of Abe Bungo-no-kami’s mission.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese minister replied, We cannot give you any promises on
                                this point, but every effort will, be made on our part to obtain the
                                Mikado’s ratification. We perfectly agree with you that it should
                                now take place.</p>
                            <p>The British minister, after communication with his colleagues,
                                stated, as their united opinion, that something more definite,
                                within a fixed period, should be promised.</p>
                            <p>The members of the Gorogio were evidently under some embarrassment,
                                and showed hesitation in entering further into the matter in
                                presence of all the Japanese officials present.</p>
                            <p>The British minister then observed, that as there was much of a very
                                grave and confidential character which he and his colleagues wished
                                to communicate freely to the Gorogio, and to them alone, in the
                                first instance, it might be better if the conference were adjourned
                                to the following day, when the British and American ministers would
                                come alone, two hours before their colleagues, who would be
                                accompanied by the naval officers of the squadrons, as previously
                                agreed upon.</p>
                            <p>This was agreed to by the Japanese ministers, after assuring
                                themselves that, although there would be only two of the foreign
                                representatives present, they would speak in the name of all, with
                                full power to act for and on behalf of their absent colleagues.</p>
                            <p>The Gorogio was then informed, that in view of the gravity of the
                                situation, and the absolute necessity for some immediate resolution
                                in regard to the foreign policy of Japan, each of the foreign
                                ministers had felt it his duty to address a letter to the Tycoon,
                                which they requested might be at once delivered. The Gorogio would
                                find that the foreign representatives had submitted certain
                                suggestions and opinions similar to those already known to the
                                members of the council; and they hoped, therefore, that before the
                                conference of the morrow it would be possible for the Gorogio to
                                take the Tycoon’s instructions, and enter fully into the whole
                                matter.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese ministers replied, that the letters which were now
                                placed in their hands should be at once delivered, and by to-morrow,
                                at noon, they hoped to have received the Tycoon’s instructions.</p>
                            <p>The conference then broke up, with an adjournment to the following
                                day, at 12 o’clock.</p>

                            <p>Present: The British and American ministers; the following members of
                                the Gorogio: Midsumo Idsumi-no-kami, Makino Bidzen-no-kami, Suwa
                                Inaba-no-kami; and the members of the second council: Sakai
                                Hida-no-kami, Tachibano Idsumo-no-kami; also, governor for foreign
                                affairs, and Takemoto Awadji-no-kami, Shibazu-no-kami.</p>
                            <p>The British minister opened the conference by referring to the
                                understanding come to on the previous day in respect to the Tycoon
                                formally engaging to liquidate all claims for indemnities against
                                the Prince of Nagato.</p>
                            <p>After some conversation, it was agreed that a letter to that effect,
                                to be signed by the ministers, should at once be written and
                                delivered; and for the assessments of the amounts, time, and mode of
                                payment, and other details, commissioners <pb n="570"
                                    xml:id="pg_570" facs="0590"/>with plenipotentiary powers should
                                be sent to Yokohama, within eight days, to treat with the foreign
                                representatives, and settle the whole matter.</p>
                            <p>The British minister, then referring to the numerous confidential
                                conferences which had taken place between Takemoto Awadji-no-kami
                                and himself, as well as with his colleagues, sometimes separately
                                and at others collectively, said that he had much desired an
                                occasion like the present, of pressing upon the attention of the
                                Gorogio <hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi> the many important
                                considerations which he conceived should at this moment determine
                                the foreign policy of the Tycoon’s government.</p>
                            <p>The ministers, with every manifestation of interest, expressed their
                                willingness to hear whatever it was desired to communicate to
                                them.</p>
                            <p>The British minister said the foreign representatives had three
                                principal objects in view when they determined in concert to demand
                                a conference with the whole Gorogio, and to proceed to Yedo
                                collectively for the purpose.</p>
                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> had reference to a long series of
                                outrages and aggressions on the part of the Prince of Nagato. He had
                                now paid the penalty of his temerity, and been defeated in the
                                field. The ulterior question of indemnities might now also be
                                considered as satisfactorily settled, by the written engagement of
                                the Tycoon’s government to take upon themselves the final adjustment
                                and liquidation. The letter to this effect was delivered during the
                                conference, with the seal of Makino Bidzen-no-kami, in whose house
                                the conference took place, and the only one, consequently, who was
                                prepared with it, but with the assurance, personally given, that it
                                was the act of the whole Gorogio.</p>
                            <p>The second had reference to a subject on which the representatives
                                had barely touched yesterday, because they saw it was productive of
                                embarrassment; indeed, they knew that its discussion in public could
                                not be satisfactorily conducted. This subject was the disaccord
                                between the Mikado and Tycoon on the question of a foreign policy,
                                and between the Tycoon and a powerful party of Daimios perpetually
                                urging the closing of the port as the condition of peace in the
                                realm.</p>
                            <p>The head of this party had now been dealt a paralyzing blow by the
                                foreign squadrons, by which his power and his prestige both must
                                have been greatly diminished. The whole party even must have
                                suffered great damage and been discouraged. Simultaneously they must
                                have lost influence with the Mikado by the treasonable attack of
                                Choshu upon his castle, and the destruction of half his capital.
                                There could not be a more favorable conjuncture, therefore, for the
                                successful prosecution of a negotiation with the Mikado for the
                                ratification of the treaties and the recovery of an ascendancy by
                                the Tycoon over the Daimios hitherto so hostile to his policy and to
                                all foreign relations.</p>
                            <p>The Gorogio knew what was the general outline of a policy indicated
                                to Takemoto, by which the foreign representatives conceived all
                                parties might be conciliated, and a foreign policy established
                                calculated to maintain good relations with the treaty powers, and
                                put an end to all hostile combinations against them and the Tycoon
                                on the part of the Daimios. This policy, it was explained, consisted
                                in giving both the Mikado and the Daimios a personal interest in the
                                maintenance of these relations and the development of trade, and in
                                removing some of the causes of hostility where their prejudices were
                                most hurt by particular treaty stipulations.</p>
                            <p>The ministers, while this was being very fluently interpreted by Mr.
                                Von Seibold, manifested in various ways the deepest interest in the
                                views submitted, and begged to hear further by what means it was
                                conceived these great ends could be attained.</p>
                            <p>The British minister continued: The Mikado might easily be given a
                                personal interest in the maintenance of treaties and prosperity of
                                trade by assigning to him, as a portion of the revenue paid to him
                                by the Tycoon, a royalty constituted by a percentage on the gross
                                receipts of the custom-houses at the open ports. The Daimios might
                                in like manner be conciliated by withdrawing all <pb n="571"
                                    xml:id="pg_571" facs="0591"/>vexatious restrictions and
                                exactions prohibitory of their produce being sold at the Tycoon’s
                                ports. These restrictions were not only in violation of distinct
                                treaty stipulations, but wholly opposed to the Tycoon’s true
                                interests; for, as the event proved, this system had raised him up
                                such powerful enemies that they placed his life and throne in
                                danger, and were clamoring for the closing of ports and cessation of
                                a trade in the advantages of which they were not allowed to
                                participate, while in various ways they had been made to feel the
                                inconveniences attaching to all great and sudden innovations in the
                                policy of a country.</p>
                            <p>The ministers, after much interchange of opinion among themselves,
                                and a more animated conference with individual expressions of
                                thought and evidence of lively interest than had ever been witnessed
                                by any foreign representatives in Japan, replied that they had been
                                much impressed with the line of policy traced out, and that, as
                                regarded the hostilities of the Daimios, it was already in
                                contemplation to move in this direction. But as regarded the Mikado
                                it was a delicate subject, and they could hardly say yet how far
                                such a policy would be feasible.</p>
                            <p>The American minister here observed that by no other means could the
                                Mikado’s interest in trade be more effectually secured, and, in
                                consequence, his interest in putting down the hostility of any of
                                the Sako party, since it would be open to the Tycoon at any time, if
                                they made themselves, troublesome, to represent to the Mikado that
                                in so far as they might succeed in the interruption they diminished
                                the amount of duties received, and of necessity diminished the
                                revenue which he had to pay over to the Mikado, this being formed by
                                a percentage on the whole.</p>
                            <p>The members of the two councils seized on this point with much
                                interest, and evidently saw how valuable such an argument might
                                become.</p>
                            <p>The British minister added, that among the means to be used both with
                                the Mikado and Daimios to bring them in accord with the Tycoon, and
                                to lead them to accept an enlightened policy, it must not be
                                forgotten that there were some arguments which appealed to their
                                patriotism, and others to their interests in a different way.</p>
                            <p>To the Mikado it might very truly be represented that not only were
                                all the perils and calamities to the country inseparable from a war
                                with western powers to be averted by his prompt ratification of the
                                treaties at a moment when longer delay would be fraught with danger,
                                but if even this by any more temporizing measures could be avoided,
                                it was very certain the treaty powers, seeing all the conditions
                                unfulfilled upon which alone they made the large concession of
                                deferring the opening of two cities and three ports, Hiogo and
                                Osacca, among others, would, at no long interval, if the present
                                negotiations failed, insist, as was their undoubted right, upon the
                                full execution of the original treaties, and the opening of these
                                ports without further delay. If, on the other hand, the Mikado,
                                moved by these and other weighty considerations, should determine on
                                at once ratifying the treaties, the foreign powers would not only be
                                more inclined to take patience, but their represenatives on the spot
                                would see in this the sure promise of peace and future improved
                                relations. The British minister would at once, for his own part, on
                                hearing of such an act of ratification begin to send away the
                                British troops now collected at Yokohama, solely there to meet the
                                danger created by the hostile action of the Mikado and Daimios, and
                                thus material evidence would be given of a sense of security, which
                                would do more to restore confidence and allay disturbance throughout
                                the country than any number of decrees and proclamations.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese ministers seemed fully to understand and to appreciate
                                the bearing and force of these remarks, and said that they would
                                spare no effort to obtain the Mikado’s acceptance of the treaties,
                                and to this end were about to despatch another envoy, whom they then
                                begged to present to the British and American ministers.</p>
                            <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0592"/>
                            <p>It was here suggested that if the Gorogio, while one of their number,
                                or the Tycoon himself, was engaged with the Mikado, at Kioto, in
                                this negotiation, were to remove to Osacca, and the foreign
                                representatives also, with a portion of the squadron, were to be in
                                the bay of Hioga, so that they could have easy access to each other
                                and frequent intercourse, not only much advantage and more rapid
                                progress in the negotiation would be attained, from the proximity of
                                Osacca to Kioto, but the mere presence of both ministers and ships
                                in that vicinity might have a good effect, as showing the urgency of
                                the occasion, and thus strengthen the hands of the Tycoon’s
                                government.</p>
                            <p>The ministers objected to this, that it would look like a
                                menace—would certainly be liable to be so construed both by the
                                Mikado and the Daimios, and it would expose the Tycoon to the charge
                                of attempting, with foreign powers, to coerce and force the Mikado,
                                thus raising an insuperable obstacle to the success of the
                                negotiations.</p>
                            <p>The British minister said it would not be the wish of the foreign
                                representatives to insist, if such was the deliberate opinion of the
                                members of both councils. Nevertheless, some definite period, say
                                thirty days, must be fixed, within which an answer from Kioto or
                                some result should be obtained; because, if the negotiation now
                                going on there should not be successful, it would, undoubtedly, be
                                the duty of the foreign representatives to lay before their
                                respective governments such a statement of the untenable nature of
                                the actual situation as would be calculated to lead them to adopt
                                some decisive and serious resolution.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese ministers expressed their acquiescence in this view.
                                They hoped the end would be attained long before thirty days, in
                                which case they would hasten to communicate it. One means of success
                                they had yet to obtain from the foreign representatives, and that
                                was the withdrawal of the ships-of-war from the straits of
                                Simonoseki. If their envoy, now proceeding to Kioto, could convey
                                this intelligence, it would, they thought, go far to insure a
                                sucessful issue.</p>
                            <p>The British minister replied, that before the conference terminated
                                an answer should be given; but, in the mean time, of the three main
                                objects which had led to this conference, he had only as yet touched
                                upon two, namely, the termination of the affair of Choshu, and the
                                necessity of accord between the Mikado and Tycoon on the subject of
                                treaties and foreign relations. The third was not less important
                                than the first and second; indeed, it was much more important than
                                the first. The restrictions in trade and the vexatious obstructions
                                and exactions to which foreign trade was subject at all the ports,
                                and latterly the total stoppage of silk—a main staple of the trade
                                of Yokohama—had reached such a pitch that it was imperative there
                                should be a prompt and radical change. The government of the Tycoon
                                had already been informed last year that the closing of a treaty
                                port would be considered as constituting an act of war, but the
                                stoppage of the trade of a port, or any considerable portion of it,
                                was virtually the closing of the port; it was only a question of
                                degree and method. The wrong was the same; the injury inflicted and
                                the violation of treaty rights no less flagrant. This wrong and
                                injury had now been suffered at the hands of the Tycoon’s government
                                by the merchants of Yokohama for more than three months in the great
                                staple of silk, and it was the duty of the representatives to
                                represent to the Gorogio that it mattered not what was the plea,
                                there could be no justification; and if all restrictions were not
                                forthwith removed, they would, however reluctantly, be compelled to
                                conclude there was no faith or trust to be placed in the Tycoon’s
                                government. Takemoto, in the name of the Gorogio, had distinctly
                                promised all obstructions should cease more than fifteen days back,
                                and still they were maintained.</p>
                            <p>The ministers entered into rather a vague disclaimer, seeking to
                                throw the blame on competing native dealers, but in the end they
                                admitted that the government was not without some direct action in
                                the matter. They repeatedly <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0593"
                                />and emphatically assured the representatives, however, that the
                                restrictions had been already removed and should not again be
                                imposed.</p>
                            <p>The British minister replied that he would trust to their good faith,
                                and that they would scarcely venture to continue the same dubious
                                course after their solemn assurances. And in that trust the force at
                                Simonoseki should be immediately removed. But in giving them this
                                material evidence of good will and trust the representatives
                                expected, and would insist on having like material evidence in the
                                free and unrestricted supply of silk; failing this, the Gorogio must
                                know, the same power that withdrew the ships could send them back
                                again.</p>
                            <p>The minister gave renewed assurances that the silk was already going
                                into Yokohama—that the representatives would find this to be so when
                                they returned.</p>
                            <p>The British minister then observed that there was much to be done
                                before the trade at these ports could be placed on a satisfactory
                                footing, and in accord with the treaties. These had been hitherto
                                very persistently violated in every essential, to the great injury
                                of foreign residents at all the ports, and of trade generally. A
                                radical change of system and of policy was required; but, as any
                                step in this direction would require a discussion of details as to
                                particular abuses, it was proposed that the commission about to be
                                sent to Yokohama with plenipotentiary powers to arrange the
                                settlement of indemnities, should also have instruction to confer
                                with the foreign representatives, and take decisive action for the
                                correction of all abuses. This as regarded all the ports, and the
                                improvement of local conditions imperatively required at the present
                                moment—more particularly, perhaps, at Yokohama, but in all more or
                                less—and not only as regarded trade but land and sanitary
                                arrangements, such as had been considered and assented to in
                                conference with the commissioner Sibata Hinga-no-kami, now present,
                                sent down for this purpose on the 8th of September last.</p>
                            <p>The ministers agreed that the commissioners about to be sent should
                                be so instructed, and duly empowered to carry into effect whatever
                                arrangements should be decided upon.</p>
                            <p>The British minister observed that, although a whole month had
                                elapsed since Sibata, together with the governor of Kanagawa, had
                                conferred with the American minister and himself, and agreed upon
                                certain measures as both reasonable and necessary for the
                                enlargement of the settlement in several directions—the buildings of
                                the abattives, the construction of a road away from the Tokaida, for
                                recreation and exercise, &amp;c.—not a single step had been taken
                                towards carrying them into execution. It was necessary, therefore,
                                to impress upon the Gorogio that any further delay or inaction in
                                all these matters should be looked upon by the foreign
                                representatives as a breach of faith on the part of the Gorogio, and
                                would only lead to complications which they must feel it was very
                                desirable, in the interest of both parties, to avoid.</p>
                            <p>The ministers replied, that all necessary instructions would be
                                given, and the requisitions of the foreign representatives should be
                                promptly attended to.</p>
                            <p>The British minister observed that, in order to insure this result,
                                it was thought very desirable that some one or more of the high
                                officers most familiar with the subject, and who had already
                                discussed it with the foreign representatives, should be sent to
                                Yokohama with plenipotentiary powers. Sakai Hida-no-kami, for
                                instance, had been employed on a similar commission, now three years
                                ago, and although they had to regret that many of the engagements
                                then entered into, and the material improvements determined upon,
                                remained yet to be carried out, they thought, for that very reason,
                                indeed, as well as from previous knowledge, Sakai would be a very
                                fit person to be appointed. The same might be said of Takemoto, and
                                of Sibata Hinga-no-kami, as employed on the last occasion—the
                                latter, especially, as having already understood and generally
                                acquiesced in the necessity and expediency of the amelioration and
                                improvements contemplated.</p>
                            <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0594"/>
                            <p>The ministers, after a good-humored disclaimer on the part of Sakai
                                of his being a fit person, agreed that the suggestion should be
                                borne in mind when the commission was named.</p>
                            <p>The British minister said it was impossible to enter into long
                                details at such a conference as to the manifest obstructions to
                                trade; nevertheless, one instance was worthy of special mention
                                because of its great importance. There had been a disease among the
                                silkworms over large districts in Europe, and a consequent
                                deficiency in the production of silk. It was all-important to get
                                fresh seed from this country, and yet every possible impediment had
                                been thrown in the way of those employed in obtaining them by the
                                Japanese officials. Now, as each silkworm lays thousands of eggs, it
                                is impossible that Japan could suffer by allowing of the export of
                                any quantity that could be required to replenish the seed in Europe.
                                Moreover, since the Japanese authorities rather objected to the
                                excessive demand for silk, there was no better means of diminishing
                                the demand from Europe than by taking care to keep up the European
                                stock of worms on which the home supply of silk depended.</p>
                            <p>The ministers replied, that silkworm eggs not being an article of
                                trade, no provision had been made for a foreign demand; but now that
                                it was known they were required, orders had been given to provide
                                for this unforeseen demand, and next year a plentiful supply might
                                be relied upon.</p>
                            <p>The British minister replied that he was glad to hear they had made
                                provision for the future; but even as regarded the present season,
                                the want in Europe was urgent, and he could not conceive any just
                                reason could exist for obstacles being raised in the expectation of
                                such small quantities as had actually been purchased.</p>
                            <p>The ministers replied that if the consuls applied for authority to
                                ship eggs already obtained, it should be granted.</p>
                            <p>The subject of a residence at Yedo was then discussed. The Gorogio
                                was informed that by treaty the residence of foreign representatives
                                should be at Yedo, and nowhere else. This was a right which the
                                treaty powers would certainly not relinquish, and, therefore, it was
                                true that the Tycoon’s government took some steps to enable the
                                representatives to resume their residence.</p>
                            <p>The ministers made some observations as to the difficulties from the
                                troubled state of the country, without, however, in any way calling
                                in question the right insisted upon.</p>
                            <p>The British minister remarked, in reply, that the choice of a site
                                was the first step, and there was no reason why that should not be
                                taken at once. As regards the already chosen Gotten Yama, it
                                appearing that strong objections existed on the part of the Daimios
                                to its occupation by the foreign ministers, they were not disposed
                                to insist upon that site being preserved, provided some others
                                equally eligible were placed at their disposal. As to the present
                                time, being one of trouble and unfavorable for the resumption by the
                                foreign representatives of their residence in Yedo, no legation
                                could be built under twelve months, and, therefore, even when a site
                                had been found, there would be a long interval, in which time, it
                                was to be hoped, a new policy would be finally established and all
                                hostile feelings at an end on the part of the Daimios.</p>
                            <p>The ministers agreed that it was necessary to set about choosing an
                                eligible site in lieu of Goten Yama, and promised to lose no time in
                                doing so.</p>
                            <p>The British minister said the understanding now come to, on the main
                                points discussed, was satisfactory, and as the officers of the
                                squadron were at hand, the confidential part of the conference might
                                be considered at an end; and, in proof of the trust he and his
                                colleagues were willing to place in the assurance now received, he
                                had to announce their departure, with their respective ships, the
                                following day. The Dutch consul general alone, and for his private
                                convenience it was believed, proposed remaining some time longer at
                                his residence, but his ships would all leave.</p>
                            <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0595"/>
                            <p>The ministers expressed their great satisfaction at the manner in
                                which all the grave and important matters under consideration had
                                been discussed and arranged, and renewed their assurances that
                                everything now agreed upon should be effectually carried out.</p>
                            <p>The French minister and the representative of the Netherlands shortly
                                after arrived with the commanders of the several ships of the allied
                                squadron, who were duly presented to the ministers; and, after some
                                conversation and a refection, the whole party took leave.</p>

                            <p>Ibara Kazuye, a Karo of the Prince of Nagato, accompanied by the
                                three officers, having applied for a passage on one of her Majesty’s
                                ships returning from the straits of Simonoseki, in order to
                                communicate with the representatives of the treaty powers at
                                Yokohama, the above officers arrived on board H. M. S. Barrossa, on
                                the 10th October, 1864; and the same day the First Karo and <pb
                                    n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0596"/>his councillor, Sunji
                                Tokuske-san-lei, were received at the British legation at a private
                                interview by H. M. envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary.
                                The minister resident of the United States joined shortly after the
                                interview began.</p>
                            <p>The Karo presented his credentials, in the form of a letter, signed
                                by the Prince of Nagato, (a copy annexed,) stating that peace having
                                now been established in the waters of Simonoseki, he had despatched
                                envoys to H. M.’s minister to pay his respects; and he requested
                                that they might be received and given a hearing.</p>
                            <p>The chief envoy, Ibara Kazuye, stated that the prince, his master,
                                had desired him to express his regret that hostilities had taken
                                place between his people and the foreign powers. In the course he
                                had taken, however, he had only been obeying orders—the orders of
                                the Mikado and Tycoon both; but now that peace had been established,
                                the prince was anxious it should be maintained, and it was his firm
                                resolve to do his best to prevent any interruption of existing
                                relations. In the mean time the Karo had it in command to represent
                                the impoverishment of the prince by reason of the enormous
                                expenditure incurred throughout his provinces by warlike munitions,
                                defences, and other preparations for war, which the order of the
                                Mikado and Tycoon had entailed. In reference, therefore, to the
                                indemnities claimed for the expense of the expedition, and for the
                                ransom of Simonoseki to the prince, he trusted the foreign
                                representatives would take into consideration the extreme difficulty
                                he would find in raising any large sums.</p>
                            <p>The envoy was informed, in reply, that as regarded the excuse offered
                                for a long-continued series of hostile acts on the part of the
                                prince, namely, that he had the orders of both the Mikado and
                                Tycoon, the prince must know very well that this was decreed by the
                                Tycoon, and it was believed by the Mikado also.</p>
                            <p>The envoy observed that textual copies of the orders had been given
                                to the admirals.</p>
                            <p>This, it was replied, did not materially alter the case, for those
                                orders, although they communicated a decision of the Mikado and
                                Tycoon to interrupt relations and cease all intercourse with
                                foreigners from a given date, (June 20, 1863,) did not explicitly
                                order any Daimio to fire upon foreign ships without notice or
                                warning; and the proof that such was not the necessary reading of
                                the order was to be found in the fact that no other Daimio had so
                                interpreted it or commenced hostilities.</p>
                            <p>The envoy stated, on the other hand, the fact that the Mikado, ten
                                days after the hostilities had commenced, sent an envoy to the
                                prince entirely approving of his conduct.</p>
                            <p>The Tycoon, at all events, it was remarked, had taken steps to stop
                                hostilities, and had sent an envoy to tell the prince he had
                                misinterpreted his order, but the envoy was killed in Choshu’s
                                territories, and the hostile action continued. If the prince had in
                                the beginning purely mistaken his instructions by over-zeal and
                                willingness to carry out the will of the Tycoon, why did he
                                persevere?</p>
                            <p>The envoy replied, his. master had no wish to impute blame to the
                                Tycoon, but the fact was the Mikado had never revoked his orders,
                                and the Tycoon in the beginning had approved. When the foreign
                                representatives sent down two of the prince’s people by the queen’s
                                ships, in August, with written communications, the prince
                                immediately despatched his son to Kioto to induce the Mikado to
                                revoke his order. Unfortunately some disturbances arose there,
                                excited by Lronins, in which the Karo and people of the prince got
                                mixed up, and so no access could be gained to the Mikado, and thus
                                the prince’s good intentions in respect to foreigners had been
                                frustrated. Thus the prince had been sacrificed. And when the fleet
                                came, he fought, as was his duty, but knowing very well he could not
                                single-handed cope with the foreign powers.</p>
                            <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0597"/>
                            <p>It was observed, in reply, that a different version of the whole
                                affair had reached the representatives; and if the Karo’s was the
                                correct one, it must be admitted the prince was a very unfortunate
                                man. But as regarded the indemnities, the representatives had taken
                                steps which left no further question on that head between the prince
                                and them. As representatives of treaty powers they were accredited
                                to the Tycoon, and treated only with his government in all ordinary
                                circumstances. That they had taken action with the prince himself
                                arose entirely from the exceptional condition in which they were
                                placed. He had attacked their ships and obstructed their passage
                                through the inland sea—and not only their ships, but all produce
                                going to Nagasaki, to the great detriment of foreign trade and in
                                direct violation of treaties. It was the Tycoon’s business and his
                                duty to put an end to such hostilities at once and afford full
                                redress. The Tycoon’s inaction, from whatever cause proceeding,
                                having lasted over fifteen months, without any reasonable hope of
                                change or improvement, the treaty powers had been compelled to do
                                themselves justice and open the straits with their own forces. That
                                once done, and the prince having sued for a cessation of
                                hostilities, and entered into engagements to keep the peace and give
                                no further cause of complaint, the relations of the foreign powers
                                reverted to their usual course. The representatives had accordingly
                                informed the Tycoon’s government of what had taken place and the
                                engagements entered into by the prince, demanding to be informed if
                                the Tycoon was prepared to take upon himself those engagements and
                                pay the indemnities and expenses to be recovered. The answer having
                                been in the affirmative, there was, as has been stated, no further
                                question or ground of negotiation between the prince and the foreign
                                representatives in respect to money indemnities.</p>
                            <p>The envoys appeared satisfied with the explanation of the actual
                                position of affairs, and begged that as their presence on shore
                                involved some danger, and might give rise to new complications with
                                the government of the Tycoon, the representatives present would be
                                pleased to transmit the several letters of credence addressed to
                                each, and communicate, in their name, what they had been directed to
                                state to each in person could they have had the opportunity.</p>
                            <p>After some conversation as to the means for returning them to their
                                homes by one of her Majesty’s ships, they took their leave.</p>

                            <p>Mori Daizen (father and son) had sent Tukuhara Etrigo and two more
                                officers of standing and rank to Kioto, where they attempted
                                violence, but did not succeed. They have, however, alarmed the
                                Emperor and brought miseries upon the citizens and country people.
                                This is a series of crimes which cannot be overlooked, and he must
                                be punished accordingly.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, of his titles and the name given to him by the Tycoon’s
                                ancestors he shall be deprived; and the country belonging to him,
                                the provinces <hi rend="italic">Suwo</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Nagato</hi>, shallboth be taken from him. He is now at liberty
                                to go where he likes; but if he does not obey this order, our forces
                                shall advance from their positions.</p>

                            <p>Having fired upon foreign ships in the straits of Simonoseki last
                                year, in obedience to the order of the Mikado and Tycoon, I cannot
                                understand why I was censured by the Tycoon’s government as having
                                done wrong in firing. This made it appear as if I had disobeyed the
                                orders of the Mikado; and my two retainers having returned a short
                                time ago with communications, (from the foreign ministers,) I became
                                desirous to refer again to the Mikado in order to obtain his
                                decision. Nagato-no-kami (son and heir to the Prince of Choshu) set
                                out for Kioto, but before he had arrived disturbances arose in the
                                capital which, I regret very much to say, obliged him to return
                                without having accomplished the end in view. I have sent Matsu
                                Shimakoso and Ito Shunske to explain to you, and I hope you will
                                understand that henceforth I will offer no opposition to the free
                                passage of the straits of Simonoseki.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to former despatches in relation
                            to the employment of the steamer Ta-kiang, I now enclose (No. 1) a copy
                            of the charter, and will draw on the government for the sum of $9,500,
                            payable in gold, in time to enable the owners to send forward the draft
                            by the next mail. As I am not sure whether the draft should be on the
                            State or Navy Department, I shall make it in the alternative, which will
                            enable the proper accounting officer to adjust and charge as may be
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>I have paid for the coal (enclosure No. 2) in order to save the
                            government from the loss of exchange, as that item had to be purchased
                            here, and have debited the department therefor the sum of $1,848 in a
                            special account I have opened, in which I have charged myself with the
                            sums paid by the Japanese government for indemnities. I will draw in the
                            same manner for that sum, so hat the State Department may have its
                            necessary credit if the whole expenses are to be charged to the Navy
                            Department. In this case an allowance should be made for exchange.</p>
                        <p>You will observe the price of the vessel, if lost, was fixed at $75,000.
                            She has been since sold for $108,000. She was chartered at the close of
                            a charter on behalf of the British government for less than two weeks to
                            bring troops to this port, for which 7,000 Shanghai taels were paid, and
                            the right was also reserved to the owners to carry freight. I think,
                            therefore, no objection can be made to the terms on which the charter
                            was effected by Captain Price and myself.</p>
                        <p>As the convention recently concluded with the Japanese government more
                            than provides for the payment of the expenses of the Ta-kiang and for
                            those of the Jamestown, which was assigned to the defence of this port,
                            as well as a large sum for indemnities, I presume the entire management
                            of the business will devolve on your department, and hope that my action
                            may be in all respects approved.</p>

                                party of the first part, do covenant and agree to charter and hire
                                said steamer Ta-kiang aforesaid on the terms and conditions
                                following, that is to say:</p>
                            <p>6. The said parties of the second part do engage to pay to the said
                                party of the first part, for the charter or freight of said Ta-kiang
                                during the voyage aforesaid, which shall not exceed the term of one
                                month from the date hereof, the sum of $9,500, lawful gold coin of
                                the United States, in their draft at thirty days’ sight on the
                                Secretary of the Navy of the United States, or on the Secretary of
                                State of the United States.</p>
                            <p>7. The parties of the second part do further agree to pay to the
                                party of the first part the cost at this port of all the coal
                                consumed by said vessel during the continuance of the charter.</p>
                            <p>8. The parties of the second part do further agree that the officers,
                                engineers, and crew now on board of the said Ta-kiang shall, for so
                                long as they remain under their contract, as by the terms of this
                                charter-party, be considered as in the service of the United States,
                                and, for any casualties incident to this employment, shall be
                                entitled to the same consideration and compensation as when in the
                                regular government service.</p>
                            <p>9. The parties of the second part do further agree that during the
                                continuance of this charter the said Ta-kiang, as to each and every
                                loss or damage that may accrue to her, is at the risk of the said
                                parties of the second part, (except as to those perils of the sea
                                covered and protected by her policy of marine insurance,) and that
                                all such loss or damage, incident to her employment under this
                                charter-party, shall be made good to the party of the first part,
                                and the said vessel shall be returned to this port of Kanagawa in as
                                good order and condition as when chartered, ordinary wear and tear
                                excepted.</p>
                            <p>10. And it is further agreed between the parties to this instrument,
                                that, in case of a total loss of the Ta-kiang while employed under
                                this charter, the measure of damages which shall be paid by the
                                parties of the second part, as under the stipulations of the last
                                preceding section, (9,) shall be the sum of 75,000 clean Mexican
                                dollars, payable at the port of Kanagawa within nine months after
                                the expiring of this charter-party, with interest.</p>
                            <p>The charter-party ceases and terminates in one month from the date
                                hereof; but it is further agreed between the contracting parties
                                that this charter may be extended for a further period, not
                                exceeding one month, on the same terms and conditions as
                                hereinbefore named, payment being made to the party of the first
                                part by the parties of the second part pro rata for the actual time
                                said vessel remains so employed beyond the term of one month.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have now the honor to enclose No. 1, a
                            copy of the convention concluded with the Japanese government, which had
                            been verbally agreed upon when I sent my telegram No. 63, <hi
                                rend="italic">via</hi> San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>I am unable to say that I regard it with unmixed satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>The important admission with which it opens, that “the hostile acts of
                            Mori Daizen, Prince of Nagato and Suwo, were assuming such formidable
                            proportions as to make it difficult for the Tycoon faithfully to observe
                            the treaties,” may justly be interpreted as a deliberate approval of the
                            measures adopted by the representatives of the treaty powers, as well as
                            an admission that their result relieved the Tycoon from the dread
                            inspired by the boldness and success of his daring vassal.</p>
                        <p>This recital is only a more solemn affirmation of the Tycoon’s increasing
                            weakness and danger, which were fully admitted in conferences with his
                            confidential agents; but it is, nevertheless, of great importance as not
                            made in secret, but published openly to the world. It must be regarded
                            as not only justifying all that has been done, but as demonstrating that
                            it would have been unwise to have even delayed action, much less
                            refrained from it altogether, unless we were prepared to give up the
                            rights acquired by treaties.</p>
                        <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0602"/>
                        <p>The declaration embodied in it “that the receipt of money has never been
                            the object of the treaty powers, but the establishment of better
                            relations with Japan, and the desire to place them on a more
                            satisfactory and mutually advantageous footing is still the leading
                            object in view,” met my most hearty approval. It is highly honorable to
                            the treaty powers, and will, in my judgment, if acted on, greatly
                            promote their interests. It would be a great misfortune should the
                            opinion prevail that money alone can atone for injuries.</p>
                        <p>I am, moreover, fully satisfied that whatever is paid by the Japanese
                            government for indemnities or expenses to foreign governments will, in
                            some form or other, be assessed on their commerce.</p>
                        <p>The panic which in May, 1863, grew out of the measures of coercion
                            threatened when payment of the sum demanded by the British government
                            was refused, led to exorbitant charges for wages of coolies, hire of
                            cargo boats, &amp;c., &amp;c. When finally paid, those charges were
                            somewhat moderated, but are still far above their original standard; and
                            a perpetual tax imposed on foreign commerce is now in process of
                            collection, which, added to the losses sustained by the re-exportation
                            of goods at that time, and on which duties had been paid, are estimated
                            by intelligent merchants to already exceed the large sum imposed as a
                            fine on this government.</p>
                        <p>The British minister and myself, prior to meeting the Japanese
                            commissioners, had agreed on two millions of dollars as the sum to be
                            paid, and would have had no difficulty in its division among the powers
                            interested. But some difference was suggested as likely to arise from
                            the considerations whether the moral support afforded was not entitled
                            to weight in such adjustment, and I did not feel that it was incumbent
                            on me to interpose any objection to this view, as the moral support
                            afforded by the United States was considerably in excess of the material
                            support I was enabled to give. I therefore readily agreed to the
                            reference of this delicate question to the home governments, with the
                            understanding that a memorandum which I prepared should be signed and
                            accompany the convention, so as to provide an equitable basis, if any
                            should become desirable or necessary by reason of payment of the
                            indemnity being demanded by them. I assented the more readily to the
                            proposition of the envoy of his Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the
                            French to fix the amount at three millions of dollars, because I thought
                            it more likely to lead to the substitution of a port as a material
                            compensation for the expenses of the expedition.</p>
                        <p>Should the Tycoon be averse to the opening of another port, and fail to
                            make such offer in lieu of the payment of indemnities and expenses, the
                            amount agreed on will not be regarded as unreasonable. But should he
                            make the offer, it will be at the option of the four powers to accept it
                            in full or in part payment, and in that event a moderate pecuniary fine
                            may be imposed.</p>
                        <p>In either case provision will be made for a reasonable indemnity for
                            injuries sustained by the Wyoming and Monitor, and for the insult to our
                            flag offered by the attack on those vessels, as well as on the Pembroke,
                            the owners of which have received from the Japanese government a sum
                            which covers their loss as estimated by themselves.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor further to enclose—</p>

                            <p>The representatives of the United States of America. Great Britain,
                                France, and the Netherlands, in view of the hostile acts of Mori
                                Daizen, Prince of Nagato and Suwo, which were assuming such
                                formidable proportions as to make it difficult for the Tycoon
                                faithfully to observe the treaties, having been obliged to send
                                their combined forces to the straits of Simonoseki in order to
                                destroy the batteries erected by that Daimio for the destruction of
                                foreign vessels and the stoppage of trade, and the government of the
                                Tycoon, on whom devolved the duty of chastising this rebellious
                                prince, being held responsible for any damage resulting to the
                                interests of treaty powers, as well as the expenses occasioned by
                                the expedition:</p>
                            <p>The undersigned representatives of treaty powers, and Sakai
                                Hida-no-kami, a member of the second council, invested with
                                plenipotentiary powers by the Tycoon of Japan, animated with a
                                desire to put an end to all reclamations concerning the acts of
                                aggression and hostility committed by the said Mori Daizen since the
                                first of these acts, in June, 1863, against the flags of divers
                                treaty powers, and at the same time to regulate definitively the
                                question of indemnities of war, of whatever kind, in respect to the
                                allied expedition to Simonoseki, have agreed and determined upon the
                                four articles following:</p>
                            <p>1. The amount payable to the four powers is fixed at three millions
                                of dollars, ($3,000,000.) This sum to include all claims of whatever
                                nature for past aggressions on the part of Nagato, whether
                                indemnities, ransom for Simonoseki, or expenses entailed by the
                                operations of the allied squadrons.</p>
                            <p>2. The whole sum to be payable quarterly, in instalments of
                                one-sixth, or half a million dollars, ($500,000,) to begin from the
                                date when the representatives of said powers shall make known to the
                                Tycoon’s government the ratification of the convention and the
                                instructions of their respective governments.</p>
                            <p>3. Inasmuch as the receipt of money has never been the object of the
                                said powers, but the establishment of better relations with Japan,
                                and the desire to place these on a more satisfactory and mutually
                                advantageous footing is still the leading object in view, therefore,
                                if his Majesty the Tycoon wishes to offer, in lieu of the payment of
                                the sum claimed, and as a material compensation for loss and injury
                                sustained, the opening of Simonoseki or some other eligible port in
                                the Inland sea, it shall be at the option of the said foreign
                                governments to accept the same, or insist on the payment of the
                                indemnity in money, under the condition above stipulated.</p>
                            <p>4. This convention to be formally ratified by the Tycoon’s government
                                within fifteen days from the date thereof.</p>
                            <p>In token of which, the respective plenipotentiaries have signed and
                                sealed this convention in quintuplicate, with English, Dutch, and
                                Japanese versions, whereof the English shall be considered the
                                original.</p>

                                    his Majesty the Tycoon, providing for the payment by him of a
                                    gross sum of three millions of dollars ($3,000,000) for
                                    indemnities and expenses occasioned by the hostile acts of the

                                    such convention, that entered into at Paris with the
                                    commissioners of the Tycoon, (not ratified by the Tycoon because
                                    of other provisions,) in and by which the payment of one hundred
                                    and forty thousand dollars ($140,000) was to be made to the
                                    government of his Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the French for
                                    the attack on the Kienchang; and as such sum, or a larger one,
                                    may be justly claimed, and as the governments of the United

                                    indemnities for more serious attacks on national and merchant
                                    ships of those countries by the same prince, it is reserved for
                                    those governments to decide if any, and what, indemnities from
                                    said gross amount so to be paid by the Japanese government shall

                        <p>Upon the testimony received relative to the destruction by fire of the
                            legation buildings at Yedo, the President considers it to have been
                            offensive and criminal, not an accidental occurrence, and this
                            government will expect indemnity therefor. Should you come to a
                            different conclusion, however, the subject will be reconsidered.</p>
                        <p>It is deemed proper that you should insist on a residence at Yedo, and it
                            is hoped that the Japanese government will throw no obstacles in the way
                            of your return thither.</p>
                        <p>The President justly appreciates the difficulties which surrounded your
                            position, and does not doubt that Congress will indemnify you for all
                            needful expenses or losses.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of September 28, No. 60, has
                            been received. Whatever may be the end of the present complications in
                            Japan, it is certain that the events occurring there are rapidly raising
                            the curtain which has hitherto secured the political machinery of the
                            empire against the intrusive curiosity of the western powers.</p>
                        <p>It is very instructive to find that the conflicting forces in the
                            Japanese system are the same as in other systems of government, and that
                            the difference between them really lies in the relative development of
                            those identical forces and in their respective combinations. Thus we
                            seem to have now found out that the Mikado is a spiritual power, while
                            the Tycoon is purely a temporal authority; that the aristocracy, while
                            revering the spiritual authority, control it, and employ it to embarrass
                            the temporal government.</p>
                        <p>Your despatch now before me brings into relief a third political force,
                            that of combinations of artisans or trade associations, counteracting
                            and modifying the action of both the spiritual and the temporal
                            power.</p>
                        <p>The more you enable us to understand the constitution of the government
                            and of society in Japan, the more weight the President inclines to give
                            to your suggestion, that as soon as practicable the western powers ought
                            to take measures to have the treaties they have already made with the
                            Tycoon ratified and confirmed by the Mikado.</p>
                        <p>I have already invited the attention of the British government to the
                            suggestion, and I am informed that they are holding it under
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>The President’s message and the accompanying documents will inform you of
                            the cheerful aspect of our domestic affairs, and if surprised, you will
                            at the same time be gratified to learn that it is only in Japan that we
                            are apprehending collision with a foreign enemy.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your several despatches, numbered and
                            dated as follows, have been received: No. 73, November 11; No. 74,
                            November 13; No. 75, November 16; Nos. 76, 77 and 78, dated November 28,
                            and No. 79, dated December 1, 1863.</p>
                        <p>The course pursued by you at the interview with the three governors sent
                            to you by the Gorogio, as detailed in your No. 74, was very proper, and
                            the result proves it to have been judicious. You are instructed to
                            express to the Gorogio the President’s satisfaction at the withdrawal of
                            the letter of Ogasawara, which had raised a very grave and perilous
                            question.</p>
                        <p>I have carefully read the correspondence which accompanies your No. 78,
                            on the subject of your return to Yedo, and I fully appreciate the
                            difficulties and danger which surround your position. The resumption of
                            your residence there, even if it were not so important as it is believed
                            to be, ought to be insisted upon; but the question as to the time of
                            your return, in which your own personal safety as well as that of others
                            connected with the legation is involved, is left entirely to your
                            discretion.</p>
                        <p>The President is gratified to learn that the claim of the owners of the
                            Pembroke has been satisfactorily adjusted. Your offer to settle the case
                            of the Wyoming on the basis named in your No. 76, viz., the provision of
                            annuities for the families of the dead and for the wounded of that
                            vessel is approved, and should it be accepted you will forego further
                            demands on that subject.</p>

                            interview of the day before with the senior governor, and four other
                            governors for foreign affairs, has been read with much interest. You
                            were quite right in the assurance you gave them, that an embassy from
                            their government would be received here with attention and respect. It
                            should be clearly understood, however, that this must not suspend the

                            ministers for foreign affairs, &amp;c., of which a copy accompanies your
                            No. 2, you have <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0612"/>faithfully
                            carried out the instructions communicated in my No. 46, of the 1st of
                            September last, both as to the demands themselves and the manner of
                            making them. As stated by you, these demands—which the President hopes,
                            and indeed confidently expects, have ere this been complied with by the
                            Japanese government—are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1st. The payment of the sum of $10,000 for the public and private
                            property injured and destroyed by the burning of the legation
                            building.</p>
                        <p>2d. That diligent efforts be made to discover the incendiaries and bring
                            them to condign punishment; also, that adequate guarantees be given for
                            your safe return to Yedo, the permanent establishment of the legation
                            there without delay, and the immediate rebuilding of your late
                            residence.</p>
                        <p>3d. The full observance of the treaties between the United States and
                            Japan, in all the particulars which have not heretofore been waived or
                            postponed by the government of the United States.</p>
                        <p>4th. The payment of $20,000, in satisfaction of injuries sustained by
                            citizens of the United States at the hands of the Japanese subjects
                            during the late disturbances in the empire; also, that diligent efforts
                            be made to bring the aggressors to justice, and to inflict upon them
                            such punishment as will be calculated to prevent further outrages of the
                            same kind.</p>
                        <p>5th. The return of George Horton to his residence at the Bonin islands,
                            or the payment of the sum of $2,000 as an indemnity for his use.</p>
                        <p>I have attentively read the correspondence between Mr. Humbert, minister
                            plenipotentiary of the Swiss Confederation in Japan, and yourself, a
                            copy of which accompanies your No. 8, and am happy to express, without
                            hesitation, my approbation of the frank and at the same time
                            conciliatory temper exhibited by you throughout the controversy. To this
                            disposition on your part the prompt correction of the unpleasant
                            misunderstanding was no doubt largely due: and the department learns
                            with satisfaction, though not with surprise, that your friendly
                            relations with Mr. Humbert remain undisturbed.</p>
                        <p>With the expression of my approval of the course pursued by you in
                            relation to the individual charged with the murder, at Shanghai, of
                            Captain Mackennon, I reserve a further answer to your despatch No. 4,
                            until the result shall be known of your efforts to have the alleged
                            culprit arrested at Nagasaki, and sent to Shanghai for delivery to our
                            consul there. The courteous offer of assistance in this matter made to
                            you by Captain Sir Roderick Dew, of her Britannic Majesty’s steamship
                            Encounter, is highly appreciated.</p>

                            inform you that all your proceedings therein related in regard to the
                            claims of this government upon Japan are approved. You will insist on
                            these demands, and on an adjustment of them, to be made with yourself,
                            by the imperial government there. This government cannot consent to
                            withdraw them from your care and open a discussion upon them at this
                            capital. Nor will you consent to a delay of them with a view to such an
                            opening of negotiations here.</p>

                        <p>While explaining these positions to the government of the Tycoon, you
                            will, at the same time, express the sincere desire of the President that
                            a prompt adjustment of claims so just and so moderate will avert the
                            disturbance of the good relations we have hitherto held with
                            Japan—relations which are believed to be as useful to that country as to

                            all of them dated the 30th of January last, have been received.</p>
                        <p>Your proceedings with reference to the convention for the reduction of
                            duties, a copy of which accompanied your No. 12, are approved. By the
                            next mail I hope to be able to send you, as you request, the printed
                            rules of the Treasury Department for the regulation of bonded

                        <p>I have communicated so much of your No. 14 as relates to the exchange of
                            the ratifications of the treaty between Prussia and Japan to Baron Von
                            Gerolt. We do not attach any importance to the charge made by Baron
                            Rehfus, the Prussian consul general in China, that you have been using
                            your influence to delay the negotiations between his government and that
                            of the Tycoon. It no doubt had its origin in the cause you suggest, and
                            we have entire confidence in your ability to vindicate yourself. No
                            complaints of the kind have been preferred against you here.</p>

                            the Mikado, to which reference is made in your despatch No. 16, will
                            result in the establishment of a more cordial understanding between
                            them, and lead to a more favorable foreign policy.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Lord Lyons has, by direction of Earl
                            Russell, her Britannic Majesty’s principal secretary of state for
                            foreign affairs, submitted to me, for my perusal, in confidence, a copy
                            of the earl’s instructions of the 26th of July to Sir Rutherford Alcock,
                            in relation to the course to be pursued by him at the present moment in
                            regard to the existing troubles in Japan.</p>
                        <p>The instructions are based on a voluminous correspondence between Sir
                            Rutherford Alcock and his government, in which he has included a note,
                            addressed by you to him on the 13th of May last, in which you fully
                            discussed the Japanese relations towards the western powers.</p>
                        <p>The sum of Earl Russell’s note is, that his policy concurs with the views
                            which are expressed in your aforementioned note. It may be stated as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>1st. To give every encouragement and support to such of the Tycoon’s
                            ministers, and to such of the Daimios as are favorable to foreign trade,
                            and thus lead to the ultimate revoking of the feudal system and of the
                            exclusive theory of Japan.</p>
                        <p>2d. To make arrangements with the Japanese government for the protection
                            of the foreign settlements at Yokohama.</p>
                        <p>3d. To keep for the present a strong squadron in the Japanese seas.</p>
                        <p>4th. To endeavor to establish an understanding with the government of
                            France, the Netherlands, and the United States, with a view to our
                            common interest in Japan.</p>
                        <p>I have now to inform you that the President approves of the policy thus
                            defined.</p>
                        <p>In the present condition of our affairs we shall probably find it
                            inconvenient to keep constantly a naval force in the Japanese seas, but
                            we shall endeavor to have some one vessel appear there so often as to
                            make a suitable impression upon the Japanese government.</p>
                        <p>The substance of this instruction will be made known to her Britannic
                            Majesty’s government.</p>

                            suspending, for the time being, the departure of the steam gunboat
                            Funayma, built at New York for the Japanese government.</p>
                        <p>It is to be hoped, however, that you may be able to inform this

                            dated August 10, and No. 54, dated August 13, have been received, and
                            have been read with much interest. The proceedings referred to in your
                            latest communication were important, as well as apparently necessary,
                            and it is earnestly hoped that your predictions may be verified by the
                            result of the expedition sent to punish Choshu, and to open the straits
                            of Simonoseki.</p>
                        <p>The disposition you propose to make of the sum paid to you as indemnity
                            for losses occasioned by the firing of the legation building at Yedo is
                            approved, and the department sees no objection to your defraying out of
                            the interest money received by you in payment of the Pembroke claim the
                            expenses incident to the presence of the Jamestown at Yedo, &amp;c.,
                            provided the consent of the owners of the Pembroke be previously
                            obtained. This would appear to be a necessary precaution to guard
                            against any future reclamation which might be made by the parties
                            interested in this case.</p>
